        "page_content": "## A letter from Chair and CEO Brian Moynihan\n\nTo our shareholders,\n\nTo our clients,\n\nTo my teammates,\n\nTo leaders and partners in the communities we serve,\n\n## It is my pleasure to share with you the 2021 Bank of America Annual Report.\n\nThe following pages detail how, over the past year, your company once again fulfilled our purpose to make financial lives better-and did so in a way that benefitted clients, teammates, shareholders and society alike. Against a backdrop of the global pandemic and its ongoing challenges, we delivered Responsible Growth.\n\nWith that in mind, I begin this report by thanking my /two.text/zero.text/eight.text,/zero.text /zero.text /zero.text teammates around the world whose efforts and dedication made this all possible. While thanking my teammates overall, I particularly join them in thanking three senior colleagues who were instrumental in our success over the last several years and retired at the end of /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text Anne Finucane, Tom Montag and Andrea Smith. These leaders delivered for our employees and our shareholders and were truly great colleagues. One of the testaments to their leadership was their work to develop strong talent to succeed them and continue the company's mission. You can see on page /one.text/three.text our current management team reflecting their development efforts.\n\nI would also like to thank our Board of Directors, and our Lead Independent Director, Lionel Nowell III, for their leadership. We also recognize and give our appreciation to Tom May and Sue Bies, two directors who are retiring and will not stand for reelection at\n\n/three.text-year stock performance /three.text-year stock performance\n\n/five.text-year stock performance /three.text-year stock performance\n\n/one.text/zero.text-year stock performance /three.textGLYPH<30> -year stock performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndex\n\n1 U.S. Large Cap (LC) Peers include JPM, C, WFC, GS and MS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndex\n\n|\n\nour annual shareholders' meeting. Tom came to a predecessor company's board in /one.text/nine.text/nine.text/four.text. He became a board member of Bank of America in /two.text/zero.text/zero.text/four.text and led our Audit and Corporate Governance, ESG and Sustainability Committees as chair. Sue became a board member in /two.text/zero.text/zero.text/nine.text at the height of the financial crisis. Both of these colleagues have provided tremendous wisdom to all of us. Lionel offers his perspective on our company's performance in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, and his outlook for the future, on page /one.text/zero.text.\n\nBy virtually any measure, /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text was a successful year for our company and you, our shareholders.\n\nWe earned a record $/three.text/two.text./zero.text billion, or $/three.text./five.text/seven.text per diluted share, on $/eight.text/nine.text./one.text billion in revenue. We increased total assets to $/three.text./two.text trillion as we grew deposits to more than $/two.text trillion. Asset quality remained strong with net charge-offs of customer loans nearing a /five.text/zero.text-year low. We maintained high levels of capital and liquidity.\n\nFor the year, our stock price increased /four.text/seven.text%, outpacing the S&P /five.text/zero.text/zero.text and the broader bank index. Whether you are a new shareholder or someone who has held the stock for many years, our stock has performed well. At year-end /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, our /three.text-, /five.text-, and /one.text/zero.text -year stock price improvement all outperformed the broader bank index, and our /one.text/zero.text-year performance was over /seven.text/zero.text/zero.text %.",

        "page_content": "We also increased our quarterly stock dividend by /one.text/seven.text%. Including share repurchases, we returned nearly $/three.text/two.text billion in capital back to shareholders in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text. In thinking about the work your team has done, I thought the following chart would give some perspective. Starting with our beginning base of common equity at January /one.text, /two.text/zero.text/one.text/zero.text, you will note across the /one.text/two.text years, we have earned $/one.text/seven.text/seven.text billion of net income, paid out $/five.text/three.text billion in common and preferred dividends, and had net buybacks of $/eight.text/six.text billion, for a total return of capital of $/one.text/three.text/nine.text billion. So while providing all the support for clients and communities and producing these shareholder returns, our $/two.text/four.text/five.text billion of common equity is still /one.text/eight.text% stronger than the /two.text/zero.text/one.text/zero.text st ar ting point. The reduction in shares outstanding is also noteworthy, moving from /nine.text./nine.text billion in /two.text/zero.text/one.text/zero.text to less than /eight.text./one.text billion as we ended /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text. So a shareholder who kept his or her shares from /two.text/zero.text/one.text/zero.text until now owns about /one.text/eight.text% more of the company. And, over the same time period, our book value per share is /four.text/six.text% higher.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: 1/1/10 common equity includes the adoption of FAS 166/167 and the Common Equivalent Securities which were converted to common stock on 2/24/10.\n\nAmounts may not total due to rounding.\n\nEven with all that capital return, we still have an extremely strong capital position, witnessed by our common equity tier /one.text (CET/one.text) ratio of /one.text/zero.text./six.text%, well above our minimum requirements.\n\nAs we think about our core operations in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we returned to delivering the organic growth experienced prior to the pandemic. Across our eight lines of business, we once again deepened relationships with existing clients and earned the trust of new ones. We deployed our capabilities, expertise and balance sheet to help our clients achieve their financial goals. We focused on the needs of our clients-one client at a time-and held client experience scores at near-record highs.\n\nWhile supporting clients, we also invested to support our teammates around the globe, as part of our commitment to being a great place to work. We expanded benefits and resources to promote health, wellness and safety for our teammates and their families. See more in the 'Making our company a great place to work' section of this letter.\n\nWe also delivered for communities to help them thrive. We will discuss the many ways we did this throughout this report, and we provide an update on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics that we first reported upon in last year's report. Examples of outcomes we have delivered include: helping business clients prepare for and transition toward a low-carbon future, promoting greater racial equality and economic opportunity wherever we operate, and tripling our affordable homeownership commitment to help more low- to moderate-income clients build generational wealth through the purchase of a home.\n\nAll of this-and so much more-helped us achieve the best year of earnings in company history. And we did it all by delivering Responsible Growth.\n\n## Responsible Growth\n\nResponsible Growth is how we drive our company.\n\nIt has four straightforward tenets:\n\n- \u00b7 We must grow and win in the market, no excuses.\n- \u00b7 We must grow with a customer focus.\n- \u00b7 We must grow within our risk framework.\n- \u00b7 We must grow in a sustainable manner.\n\nAnd, to grow in a sustainable manner, we must drive operational excellence, make our company a great place to work, and share our success with communities.\n\nIn /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, our company executed well on each of these tenets.\n\nHere's how we did it.\n\n## Grow and win in the market, no excuses\n\nThe acid test of our success is market share growth achieved by both adding new clients and doing more with the clients we have. In the years leading up to the pandemic, our company had been delivering strong organic growth driven by the power of our franchise and our brand, our best-in-class relationship teams, our great products and our industryleading digital capabilities.\n\nWhen the worldwide health crisis hit in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, we deployed our resources and capabilities to meet the rapidly-evolving financial needs of our clients, in addition to providing support for our teammates and communities. As the economy rebounded from the /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text lows, we've seen client activity normalize and accelerate. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we saw our organic growth engine kick back in.\n\nWe grew deposits by $/two.text/six.text/nine.text billion to a record $/two.text./one.text trillion. We grew loans by $/five.text/one.text billion in the most recent quarter, the fastest rate in our history-with the exception of the rapid drawdowns on commercial lines of credit we experienced early in the pandemic.\n\nFor retail clients, which includes our Consumer as well as Wealth Management clients, deposits grew to $/one.text./four.text trillion",

        "page_content": "and we retained our spot as the top bank in the country by retail deposits. Importantly, we added nearly /one.text million net new checking accounts, which are predominantly core transaction accounts for our clients. At the same time, we added more than half a million new Consumer Investment accounts as a growing number of clients chose to invest and manage their funds through Merrill Edge, our well-established digital investment platform. This helped Consumer Investment assets grow /two.text/zero.text% over the course of /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text. And we added millions of new credit card accounts.\n\nWe strengthened our leadership positions in both our hightech and high-touch channels. We saw record engagement across our digital channels, which I will discuss later in this letter. And while digital customer behavior increased, we also recognize the continued need for a strong physical delivery network supporting all our businesses.\n\nWe continued our geographical financial center expansion work in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, bringing our brand to new cities while also optimizing our presence in existing markets. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we refreshed nearly /four.text/zero.text/zero.text financial centers and opened /eight.text/two.text financial centers, /four.text/one.text of which were in our expansion markets, including Denver, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh as well as locations in Ohio and Kentucky. We continued to gain retail deposit market share in key markets. In /two.text/five.text of the top /three.text /zero.text markets across America, we remain ranked the #/one.text, #/two.text, or #/three.text bank. In /one.text/six.text of those markets - more than three times the number of our closest peer-we are the #/one.text bank.\n\nWe are focused on growth with efficiency, i.e., adding branches and gaining scale in markets effectively rather than spreading them around. For example, in Minneapolis we have approximately $/three.text billion in deposits from our Retail business and are the #/seven.text position in the market. We did not have a retail presence in Minneapolis prior to /two.text/zero.text/one.text/five.text. And average deposit size in branches is $/two.text/one.text/seven.text million, already /one.text./four.text times the average in the industry. This shows the strength of our brand.\n\nDuring the year, we also continued to enhance our flagship loyalty program, Preferred Rewards, which recognizes and rewards clients for doing business with us across all products. Preferred Rewards memberships grew to /nine.text./four.text million, an /one.text/one.text% year-over-year increase, and we once again saw /nine.text/nine.text% retention rates from our members.\n\nWe also delivered products and personalized care to help our /one.text/one.text million business owner clients achieve their financial goals. We continue to be among the nation's largest Small Business lenders, ending /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text with $/two.text/two.text billion in total outstanding loans. Small Business clients benefitted from our awardwinning digital tools and the advice of Business Advantage specialists in /two.text,/four.text/zero.text/zero.text financial centers.\n\nAt the same time, we continued to innovate and enhance the products and services we offer to merchants, driving new clients and additional volume through our Merchant Services platform.\n\nIn our wealth management business-Merrill and The Private Bank-we saw record client flows during /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text of $/one.text/four.text/nine.text billion. Total client assets ended the year at $/three.text./eight.text trillion, up /one.text/five.text% from /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text. Profit margins in the business lead the industry. Importantly, we continued to drive holistic client relationships as deposits in our Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) business grew to $/three.text/nine.text/zero.text billion, up more than /two.text/zero.text%. Standalone, our GWIM business would be a top /one.text/zero.text U.S. bank by deposits. Average loans also grew during /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text to nearly $/two.text/zero.text /zero.text billion, having grown now for /four.text/seven.text straight quarters, even throughout the pandemic.\n\nFor commercial and corporate clients, we raised $/nine.text/six.text/three.text billion in capital in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text to help them build new manufacturing facilities, hire workers, and evolve their business models to meet future opportunities-including their transition to more sustainable operations. So as one considers the capital repurchases shown in the earlier chart, one might ask, 'Should we have used the capital we used for buybacks to help our clients?' The answer is: we did that, too. During the same /one.text/two.text-year period in which we returned $/one.text/three.text/nine.text billion of capital to shareholders, we also provided $/eight.text./six.text trillion in capital raising for our corporate clients.\n\nCommercial loan balances grew /nine.text% to $/five.text/four.text/three.text billion during /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text. We helped companies manage their cash and saw our Global Transaction Services revenue grow to more than $/seven.text./two.text billion. And our Investment Banking team had three of its best quarters in the company's history in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, leading to a record $/eight.text./nine.text billion in investment banking fees.\n\nIn our Global Markets business, our teams also had a very strong year amid continued market volatility. Our sales and trading revenue of more than $/one.text/five.text billion was the best in a decade. We continue to invest in this business, most notably by deploying more than $/one.text/five.text/zero.text billion in additional balance sheet to support client growth.\n\nIn /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, each of our businesses contributed to our record results and we grew and won in the market.\n\n## Grow with a customer focus\n\nThe second tenet of Responsible Growth is to grow with a customer focus. Our growth has to be organic: For nearly /three.text /zero.text years, a bank with /one.text/zero.text% or more of the deposits in the U.S. has not been permitted to acquire a U.S. deposittaking institution. Our growth comes from focusing upon and fulfilling client needs. We focus on what they need and the service and relationship quality we must bring to\n\n$2.1T We grew deposits to a record $2.1T in 2021.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "them to meet their needs. We also focus on all the ways to servehigh-tech and high-touch -it is our advantage to have massively-scaled platforms in each area.\n\nIn /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we saw record client engagement across our hightech digital platforms. Our continued growth in digital enrollment and engagement has been instrumental to our success in deepening client relationships while reducing costs and driving greater efficiencies across our businesses.\n\nIn Consumer, we added /two.text million active digital banking users during /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, the fastest annual numerical growth in digital users in our company's history. As of the end of the year, we had /five.text/four.text million verified users with /four.text/one.text million active, i.e., engaged in the past /nine.text/zero.text days. Those users logged into their accounts /one.text/zero.text./five.text billion times during /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text. In addition to helping clients manage their accounts, digital has been a key driver of our sales. For example, in the fourth quarter of /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, /eight.text/six.text% of all deposit transactions were digital. At the same time, /four.text/six.text% of all consumer sales came through digital channels, up from /three.text/two.text% pre-pandemic. During the past five years, all product sales have been fully digitally enabled to allow this growth to happen. You can open a checking account, get a mortgage, get a home equity loan, a credit card or invest, all through a fully digital process.\n\nWe also see more and more clients turning to Erica\u00ae, our artificial intelligence (AI)-based virtual financial assistant, for help keeping up with managing their finances. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, total Erica interactions from our clients increased threefold to /four.text/two.text/seven.text million. We continued to expand Erica's capabilities to make it easier for clients to manage their financial lives. Erica has proven to be a critical channel in helping us deliver important information to clients and addressing their questions and concerns in real-time.\n\nSo what is Erica? Natural language processing, AI, data aggregation and analysis sitting on a massive infrastructure to deliver in real-time the 'answer' to any question. But it is useful beyond clients as it can help our teammates work better.\n\nErica is also a part of our operational platform, delivering efficiencies and reducing manual intervention to help our client-facing teammates. For example, our Erica-driven BankerAssist internal platform is saving our Global Banking teams /four.text/zero.text,/zero.text /zero.text /zero.text hours of work each year, and reducing their client response times by two-thirds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $35B+\n\nIn the past 12 years, we've invested more than $35B to build a powerful, more secure and scalable technology platform .\n\nThe power of our digital tools is also changing the way clients send and receive money. During /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, the number of clients who are active Zelle\u00ae users-both consumers and small businesses-increased /two.text/three.text% to /one.text/five.text./eight.text million. These users sent and received $/two.text/three.text/one.text billion in payments over the course of the year, a /six.text/four.text% increase over /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text. To put our Zelle volumes into perspective, the /seven.text/seven.text/nine.text million Zelle transactions made by our clients during the year surpassed the number of paper check transactions written by our clients for the first time. So why is that important? The check numbers have dropped more than /two.text/five.text% over the past two years. Not processing paper checks saves us money to invest in other activities. It is one of the ways we have been working to reduce the $/five.text billion level of cash/check and related expense we cited in /two.text/zero.text/one.text/seven.text. It continues to fall. The costs get reinvested in more productive activities.\n\nOur digital capabilities have also been a powerful driver of client engagement and satisfaction within our wealth management businesses. Our Merrill clients are /seven.text/nine.text% digitally active while our Private Bank clients are /eight.text/five.text% digitally active. And, we continue to make steady progress with clients accepting paperless statements across the franchise. As face-to-face meetings returned in part from their /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text hiatus, our advisors continued to leverage the strength of our digital platforms to connect with, and address the individual needs of, our clients. In the fourth quarter of /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text alone, our Merrill Lynch advisors sent /one.text./five.text million secure messages to our clients, and our clients signed /two.text/three.text/zero.text,/zero.text/zero.text/zero.text forms digitally /four.text/seven.text % of all eligible transactions. This is all simply easier for our clients.\n\nOur commercial clients, too, are using our digital capabilities to manage their company's finances from wherever they are-and they're doing it in record numbers. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we saw a /five.text/five.text% increase in active users of our CashPro app. With a simple tap on their phone (or even their watch), those users-CFOs and finance leaders from companies around the world-approved $/three.text/eight.text/four.text billion in payments during /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, a /one.text/one.text/nine.text % increase in approval volumes over the previous year.\n\nWe continue to deliver new capabilities to help support finance operations for our commercial clients. In January /two.text/zero.text/two.text /two.text, we launched CashPro Forecasting, a tool that uses AI and machine learning technology to more accurately and efficiently predict clients' future cash positions.\n\nThe digital strength and success we demonstrated in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text including the many industry awards and recognition we received-did not happen overnight. It is the product of years of investment and innovation. In the /one.text/two.text years cited above, we have invested more than $/three.text/five.text billion in new technology initiatives, including code development and related initiatives, to build a powerful, more secure and scalable technology platform with market-leading capabilities. This platform has helped us deliver a best-in-class digital experience for our clients, and efficient operating platform for our teammates. It is also a key driver in cost reduction for our company.",

And, in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we served our clients well through our nationwide network of /four.text,/two.text/zero.text/zero.text financial centers and /one.text/six.text,/zero.text /zero.text /zero.text ATMs as well as on the phone, in our offices and through our chat capabilities.

It remains one of the fastest product rollouts in our company's history, and is helping us build and support long-term relationships with millions of clients.\n\nTo help guide our efforts to meet our consumer clients' and communities' needs, we founded our National Community Advisory Council (NCAC) /one.text/six.text years ago. During /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, the NCAC continued to provide an important external perspective to help us understand, design and deliver products to help meet the needs of our communities-particularly low- to moderate-income communities. We talk more about the role of the NCAC on page /three.text/three.text.\n\n## Grow within our risk framework\n\nA decade-plus of managing risk through a well-understood framework positioned us to be a source of strength for our clients, teammates and communities when the health crisis hit in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text. Against the backdrop of an unprecedented economic decline during the pandemic, we built up significant reserves for potential credit losses. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, as the economy recovered, we released $/six.text./eight.text billion of those reserves as our credit losses hit historic lows. Importantly, while reserves were built in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text and reduced in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text due to accounting rules, the credit risk in our company continues to be managed extremely well. You can see in the chart below a /one.text/two.text-year view of net charge-offs-the losses we actually take. They reached a /five.text/zero.text-year low during /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text.\n\nEffective risk management means we take the right risk, through the right processes and controls, to grow our business while also protecting our balance sheet. It is key to\n\ndriving the type of record loan growth we saw in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text and positioning ourselves for long-term success.\n\nThe right risk is also key to delivering strong results in the markets. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, our Global Markets teams navigated volatile markets to deliver strong sales and trading results, with only nine days of trading losses throughout the entire year. And we supported the needs of our institutional clients through dynamic market environments.\n\nRecognizing and managing risk is integral to how my teammates drive Responsible Growth every day. That applies to the /eight.text,/zero.text/zero.text /zero.text -plus teammates in our Risk, Compliance and Audit functions as well as all of my teammates worldwide. It is core to who we are. We continue to promote a culture of risk management at every level of the company, and mitigate operational risk through our focus on operational excellence.\n\n## Grow in a sustainable manner\n\nTo drive Responsible Growth, our growth must be sustainable. That means three things. First, we drive operational excellence so we can reinvest the savings produced in our capabilities, our teammates and our communities. Second, we do all we can to be a great place to work for our teammates so we can attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients. Third, we share our success so we can support the communities in which we work and live.\n\n## Driving operational excellence\n\nOperational excellence is how we create the means to reduce costs across our platform and reinvest savings into the things that are important to us: our team, our capabilities, our client experience, our communities and our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "By pursuing operational excellence, we drive continuous improvement, reduce risk, and identify faster, simpler and more efficient ways of working and serving our clients. Our focus on operational excellence has helped us maintain expense discipline and reduce unnecessary jobs as the number of clients we serve each day-and therefore the amount and type of work our team does-has grown significantly. For perspective, the chart below shows how the team has effectively managed this across time. Assets have grown $/nine.text/three.text/nine.text billion, while our headcount was reduced /two.text/six.text % and expense is /one.text/six.text% lower, /one.text even after absorbing inflation and cost-of-living type increases.\n\nOver the same period, we have invested billions in technology initiatives, added new sales teammates, opened more than /four.text /zero.text /zero.text new financial centers and renovated almost /two.text,/four.text/zero.text/zero.text more. And for /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text -/two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we've added more than $/one.text billion net each year in COVID-related expenses to support the health and safety of our teammates and ensure our company can continue to deliver for our clients and communities.\n\nDespite continued high levels of investment, we grew revenue faster than expenses in the second half of /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text and saw the return to the positive operating leverage we experienced prior to the pandemic-when we achieved that for /one.text/eight.text straight quarters. As we look to /two.text/zero.text/two.text/two.text and beyond amid a strengthening economy and expected rising interest rates-we expect that our success driving operational excellence will continue to provide powerful leverage and help us deliver for all those we serve while continuing our investment in the future of the franchise.\n\n## Making our company a great place to work\n\nAttracting and retaining top talent is a critical part of how we deliver for our clients and our communities. That is particularly true in the current tight labor market. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we continued to invest to make our company a great place to work for all teammates. You can read more about how we are investing in teammates in our Human Capital Management update on pages /three.text/eight.text-/five.text/one.text.\n\nAmid the ongoing pandemic, these investments included expanded benefits and resources to support the health and safety of our teammates and their families. We offered free coronavirus testing, paid time-off for teammates to receive vaccinations and boosters, and vaccination clinics in our offices around the world, just to name a few.\n\nAnother way we make our company a great place to work is by fostering a diverse and inclusive (D&I) workplace. We want our workforce to reflect the communities we serve across all dimensions. And in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we made important progress toward that goal.\n\nThe policies we put in place around our D&I efforts help promote transparency, accountability and continued progress. We embed diverse representation into manager scorecards. We use third-parties to validate equal pay for equal work. And, importantly, we ask our teammates every year to tell us how we are doing. In the /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text employee survey, our employee engagement and D&I index scores were near-record highs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b9 /two.text/zero.text/eight.text/zero.text tot al non-interest expense excludes $/eight.text/two.text./one.text billion goodwill impairment.

        "page_content": "Recognizing and rewarding performance is another priority for us. We want teammates who are invested in our company and our clients, and we dedicate our time and resources to help them build long careers with us. That begins with providing a competitive starting wage and benefits. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we raised our U.S. minimum hourly wage to $/two.text/one.text, on the path to our commitment of $/two.text/five.text by /two.text/zero.text/two.text/five.text. This means that any employee that starts work for our company makes at least $/four.text/three.text,/zero.text/zero.text/zero.text per year with some of the most comprehensive full-time benefits available.\n\nAs I highlighted earlier, we also delivered special compensation awards to teammates for our performance in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, the fifth year we have done so. For /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we increased the value of the award to $/one.text billion, totaling nearly $/three.text./three.text billion in special compensation awards since /two.text/zero.text/one.text/seven.text. Roughly /nine.text/seven.text% of our teammates received an award this year, with the vast majority receiving it in the form of Bank of America stock to help them share in our long-term success. This is over and above all other forms of compensation.\n\nWe also continue to invest in our teammates through a progressive compensation model. Each year, teammates with lower salaries, on average, receive higher compensation increases as a percentage of salary when compared to employees with higher salaries. All teammates have been rewarded across time. The chart to the right shows the average annual wage increases for a teammate from /two.text/zero.text/one.text/zero.text through today.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase in annual compensation by compensation cohort for an employee from /two.text/zero.text/one.text/zero.text until today Increase in annual compensation by compensation cohort for an employee from /two.text/zero.text/one.text/zero.text until today\n\n| Cohort Cohort                     | Average annual increase A v erage annual increase   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| <$50K < $ 50 K                    | 8% 8%                                               |\n| $50K to $100K $ 50 K to $100K     | 6% 6 %                                              |\n| $100K to $200K $ 1 0 0 K to $200K | 5% 5 %                                              |\n| $200K+ $200 K+                    | 4% 4 %                                              |\n\nWe continue to provide higher company subsidies for medical premiums for teammates with lower salaries. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/two.text, for the tenth consecutive year, there was no increase in medical premiums for teammates earning less than $/five.text/zero.text,/zero.text/zero.text/zero.text per year. For all other teammates, the average increase in medical premiums has been less than trend growth in medical cost in the marketplace.\n\nSo what is the payback for all this? As you can see on page /four.text/nine.text, our turnover rate in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text - the so called 'great resignation year' -was /one.text/two.text%, comparable to /two.text/zero.text/one.text/nine.text, and /two.text/zero.text% below where we started in /two.text/zero.text/one.text/two.text. That difference is very beneficial to our shareholders and our clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the 2021 employee survey, our Employee Engagement and Diversity & Inclusion Index scores were near-record highs.",

We call it Responsible Growth.\n\nWe align all of our activities to drive progress. That means we bring our $/three.text./two.text trillion balance sheet, our $/six.text/zero.text billion in annual spending, the trillions of dollars in capital we raise each year for our clients, and the volunteer efforts of /two.text/zero.text/eight.text,/zero.text/zero.text/zero.text associates to the task-in addition to our philanthropic initiatives.\n\nFor example, we recognize the value to our business-and to society-of diversity in our supply chain. We expect all our vendors to promote and report on diversity in their own workplaces. We also require U.S. vendors to provide a minimum hourly salary of $/one.text/five.text per hour to employees supporting our company. And we actively seek to do business with certified diverse businesses through our Supplier Diversity Program. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, approximately $/two.text billion of our nearly $/two.text/zero.text billion in annual spend was with diverse suppliers.\n\nAs another example, we committed to deploy $/one.text trillion in financing by /two.text/zero.text/three.text/zero.text - part of a broader $/one.text./five.text trillion commitment aligned to achieving other environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities-to help our clients transition to a low-carbon future. That includes financing to help small businesses adopt more sustainable business practices, and financing to help major corporations in all industries transform and decarbonize their business models. You can read more about our approach to Sustainable Finance on page /three.text/five.text.\n\nYour company is one of the largest underwriters of green bonds, and has helped more than /two.text/two.text/five.text clients support their sustainable business needs by raising in excess of $/three.text/zero.text/zero.text billion through more than /four.text/zero.text/zero.text ESG-themed bond offerings. We were the first U.S. bank to issue a corporate social bond aligned to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a corporate social bond to support the fight against the pandemic, and a corporate equality progress sustainability bond designed to advance racial equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability. We talk more about our ESG initiatives on pages /three.text/six.text-/three.text/seven.text.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n400+\n\nESG-themed bond offerings, including the first corporate social bond aligned to U.N. SDGs\n\n## $1.25B\n\nWe have committed more than $300M in equity to date as part of our $1.25B commitment to racial equality and economic opportunity .\n\nOne of the key ways we help drive progress within our local communities is through our market president organization. Each of our /nine.text/zero.text-plus market presidents serves as chief executive for Bank of America in that market. They lead an integrated team and help us deliver one company for clients, teammates and the broader community. You can read more about our market presidents on page /three.text/two.text.\n\nOur market presidents have also helped us identify more than /one.text/zero.text/zero.text high-impact minority-focused funds across the U.S., which provide capital to Black, Hispanic-Latino, Asian, Native American, other under-represented minority and women entrepreneurs. With their guidance, we have committed more than $/three.text/zero.text/zero.text million in equity to these funds to date, as part of our $/one.text./two.text/five.text billion commitment to racial equality and economic opportunity. These ethnic cohorts have not been represented historically in the private equity business as operators of the funds or as investee companies. So this is a 'win-win': diverse fund managers enabled with our investment take those funds and invest in diverse entrepreneur-owned companies. For more information on how we are investing in diverse entrepreneurs, see page /three.text/four.text.\n\nIn /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text alone, we made $/three.text/seven.text/zero.text million in philanthropic investments to advance economic mobility as part of our efforts to strengthen our communities. This included more than $/nine.text/four.text million to workforce development and education programs, $/eight.text/seven.text million to support housing and small business, and more than $/eight.text/one.text million to meet basic needs such as hunger relief.\n\nOur market presidents also play an important role in helping us deliver our philanthropic efforts at the local level.\n\nIn February /two.text/zero.text/two.text/two.text, working through our network of market presidents, we announced a donation of $/one.text/zero.text./six.text million - one of the largest donations in our company's history-to food banks and hunger organizations across the country. This gift was part of a broader internal company campaign to promote health and safety for our teammates and raise awareness about the importance of COVID-/one.text/nine.text boosters. For every teammate who told us they received a booster by January /three.text/one.text, we donated at least $/one.text/zero.text/zero.text to a local hunger relief organization with the majority of the organizations receiving at least $/two.text/five.text,/zero.text /zero.text /zero.text. I'd like to take a moment to thank the teammates who helped make this gift possible, and the organizations themselves for the important work they do within our local communities.\n\n|",

Each director's unique perspective and expertise helps inform and guide how your company delivers long-term, sustainable value for our\n\nshareholders, and in the communities where we operate.\n\nI would like to recognize the many years of service of our two retiring directors, Tom May and Sue Bies. Tom and Sue have been great colleagues, advisors and leaders on our Board. We will truly miss their wisdom and guidance.\n\nChaired by Brian Moynihan, your Board oversees the company's strategic direction and the execution of that strategy through regular engagement with company leadership. We then oversee the execution of that strategy through regular engagement with company leadership, including formal committee assignments. We work closely with company leaders to evaluate future opportunities and risks, and monitor how the company's direction and decisions align to the four tenets of Responsible Growth, which Brian describes in his letter.\n\nAs we reflect on /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we are encouraged by the company's record earnings, driven by strong\n\nAnother way we share our success with our communities is through the individual giving and volunteering of teammates. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, charitable giving by our teammates, combined with matching gifts from Bank of America, amounted to more than $/seven.text/two.text million. At the same time, our teammates reported /one.text./six.text million volunteer hours during the year, a reflection of their extraordinary engagement and impact within their communities.\n\nWe also use our lending and investing activities to help build strong, sustainable communities across the country. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we provided $/six.text./six.text billion in loans, tax credit equity investments, and other real estate development solutions, and deployed $/four.text./one.text billion in debt commitments and $/two.text./five.text billion in investments. Since /two.text/zero.text/zero.text/five.text, we have financed more than /two.text/six.text/three.text,/zero.text/zero.text /zero.text housing units, of which /eight.text/six.text% are affordable housing.\n\norganic growth, as well as the many steps the company took to support its clients, communities and employees. All of these initiatives and accomplishments position the company well for the future.\n\nSince assuming the role as Lead Independent Director last year, I have enjoyed the frequent opportunities to meet with shareholders about the company's short and longterm performance, ESG practices, and business outlook. I value the insights I receive when speaking with shareholders and other key stakeholders, and look forward to continuing my proactive engagement in the year to come. I will maintain our regular update on company progress as your Board strives to maximize long-term shareholder value.\n\nThank you again for your support and investment in Bank of America.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What would you like the power to do?\n\nSome see a choice between 'shareholder capitalism' and 'stakeholder capitalism'-a term defined by the World Economic Forum half a century ago and adopted by the Business Roundtable and others. But there really is not a choice to be made. Jim Collins, the great business writer, wrote about 'the genius of the AND' in the /one.text/nine.text/nine.text/zero.texts to describe how the most successful companies avoid false choices in how they operate across a range of responsibilities. So, we must do both well: continue to deliver great returns for our shareholders and deliver for society, i.e., the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe way we serve our stakeholders begins with one straightforward question: What would you like the power to do?",

What does the world want the power to do?\n\nThe answer to that question is characterized by the SDGs, which nearly /two.text/zero.text/zero.text countries agreed to in /two.text/zero.text/one.text/five.text. The SDGs reflect /one.text/seven.text categories the global community views as essential toward building a fair and sustainable future for all, including equality of opportunity, affordable housing, prosperity, access to clean water, and renewable energy.\n\nI'm often asked whether the private sector is the right cohort to address these priorities. We firmly believe so. But as a practical matter, it is the only way progress is going to be made. Only the private sector has the money, talent, innovation and long-term thinking needed to deliver the things that society wants: progress on the SDGs.\n\nSo we need to continue to align capitalism to produce the needed progress on the SDGs or it simply won't happen. Here's why:\n\nEstimates suggest the SDGs will require between $/five.text trillion to $/seven.text trillion per year of investment capital.\n\nNon-profits and philanthropy certainly play an important role in delivering funding to the world, but the total assets of all non-profit foundations in the world has been estimated to be around $/one.text./five.text trillion. At the same time, the sum of all annual charitable contributions in a given year is approximately $/one.text trillion. Even if all of that money was directed to the SDGs-leaving aside the many other important causes non-profits are funding today-it would still leave a gap of several trillion dollars per year to fund.\n\nThe public sector, too, has an important role to play, although with budgets stretched thin-especially in the wake of the pandemic-governments alone cannot deliver what society demands. Some say you can make progress happen by regulation or taxation, but those impacts tend to be revisited, then they suffer the inevitable fate of other governmental priorities taking the prioritization or funding away.\n\nThe private sector must play the leading role, working in close collaboration with all sectors of society. We must harness the tens of trillions of dollars in available capital, the trillions of annual expense dollars and supply chain\n\npurchasing, the hiring, the net impact of company-specific net-zero greenhouse gas emissions commitments and the talent and the innovation from companies and investors around the world. We must continue to align capitalism to address society's needs and to deliver for shareholders. There's growing awareness on how to best do that. Your company continues to work with many organizations and leaders around the world who are helping galvanize efforts within the private sector and mobilize capital to address today's most pressing challenges.\n\nHow do we measure the progress we are making against the SDGs? In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, the World Economic Forum's International Business Council, which I am honored to chair, together with the Big Four global accounting firms of Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC, launched a set of universal Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics aligned to the SDGs. These metrics help companies across industries measure and disclose how they are addressing societal priorities (and the SDGs) through their business activities and operations.\n\nTo date, more than /one.text/five.text/zero.text companies around the world have committed to reporting Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and more than /five.text/zero.text of them, including Bank of America, are already including these metrics in their annual reports and other documents. We reported on them for the first time in last year's annual report.\n\nYou can find our updated Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics for this year on page /five.text/four.text. These metrics shed further light on how we assess and deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders, and I invite you to review them in connection with the other information in this report.\n\nAs a financial institution, our success has always beenand will always be-dependent on the success of our clients, the strength of our communities, and the wellbeing of our employees. By focusing on Responsible Growth in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we delivered for those stakeholders AND drove record profits for our shareholders. We also invested to position ourselves to do powerful things in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/two.text and beyond.\n\nThat's the 'genius of the AND.'\n\nOn behalf of my teammates, our management team and the Board of Directors, I thank you for your support of Bank of America.\n\nBrian Moynihan March /one.text, /two.text/zero.text/two.text/two.text\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Our asset-based lending was ranked No. /one.text in the U.S. for lead left and bookrunner by Refinitiv.\n\n## Powering our communities through development and diversity\n\nOur clients place great value on strong, vibrant and diverse communities, so Global Commercial Banking has developed our business model to care for our people, our communities and the environment.\n\nFor example, Bank of America Community Development Banking provides financing for affordable housing and economic development across the U.S. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we provided more than $/six.text./six.text billion in debt and equity financing, creating more than /one.text/one.text,/six.text/zero.text/zero.text units of affordable housing\n\nfor U.S. individuals, families, veterans, seniors and the previously homeless. In addition, we also support the long-term sustainability of communities through financial education programs.\n\nClients are encouraged to consider investing all or a portion of their excess liquidity in green or environmental, social and governance (ESG)-friendly investment options. Additionally, clients are taking advantage of digital treasury solutions and moving away from paper-based solutions.\n\nAnd because our clients strongly support diversity and inclusion, we hosted GCB clients at a total of /one.text/one.text/eight.text diversity and inclusion events around the world.\n\n## 75%\n\nof commercial, corporate and business banking clients are digitally active (CashPro\u00ae & BA360 platforms)\n\n|",

Collectively, these efforts raised $/nine.text/six.text/three.text billion across global capital markets, which contributed to a new high watermark of $/eight.text./nine.text billion in investment banking fees in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, representing an increase of /two.text/four.text% over the previous record set in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text. We see all of these achievements as a sign of our clients' confidence in our people, our expertise and our ability to effectively deliver the full breadth of talent and resources across Bank of America.\n\nAdditionally, GCIB ended the year with a record quarter of investment banking revenues. In corporate banking, a focus on Responsible Growth and strategically supporting our clients saw fourth-quarter absolute loan growth pick up pace, bringing about one of our strongest quarters ever. Average deposits grew through the year, and especially in the fourth quarter with a /two.text/one.text% year-ago-quarter increase driven by organic growth and deal-related inflows.\n\n## A focus on technology and ESG\n\nAs technological innovation accelerates change across all industries and the overall economy, GCIB has leveraged technology to improve our client interactions, uncover insights, increase efficiency and manage risk well. Recent recognition of our continued focus on digital innovation in\n\n/two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text includes awards for Best Mobile Cash Management Software-CashPro (Global Finance) and the No. /one.text ranking in Digital Functionality, Digital Platform Design and Provides End to End Digital Process (Greenwich Associates).\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) and making positive contributions to society are important for Bank of America and, increasingly, for many of our clients. The transition to a low-carbon economy means that a significant flow of capital will have to be put to work in an efficient and effective manner. Our clients will need advice and expertise, and we continue to invest to build this capability. To this end, within GCIB, we have established a new team, ESG Advisory and Financing Solutions, to help our clients across industry sectors determine how ESG impacts their cost of capital and strategic initiatives and to assist them in navigating through climate transition. This new team is well-positioned to advise our clients, as Bank of America continues to be at the forefront of ESG financing-in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, GCIB was the No. /one.text underwriter of U.S. ESG corporate bonds.\n\nAs we look to the future, we will continue to work relentlessly for our clients. We are committed to leveraging our resources and franchise to deliver for them-and grow with them-as a steadfast and trusted partner for the long term.\n\n## GLOBAL CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANKING\n\nProviding advisory, underwriting and banking services to thousands of middle market, emerging growth and large corporate clients worldwide\n\nLed by: Matthew Koder\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Providing coverage for 70% of global companies with market capitalization of $10B+\n- \u00b7 Continued to drive investment banking fee growth, reaching a new high in 2021 of $8.9 billion\n- \u00b7 Named by Global Finance as 2021 Outstanding Financial  Innovator-Global",

This led to an increase in employee satisfaction for them and double-digit growth in new client households using our products.\n- \u00b7 The Private Bank worked with several GCB privately-held business clients to provide pre-transaction planning and advice in advance of the clients selling their businesses.\n- \u00b7 A Merrill wealth management client needing a more robust financial services platform developed a comprehensive, full\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelationship with Business Banking , including deposit and treasury management and lending.\n\n'Our line of business teams deliver together for our clients in Greater D.C. every day,' said D.

'All the while, we are addressing the community's greatest challenges through partnerships with local organizations and leaders who deliver on a global scale.'\n\nGuided by our Responsible Growth principle that success must be shared to be sustainable, the Greater D.C. leadership team invests across this diverse region. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we worked with local partner Building Bridges Across the River for a $/one.textM grant to help construct the /one.text/one.textth Street Bridge Park , Washington's first elevated public park, to be built on the piers of the old /one.text/one.textth Street Bridge across the Anacostia River.

In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, /eight.text/nine.text% of teammates (nearly /one.text/eight.text/two.text,/zero.text/zero.text/zero.text teammates) participated, demonstrating our employees' willingness to give us feedback on how we are meeting their needs.\n\nSince /two.text/zero.text/one.text/two.text, our Employee Engagement Index score has continued to trend upward, even during the global health crisis. Through our enterprise engagement survey, we also measure an internal Diversity & Inclusion Index\u00b9 that gives us feedback on how we measure inclusion at the bank. Our D&I Index has a positive trend over time and exceeds industry benchmarks.\n\nThe results of the survey and the process of continuous improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least annually. Our efforts reflect our progress in being a great place to work.\n\nWe believe our employee turnover reflects the strength of our employee engagement results and how our teammates view the Bank as an employer of choice. Over the past decade,\n\nour turnover rate has decreased and has been among the lowest in the industry. Following a record low turnover rate of /seven.text % in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text reflecting the pandemic environment, like many companies, our turnover did increase in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text as labor markets normalized. Even with that increase in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text, we are seeing employee turnover at a similar rate as pre-pandemic record low levels of /one.text/one.text-/one.text/two.text% turnover, a strong result for a company of our size and scale.\n\nTo help our teammates create long-term careers here, we continue to provide a variety of resources to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills. We have also enhanced our internal mobility practices, which has led to over /five.text /zero.text % of our open roles being filled by internal candidates.\n\n|                         | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Annual turnover         | 11%    | 7%     | 12%    |\n| Annual turnover % women | 11%    | 6%     | 11%    |\n| Annual turnover % men   | 11%    | 7%     | 12%    |\n\n## Employee Engagement Survey and turnover results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b9Our D&I Index measures core areas like how comfortable teammates feel sharing different opinions without fear of negative consequences, whether or not they feel they are being treated fairly, their impression of how well Bank of America has done in creating an environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed and how Bank of America values the unique experiences our teammates bring to the workplace.\n\n|",

We understand this may change based on severity  and location of future events. Refer to the Climate Risk Management  section on pages 120-121 of the 2021 Financial Review for further  details.

Evaluation of environmental matters may include land  and water use impacts, a remediation/reclamation track record  (if applicable), climate risk reporting, community and stakeholder  engagement and overall transparency. For acute physical risks, which  are extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes, or floods,  the Corporation follows Federal flood insurance regulations and the  industry's mortgage hazard insurance (including fire/wind coverage)  during underwriting. Flood insurance requirements are based on flood  zones determined by the FEMA. Insurance coverage amounts require  replacement value of property with policy parameters following  industry standards for minimum/maximum. |\n\n|                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                        | Prosperity                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Prosperity                   | Prosperity                   | Prosperity                   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| THEME                             | METRIC/QUESTION                                                                                                                                                                        | RESPONSE/FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                        | RESPONSE/FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT | RESPONSE/FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT | RESPONSE/FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT |\n| Employment and Wealth  Generation | Absolute number and rate of employment:  1.

Our  minimum hourly wage for U.S. teammates was raised to $21 in 2021,  building toward $25 per hour by 2025.  We compare our average U.S. hourly pay and benefits to living wage  standards utilizing MIT's Living Wage Calculator. The Living Wage  calculator is a market-based approach that measures the basic needs  of a family including items such as food, childcare, health insurance  and housing costs. We are above the living wage for a family of four in  all of our U.S. markets when we consider our average hourly pay plus  benefits in alignment with the living wage definition. |\n| Dignity and Equality             | Risk for incidents of child, forced or compulsory labor:  An  explanation of the operations and suppliers considered to have  significant risk for incidents of child labor, forced or compulsory  labor.

The ESG Information included in this report may consider broader definitions of materiality used by certain external frameworks and reporting guidelines. Accordingly, such ESG Information may not be considered material for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting purposes, and materiality and the use of the term 'material' in the context of these disclosures is distinct from such terms as defined for SEC reporting purposes. Any inclusion of ESG Information in this report in response to a metric or question referencing materiality is not an indication that the subject or information is material to Bank of America for SEC reporting purposes. Additionally, certain statements regarding Responsible Growth and ESG Information are not guarantees or promises that such metrics, goals or commitments will be met and are based on current goals, commitments, estimates, assumptions, developing standards and methodologies and currently available data, which continue to evolve and develop. Such ESG Information may also include the use of non-financial metrics that are subject to significant measurement uncertainties, which may include the methodology, collection and verification of data, various estimates and assumptions and/or underlying data that is obtained from third parties, some of which we cannot independently verify.\n\nCertain statements contained in this report may constitute 'forward-looking' statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including statements about our future financial performance and business, Responsible Growth and ESG Information, which may evolve over time. We use words such as 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'expects,' 'intends,' and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations, plans or forecasts, are not guarantees of future results or performance, involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and often beyond our control and are inherently uncertain. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the discussion on forward-looking statements included in the Financial Review section of this report as well as the uncertainties and risks discussed in our /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text Annual Report on Form /one.text/zero.text-K and subsequent SEC filings.",

Forward-looking statements often use words such as 'anticipates,' 'targets,' 'expects,' 'hopes,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'goals,' 'believes,' 'continue' and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as 'will,' 'may,' 'might,' 'should,' 'would' and 'could.' Forwardlooking statements represent the Corporation's current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation's control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.\n\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K: and in any of the Corporation's subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission Filings: the Corporation's potential judgments, orders, settlements, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, including as a result of our participation in and execution of government programs related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such as the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states; the possibility that the Corporation's future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation, and regulatory and government actions; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties involved in mortgage securitizations; the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation's exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, economic conditions, trade policies and tensions, including tariffs, and potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate and inflationary environment on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties, including the impact of supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and labor shortages on the economic recovery and our business; the Corporation's concentration of credit risk; the Corporation's ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding revenue, net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax\n\nrate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation's credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation's capital plans; the effect of changes in or interpretations of income tax laws and regulations; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives regulations and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and any similar or related rules and regulations; a failure or disruption in or breach of the Corporation's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns; the transition and physical impacts of climate change; our ability to achieve environmental, social and governance goals and commitments or the impact of any changes in the Corporation's sustainability strategy or commitments generally; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal government's debt limit or changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy; the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, including the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and/or global, financial market conditions and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects; the impact of natural disasters, extreme weather events, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forwardlooking statement was made.\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n## Business Overview\n\nThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company.

        "page_content": "banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) , Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had $3.2 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 208,000 employees.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets in the U.S., and we serve approximately 67 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,200 retail financial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, and leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with approximately 41 million active users, including approximately 33 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business households. Our GWIM businesses, with client balances of $3.8 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n## Capital Management\n\nOn February 2, 2022, the Corporation announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash common stock dividend of $0.21 per share, payable on March 25, 2022 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2022.\n\nFor more information on our capital resources and regulatory developments, see Capital Management on page 88.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic) has impacted the Corporation and may continue to do so, as uncertainty remains about the duration of the pandemic and the timing and strength of the global economic recovery. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we regularly evaluate protocols and processes in place to execute our business continuity plans. In conjunction with our efforts to support clients affected by the pandemic, we have cumulatively originated $35.4 billion in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with amounts outstanding of $4.7 billion and $22.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe future direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic worsens due to various factors,\n\nincluding through the spread of more easily communicable variants of COVID-19, such conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\nFor more information on how the risks related to the pandemic adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, see Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates\n\nSubject to the continued publication of certain nonrepresentative London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) benchmark settings based on a modified calculation (i.e., on a 'synthetic' basis), British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings ceased or became no longer representative of the underlying market the rates seek to measure (i.e., non-representative) immediately after December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023. Separately, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021 subject to certain regulatory-approved exceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance).\n\nAs a result, a major transition has been and continues to be in progress in the global financial markets with respect to the replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs). This is a complex process impacting a variety of our businesses and operations. IBORs have historically been used in many of the Corporation's products and contracts, including derivatives, consumer and commercial loans, mortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments. In response, the Corporation established an enterprise-wide IBOR transition program, with active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Management Risk Committee (MRC) and Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC). The program continues to drive the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, including updates to its operational models, systems and processes, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Corporation has transitioned or otherwise addressed IBOR-based products and contracts referencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative after December 31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked commercial loans, LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages, LIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer trading of certain USD LIBOR and other interest rate swaps, and related hedging",

        "page_content": "arrangements. Additionally, in accordance with the USD LIBOR Guidance, the Corporation has ceased entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to certain regulatory-approved exceptions.\n\nThe Corporation launched capabilities and services to support the issuance and trading in products indexed to various alternative reference rates (ARRs) and developed employee training programs as well as other internal and external sources of information on the various challenges and opportunities that the replacement of IBORs has presented and continues to present. The Corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones and access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products.\n\nWith respect to the transition of LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as of June 30, 2023, a significant majority of the Corporation's notional contractual exposure to such LIBOR currencies, of which the significant majority is derivatives contracts, have been remediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to ARRs based on market driven protocols, regulatory guidance and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms) and the Corporation is continuing to remediate the remaining USD LIBOR exposure. The remaining exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans and which represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation, will require active dialogue with clients to modify the contracts. For any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the Corporation is assessing and planning to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including relevant state legislation and any future federal legislation, to transition such exposure to ARRs.\n\nThe Corporation has implemented regulatory, tax and accounting changes and continues to monitor current and potential impacts of the transition, including Internal Revenue Service tax regulations and guidance and Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance. In addition, the Corporation has engaged impacted clients in connection with the transition by providing ARRs education and the timing of transition events. The Corporation is also working actively with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Changes to Overdraft Services\n\nIn January 2022, the Corporation announced changes to its overdraft services for consumer and small business clients, which include eliminating non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees beginning in February 2022 and reducing overdraft fees from $35 to $10 beginning in May 2022. Fees from overdraft services were approximately $1 billion in 2021 and recorded in Consumer Banking as service charges in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Due to the policy changes, in 2022 the Corporation expects a significant reduction in NSF and overdraft fees.\n\n## Financial Highlights\n\nTable 1 Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data\n\n| (Dollars in millions, except per share information)        | 2021      | 2020      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Income statement                                           |           |           |\n| Net interest income                                        | $ 42,934  | $ 43,360  |\n| Noninterest income                                         | 46,179    | 42,168    |\n| Total revenue, net of interest expense                     | 89,113    | 85,528    |\n| Provision for credit losses                                | (4,594)   | 11,320    |\n| Noninterest expense                                        | 59,731    | 55,213    |\n| Income before income taxes                                 | 33,976    | 18,995    |\n| Income tax expense                                         | 1,998     | 1,101     |\n| Net income                                                 | 31,978    | 17,894    |\n| Preferred stock dividends                                  | 1,421     | 1,421     |\n| Net income applicable to common shareholders               | $ 30,557  | $ 16,473  |\n| Per common share information                               |           |           |\n| Earnings                                                   | $ 3.60    | $ 1.88    |\n| Diluted earnings                                           | 3.57      | 1.87      |\n| Dividends paid                                             | 0.78      | 0.72      |\n| Performance ratios                                         |           |           |\n| Return on average assets (1)                               | 1.05 %    | 0.67 %    |\n| Return on average common shareholders' equity (1)          | 12.23     | 6.76      |\n| Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (2) | 17.02     | 9.48      |\n| Efficiency ratio (1)                                       | 67.03     | 64.55     |\n| Balance sheet at year end                                  |           |           |\n| Total loans and leases                                     | $ 979,124 | $ 927,861 |\n| Total assets                                               | 3,169,495 | 2,819,627 |\n| Total deposits                                             | 2,064,446 | 1,795,480 |\n| Total liabilities                                          | 2,899,429 | 2,546,703 |\n| Total common shareholders' equity                          | 245,358   | 248,414   |\n| Total shareholders' equity                                 | 270,066   | 272,924   |\n\nNet income was $32.0 billion or $3.57 per diluted share in 2021 compared to $17.9 billion or $1.87 per diluted share in 2020. The increase in net income was due to improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.\n\nFor discussion and analysis of our consolidated and business segment results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019, see the Financial Highlights and Business Segment Operations sections in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Net Interest Income\n\nNet interest income decreased $426 million to $42.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. Net interest yield on a fully taxableequivalent (FTE) basis decreased 24 basis points (bps) to 1.66 percent for 2021. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates and average loan balances, partially offset by higher average balances of debt securities.

The following highlights the significant changes.\n\n- \u25cf Card income increased $562 million primarily driven by increased client activity and merchant services revenue.\n- \u25cf Service charges increased $363 million primarily due to higher treasury and credit service charges and increased client activity.\n- \u25cf Investment and brokerage services increased $2.1 billion primarily driven by higher market valuations and assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing.\n- \u25cf Investment banking fees increased $1.7 billion primarily due to higher advisory fees as well as higher debt and equity issuance fees.\n- \u25cf Market making and similar activities increased $336 million primarily driven by strong sales and trading performance in Equities, partially offset by a weaker performance in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), which benefited from a more favorable market environment in 2020.\n- \u25cf Other income decreased $1.1 billion primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans in the prior year, as well as higher partnership losses on tax credit investments.\n\n## Provision for Credit Losses\n\nThe provision for credit losses improved $15.9 billion to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The benefit was primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 112.\n\n## Table 3 Noninterest Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                     | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Compensation and benefits                 | $ 36,140 | $ 32,725 |\n| Occupancy and equipment                   | 7,138    | 7,141    |\n| Information processing and communications | 5,769    | 5,222    |\n| Product delivery and transaction related  | 3,881    | 3,433    |\n| Marketing                                 | 1,939    | 1,701    |\n| Professional fees                         | 1,775    | 1,694    |\n| Other general operating                   | 3,089    | 3,297    |\n| Total noninterest expense                 | $ 59,731 | $ 55,213 |\n\nNoninterest expense increased $4.5 billion to $59.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, higher costs associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits, a contribution to the Bank of America Foundation and an impairment charge for real estate rationalization.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)      | 2021     | 2020     |\n|----------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Income before income taxes | $ 33,976 | $ 18,995 |\n| Income tax expense         | 1,998    | 1,101    |\n| Effective tax rate         | 5.9 %    | 5.8 %    |\n\nIncome tax expense was $2.0 billion for 2021 compared to $1.1 billion in 2020, resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9 percent compared to 5.8 percent.\n\nThe effective tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits and positive income tax adjustments from the impact of U.K. tax law changes discussed below. Our recurring tax preference benefits primarily consist of tax credits from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments in affordable housing and renewable energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability challenges. Absent these tax credits, the impact of the U.K. tax law changes and other discrete items, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 25 percent and 26 percent for 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn June 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which included an increase in the U.K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings. In addition, in July 2020, the U.K. enacted a repeal of the final two percent of scheduled decreases in the U.K. corporation income tax rate. As a result, in 2021 and 2020, the Corporation recorded write-ups of U.K. net deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion and $700 million, with corresponding positive income tax adjustments. These write-ups were reversals of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation income tax rate.",

The increase in assets was primarily due to higher debt securities that were primarily funded by deposit growth, an increase in loans and leases and higher trading account assets, partially offset by lower federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $32.2 billion primarily driven by higher investments in debt securities .\n\n## Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\n\nFederal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral. Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell decreased $53.3 billion primarily due to the investment of excess cash into debt securities.\n\n## Trading Account Assets\n\nTrading account assets consist primarily of long positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account assets increased $48.2 billion primarily due to an increase in inventory within Global Markets .\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nDebt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to leverage market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments. Debt securities increased $297.8 billion primarily driven by the deployment of deposit inflows. For more information on debt\n\nsecurities, see Note 4 -Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans and leases increased $51.3 billion primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and higher securities-based lending within consumer loans. For more information on the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 98.\n\n## Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $6.4 billion primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 112.\n\n## All Other Assets\n\nAll other assets increased $31.8 billion primarily driven by higher margin loans and loans held-for-sale (LHFS).\n\n## Liabilities\n\nAt December 31, 2021, total liabilities were approximately $2.9 trillion, up $352.7 billion from December 31, 2020, primarily due to deposit growth.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits increased $269.0 billion primarily due to an increase in retail and wholesale deposits.\n\n## Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n\nFederal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $22.0 billion primarily driven by client activity within Global Markets .\n\n## Trading Account Liabilities\n\nTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. Treasury and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign",

        "page_content": "debt. Trading account liabilities increased $29.4 billion primarily due to higher levels of short positions within Global Markets .\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less. Short-term borrowings increased $4.4 billion primarily due to an increase in short-term commercial paper issuances to manage liquidity needs. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10 -Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt increased $17.2 billion primarily due to debt issuances, partially offset by maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments. For more information on long-term debt, see Note 11 -Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nShareholders' equity decreased $2.9 billion primarily due to returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities and the redemption of preferred stock, partially offset by net income.\n\n## Cash Flows Overview\n\nThe Corporation's operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements, long-term debt and common and preferred stock. For more information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 93.\n\n## Supplemental Financial Data\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from\n\nboth taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ('adjusted' shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.\n- \u25cf Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.\n- \u25cf Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 124.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 208.\n\nOur consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 67, Table 6 on page 71 and Table 7 on page 72.\n\nFor information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 75.",

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 85. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 -Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 70,\n\nand for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and year-end total assets, see Note 23 -Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nEffective October 1, 2021, a business activity previously included in Global Markets is being reported as a liquidating business in All Other , consistent with a realignment in performance reporting to senior management. The activity was not material to Global Markets' results of operations and historical results have not been restated. For more information, see Note 23 -Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments' operational performance, customer trends and business growth.",

Deposits and Consumer Lending include the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM , as well as other client-managed businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coastto-coast network including financial centers in 38 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2021, our network includes approximately 4,200 financial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading digital banking platforms with more than 41 million active users, including approximately 33 million active mobile users .\n\n## Consumer Banking Results\n\nNet income for Consumer Banking increased $5.4 billion to $11.9 billion primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $231 million to $24.9 billion primarily due to the benefit of higher\n\ndeposit balances and the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by lower interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest income increased $512 million to $9.1 billion primarily driven by higher card income and service charges due to increased client activity, partially offset by the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results.\n\nThe provision for credit losses improved $6.8 billion to a benefit of $1.0 billion primarily driven by reserve releases due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. Noninterest expense increased $408 million to $19.3 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation, cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, including the merchant services platform, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital was 31 percent, up from 17 percent, driven by higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 75.",

Our deposit products include noninterestand interest-bearing checking accounts, money market savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, as well as investment accounts and products. Net interest income is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, nonsufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Consumer Investment accounts. Consumer Investments serves investment client relationships through the Merrill Edge integrated investing and banking service platform, providing investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, self-directed online investing and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation's network of financial centers and ATMs.\n\nNet income for Deposits increased $483 million to $4.7 billion due to higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $619 million to $14.4 billion primarily due to the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $24 million to $3.7 billion primarily driven by higher service charges and investment and brokerage fees, largely offset by the allocation of ALM results.\n\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $139 million to $240 million due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $142 million to $11.7 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, and the cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs.\n\nAverage deposits increased $159.1 billion to $976.1 billion primarily due to net inflows of $90.4 billion in checking and time deposits and $68.0 billion in traditional savings and money market savings driven by strong organic growth and government stimulus measures.\n\nThe table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/ mobile trends.\n\n## Key Statistics -Deposits\n\n|                                                        | 2021     | 2020     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Total deposit spreads (excludes noninterest costs) (1) | 1.69%    | 1.94%    |\n| Year End                                               |          |          |\n| Consumer investment assets (in millions) (2)           | $368,831 | $306,104 |\n| Active digital banking users (in thousands) (3)        | 41,365   | 39,315   |\n| Active mobile banking users (in thousands) (4)         | 32,980   | 30,783   |\n| Financial centers                                      | 4,173    | 4,312    |\n| ATMs                                                   | 16,209   | 16,904   |\n\nConsumer investment assets increased $62.7 billion to $368.8 billion driven by market performance and client flows. Active mobile banking users increased approximately two million, reflecting continuing changes in our customers' banking preferences. We had a net decrease of 139 financial centers as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network.\n\n## Consumer Lending\n\nConsumer Lending offers products to consumers and small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include debit and credit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from debit and credit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans, including loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.",

Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equitylinked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, MBS, commodities and assetbacked securities. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . For information on\n\ninvestment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 82.\n\nThe following explanations for year-over-year changes for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 70.\n\nNet income for Global Markets decreased $695 million to $4.6 billion. Net DVA losses were $54 million compared to losses of $133 million in 2020. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $755 million to $4.6 billion. These decreases were primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses.\n\nRevenue increased $490 million to $19.3 billion primarily driven by higher investment banking fees and sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $172 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $93 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in Equities, partially offset by lower revenue in FICC.\n\nThe provision for credit losses decreased $186 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.6 billion to $13.0 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses for sales and trading as well as costs associated with processing",

Year-end total assets increased $131.2 billion to $747.8 billion. Both increases were primarily due to higher client balances in Equities and higher levels of inventory and loan growth in FICC.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital was 12 percent, down from 15 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 75.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\nSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets which are included in market making and similar activities, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixedincome (government debt obligations, investment and noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity).

For more information on U.K. tax law changes, see Financial Highlights -Income Tax Expense on page 68. Both years included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking .\n\n## Managing Risk\n\nRisk is inherent in all our business activities. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nThe seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational.\n\n- \u25cf Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate.\n- \u25cf Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.\n- \u25cf Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings. Market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk.\n- \u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions.\n- \u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures.\n- \u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people or external events.\n- \u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.\n\nThe following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current\n\nRisk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board.\n\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how we drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success of the Corporation and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the Board.\n\nOur Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.\n\nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and recommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. Management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. Capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. For more information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 75.\n\nThe Corporation's risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. Our risk appetite provides a common set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing to take in alignment with our strategic and capital plans and ensure that the Corporation's risk profile remains aligned with our risk appetite. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits.\n\nOur overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner, including during periods of stress.\n\nOur lines of business operate with risk limits (which may include credit, market and/or operational limits, as applicable) that align with the Corporation's risk appetite. Executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversee financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 88 through 121.\n\nFor more information about the Corporation's risks related to the pandemic, see Item 1A.

These COVID-19 related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs.\n\n## Risk Management Governance\n\nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the Board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers. Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval\n\nfunctions, which may be evidenced in documents such as committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the Board, Board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board of Directors and Board Committees\n\nThe Board is composed of 16 directors, all but one of whom are independent. The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective Risk Framework and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk Management (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee executive management addressing key risks we face. Other Board committees, as described below, provide additional oversight of specific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the Board on risk-related matters within the committee's responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and independence of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of management or the Chief Audit Executive (CAE) to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Committee\n\nThe ERC has primary responsibility for oversight of the Risk\n\nFramework and key risks we face and of the Corporation's overall risk appetite. It approves the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Statement and further recommends these documents to the Board for approval. The ERC oversees senior management's responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks we face. The ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related matters.\n\n## Other Board Committees\n\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee oversees our Board's governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, recommends nominees for election to our Board, recommends committee appointments for Board approval and reviews our ESG and stockholder engagement activities.\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer's (CEO) compensation to our Board for further approval by all independent directors; reviewing and approving our executive officers' compensation, as well as compensation for non-management directors; and reviewing certain other human capital management topics.\n\n## Management Committees\n\nManagement committees receive their authority from the Board, a Board committee, another management committee or from one or more executive officers. Our primary management risk committee is the MRC. Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the Corporation, including an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity.\n\n## Lines of Defense\n\nWe have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and",

        "page_content": "Corporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure. Each of these functional roles is further described in this section.\n\n## Executive Officers\n\nExecutive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the Board, Board committees or management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with our Risk Framework, risk appetite, and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies and standards. Executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. Executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions.\n\n## Front Line Units\n\nFLUs, which include the lines of business as well as Global Technology and Global Operations, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities.\n\nThree organizational units that include FLU activities and control function activities, but are not part of GRM are first, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Group; second, the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Group; and third, Global Strategy and Enterprise Platforms (GSEP).\n\n## Global Risk Management\n\nGRM is part of our control functions and operates as our independent risk management function. GRM, led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions. GRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures outlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled.\n\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing risk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to both the ERC and the CEO. GRM is organized into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function. These teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.\n\n## Corporate Audit\n\nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from the FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee. The CAE administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the Corporation's credit platform through examinations and monitoring.\n\n## Risk Management Processes\n\nThe Risk Framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business processes\n\nacross the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We employ an effective risk management process, referred to as Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily activities.\n\nIdentify -To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively identified and well understood. Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors. Each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing process that incorporates input from FLUs and control functions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.\n\nMeasure -Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic process including quantitative and qualitative components. Risk is measured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU and legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis. This risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.\n\nMonitor -We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies and standards. We also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the Board (directly or through an appropriate committee).\n\nControl -We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes. The limits and controls can be adjusted by the Board or management when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories). Our FLUs are held accountable for performing within the established limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities. Establishing a culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers' financial lives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical to effective risk management. We are committed to the highest principles of ethical and professional conduct. Conduct risk is the risk of improper actions, behaviors or practices that are illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in harm to the Corporation, our shareholders or our customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively impact our reputation. We have established protocols and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across the Corporation appropriately. All employees are held accountable for adhering to the Code of Conduct, operating within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business activities. In addition, our performance management and compensation practices encourage responsible risk-taking that is consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite.",

        "page_content": "## Corporation-wide Stress Testing\n\nIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. The intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and certain subsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency, which provides confidence to management, regulators and our investors.\n\n## Contingency Planning\n\nWe have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These contingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan and Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, or other derisking strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America.\n\n## Strategic Risk Management\n\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, executive management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services\n\nand other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions.\n\n## Capital Management\n\nThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.\n\nWe conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forwardlooking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees.\n\nWe periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For more information, see Business Segment Operations on page 75.\n\n## CCAR and Capital Planning\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2021 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests, we are subject to a 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB), unchanged from the prior level, effective October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.\n\nDue to uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve imposed various restrictions on share repurchase programs and dividends during 2020 and the first half of 2021.",

        "page_content": "In conjunction with its release of 2021 CCAR supervisory stress test results, the Federal Reserve announced those restrictions would end as of July 1, 2021 for large banks, including the Corporation, and large banks would be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve's SCB framework. On October 20, 2021, we announced that the Board renewed the Corporation's $25 billion common stock repurchase program previously announced in April 2021. The Board's authorization replaced the previous program. As with the April authorization, the Board also authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation's equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board's authorization, during 2021 we repurchased $25.1 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equitybased compensation plans.\n\nThe timing and amount of common stock repurchases made pursuant to our stock repurchase program are subject to various factors, including the Corporation's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).\n\n## Regulatory Capital\n\nAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of December 31, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach.\n\n## Minimum Capital Requirements\n\nIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet riskbased capital ratio requirements that include a capital\n\nconservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. Including a regulatory minimum requirement of 4.5 percent, an SCB of 2.5 percent and a G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent, the Corporation's CET1 capital ratio must be a minimum of 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee's assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation's reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation's G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024 unless its surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2022 is lower than 3.0 percent.\n\nThe current SCB of 2.5 percent, which remains effective from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, could change based on results of the 2022 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests to be submitted in the first half of 2022.\n\nThe Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. The temporary exclusions expired after March 31, 2021 and were not applicable for December 31, 2021. For more information, see Capital Management -Regulatory Developments on page 93.\n\n## Capital Composition and Ratios\n\nTable 10 presents Bank of America Corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2021 and 2020. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.",

Tier 1 capital decreased $3.6 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital, partially offset by non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances. Total capital under the Standardized approach decreased $10.3 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the decrease in CET1 capital, and a decrease in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital. RWA under the\n\nStandardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at December 31, 2021, increased $138.1 billion during 2021 to $1,618 billion primarily due to loan growth in Global Banking, strong client activity in Global Markets and an increase in debt securities resulting from the deployment of cash received from deposit inflows. Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2021 increased $818.1 billion during 2021 primarily due to the expiration of the Federal Reserve's temporary relief to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and an increase in debt securities resulting from the deployment of cash received from deposit inflows.\n\n7.4\n\n%\n\n4.0\n\n200,096\n\n227,685\n\n1,371\n\n12.9\n\n%\n\n14.6\n\n16.6\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n$\n\n176,660\n\n$\n\n2,719\n\n7.4\n\n%\n\n200,096\n\n237,936\n\n1,480\n\n11.9\n\n%\n\n13.5\n\n16.1\n\n9.5\n\n%\n\n11.0\n\n13.0",

These temporary changes to the SLR allowed the exclusion of on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of supplementary leverage exposure. While the temporary relief automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation's lead depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the OCC. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation's SLR was 5.5 percent, which exceeds the 5.0 percent minimum required by the Federal Reserve.\n\n## Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation\n\nThe Corporation's principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).\n\nThe U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. brokerdealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its\n\ncustomers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At December 31, 2021, BofAS had tentative net capital of $19.4 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $16.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $3.5 billion.\n\nMLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At December 31, 2021, MLPCC's regulatory net capital of $6.2 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion.\n\nMLPF&S provides retail services. At December 31, 2021, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $5.7 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $199 million.\n\nOur European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2021, MLI's capital resources were $33.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.0 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution and the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2021, BofASE's capital resources were $7.9 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $2.8 billion.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\n## Funding and Liquidity Risk Management\n\nOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the pandemic. For more information on the risks of the pandemic, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Executive Summary -Recent Developments -COVID-19",

        "page_content": "Pandemic on page 66.\n\nWe define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.\n\nThe Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan. The ERC establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels. The MRC is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels. The MRC reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results, approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 85. Under this governance framework, we developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.\n\n## NB Holdings Corporation\n\nThe parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional parent company assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nIn consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service nearterm cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent.\n\n## Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\n\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and other investmentgrade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.\n\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nTable 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources\n\n|                                        | Three Months Ended December 31   | Three Months Ended December 31   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in billions)                  | 2021                             | 2020                             |\n| Bank entities                          | $ 1,006                          | $ 773                            |\n| Nonbank and other entities (1)         | 152                              | 170                              |\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 1,158                          | $ 943                            |\n\nOur bank subsidiaries' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $322 billion and $306 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.\n\nLiquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. Parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.",

However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $617 billion and $584 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 115 percent and 122 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.\n\n## Liquidity Stress Analysis\n\nWe utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.\n\nThe types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.\n\nWe consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule\n\nOn October 20, 2020, U.S. banking regulators finalized the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule was effective July 1, 2021, and the Corporation is in compliance. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. There have not been any significant impacts to the Corporation.\n\n## Diversified Funding Sources\n\nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.\n\nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\n\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $2.1 trillion and $1.8 trillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking , GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.\n\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 -Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTotal long-term debt increased $17.2 billion to $280.1 billion during 2021, primarily due to debt issuances, partially offset by debt maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated",

        "page_content": "entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.\n\nDuring 2021, we issued $76.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $56.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $8.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $12.5 billion of other debt. During 2020, we issued $56.9 billion of long-term debt consisting of $43.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant, $4.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $8.3 billion of other debt.\n\nDuring 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of $24.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.4 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $11.6 billion of other debt. During 2020, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $47.1 billion consisting of $22.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $11.5 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $13.0 billion of other debt.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Bank of America Corporation's senior notes of $212.9 billion included $179.5 billion of outstanding notes that are both TLAC eligible and callable at least one year before their stated maturities. Of these senior notes, $15.0 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible during 2022, and $17.0 billion, $17.8 billion, $15.0 billion and $17.7 billion will do so during each of 2023 through 2026, respectively, and $97.0 billion thereafter.\n\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLACeligible debt. During 2021, we issued $7.1 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 -Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 118.\n\n## Uninsured Deposits\n\nThe FDIC insures the Corporation's U.S. deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category, and various country-specific funds insure non-U.S. deposits up to specified limits. Deposits that exceed insurance limits are uninsured. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation's deposits totaled $2.1 trillion, of which total estimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were $701.4 billion and $111.9 billion. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation's deposits totaled $1.8 trillion, of which total estimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were $597.7 billion and $104.1 billion.\n\nTable 17 presents information about the Corporation's total estimated uninsured time deposits. For more information on our liquidity sources, see Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets, and for more information on deposits, see Diversified Funding Sources in this section.

These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.\n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review",

The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.\n\nOther factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies' views on whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.\n\nOn May 24, 2021, Standard & Poor's Global Ratings (S&P) affirmed the current ratings of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, while at the same time revising its rating outlook to Positive from Stable.\n\nOn June 7, 2021, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) upgraded the longterm senior debt ratings of the Corporation and its rated subsidiaries by one notch, to AA- and AA, respectively. Fitch also upgraded the Corporation's short-term rating to F1+ which is now aligned with the short-term rating of its subsidiaries, including BANA. Following the upgrade, the rating outlook for the Corporation and its subsidiaries is Stable.\n\nOn November 22, 2021, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) affirmed the current ratings of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, while at the same time revising its rating outlook to Positive from Stable.\n\nTable 18 presents the Corporation's current long-term/shortterm senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.\n\nTable 18 Senior Debt Ratings\n\n|                                                    | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                    | Long-term                   | Short-term                  | Outlook                     | Long-term                          | Short-term                         | Outlook                            | Long-term       | Short-term      | Outlook         |\n| Bank of America Corporation                        | A2                          | P-1                         | Positive                    | A-                                 | A-2                                | Positive                           | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Bank of America, N.A.                              | Aa2                         | P-1                         | Positive                    | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Bank of America Europe Designated Activity Company | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities, Inc.                              | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch International                        | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities Europe SA                          | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Positive                           | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n\nA reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or brokerdealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk -Liquidity Stress Analysis on page 95.\n\nFor more information on additional collateral and termination\n\npayments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 -Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A.

The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts), is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Securities) or capital securities (the Capital Securities and, together with the Guaranteed Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities, the Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that remained outstanding at December 31, 2021.

No other subsidiary of the Corporation guarantees the Guaranteed Securities.\n\nBofA Finance and each of the Trusts are finance subsidiaries, have no independent assets, revenues or operations and are dependent upon the Corporation and/or the Corporation's other subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations under the Guaranteed Securities in the ordinary course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on their Guaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, any recoveries on those claims will be limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the Corporation, as described above.\n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for liquidity. Applicable laws and regulations and intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the Corporation's resolution plan could restrict the availability of funds from subsidiaries to the Corporation, which could adversely affect the Corporation's ability to make payments under its guarantees. In addition, the obligations of the Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to assets of the Corporation for payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, under the indenture governing the Guaranteed Notes, the subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to assume the Corporation's obligations under its guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes.\n\nFor more information on factors that may affect payments to holders of the Guaranteed Securities, see Liquidity Risk -NB Holdings Corporation in this section, Item 1. Business of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations\n\nFor information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 -Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets heldfor-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets heldfor-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair\n\nvalue adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 3 -Derivatives and Note 12 -Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.\n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories .\n\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 104, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 110, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 112, and Note 5 -Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the factors that may expose us to credit risk, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDuring 2021, the economy gained momentum as unemployment continued to decline from double-digit highs during 2020 and the economy re-opened as vaccination rates increased and restrictions eased. With the easing of restrictions, we saw increased business openings, a rebound to commercial and consumer spending, higher asset values and increased global GDP, all of which positively impacted our consumer and commercial credit portfolios. Additionally, individuals and businesses in the U.S. benefited from various forms of government support through economic stimulus packages enacted in 2020 and 2021, which contributed to strong asset quality across our credit portfolios.\n\nAs a result of the economic recovery experienced in 2021, net charge-offs, nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized exposure declined compared to 2020. While there has been significant economic improvement in comparison to 2020, uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the economy's recovery, which may also be hampered by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. The pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. While COVID-19 cases eased throughout the majority of 2021, they reached new highs by the end of 2021, and the spread of new, more contagious variants could impact the magnitude and duration of this health crisis.

Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.\n\n## Consumer Credit Portfolio\n\nThe economic environment improved during 2021, with the U.S. unemployment rate continuing to decline and home prices increasing. During 2021, net charge-offs decreased $805 million to $1.8 billion primarily due to lower credit card losses, as the impact of government stimulus measures were partially offset by charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. During 2021, nonperforming loans increased due to deferral activity.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $3.0 billion in 2021 to $7.0 billion primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.

        "page_content": "We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.\n\n## Residential Mortgage\n\nThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 51 percent of consumer loans and leases in 2021. Approximately 52 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking\n\nand 43 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other .\n\nOutstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $1.6 billion in 2021 as paydowns were partially offset by originations.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the residential mortgage portfolio included $12.7 billion and $11.8 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements.\n\nTable 21 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fullyinsured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.\n\n## Table 21 Residential Mortgage -Key Credit Statistics\n\nTable 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long BeachSanta Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 15 percent and 16 percent of outstandings at December 31, 2021 and 2020. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n|                                                             | Reported Basis (1)   | Reported Basis (1)   | Excluding Fully-insured Loans (1)   | Excluding Fully-insured Loans (1)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | December 31          | December 31          | December 31                         | December 31                         |\n| (Dollars in millions)                                       | 2021                 | 2020                 | 2021                                | 2020                                |\n| Outstandings                                                | $ 221,963            | $ 223,555            | $ 209,259                           | $ 211,737                           |\n| Accruing past due 30 days or more                           | 1,753                | 2,314                | 866                                 | 1,224                               |\n| Accruing past due 90 days or more                           | 634                  | 762                  | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Nonperforming loans (2)                                     | 2,284                | 2,005                | 2,284                               | 2,005                               |\n| Percent of portfolio                                        |                      |                      |                                     |                                     |\n| Refreshed LTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 | 1%                   | 2 %                  | 1%                                  | 1 %                                 |\n| Refreshed LTV greater than 100                              | -                    | 1                    | -                                   | 1                                   |\n| Refreshed FICO below 620                                    | 2                    | 2                    | 1                                   | 1                                   |\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $279 million in 2021 primarily driven by deferral activity. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2021, $1.2 billion, or 51 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $358 million driven by continued improvement in credit quality.\n\nNet recoveries of $28 million in 2021 remained relatively unchanged compared to 2020.\n\nOf the $209.3 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2021, 27 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $4.8 billion, or eight percent, at December 31, 2021. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2021, $66 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $866 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential\n\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2021, $275 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $83 million were contractually current compared to $2.3 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 91 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later.",

HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 11 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $6.4 billion in 2021 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new\n\noriginations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, $12.2 billion, or 44 percent, and $13.8 billion, or 40 percent, were in first-lien positions. At December 31, 2021, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more juniorlien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.6 billion, or 16 percent of our total home equity portfolio.\n\nUnused HELOCs totaled $40.5 billion and $42.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The HELOC utilization rate was 39 percent and 43 percent at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nTable 23 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics.\n\n|                                                              | December 31   | December 31   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                        | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Outstandings                                                 | $ 27,935      | $ 34,311      |\n| Accruing past due 30 days or more                            | 157           | 186           |\n| Nonperforming loans (2)                                      | 630           | 649           |\n| Percent of portfolio                                         |               |               |\n| Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 | -%            | 1 %           |\n| Refreshed CLTV greater than 100                              | 1             | 1             |\n| Refreshed FICO below 620                                     | 3             | 3             |\n\nNonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio remained relatively flat at $630 million at December 31, 2021. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2021, $227 million, or 36 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $273 million, or 43 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $29 million in 2021.\n\nNet recoveries increased $46 million to $119 million in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices.\n\nOf the $27.9 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2021, as shown in Table 23, 14 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $6.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when\n\ncompared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2021, $105 million, or two percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2021, $455 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.\n\nAlthough we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During 2021, nine percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.",

Outstandings in the credit card portfolio increased $2.7 billion in 2021 to $81.4 billion due to higher retail spend. Net chargeoffs decreased $626 million to $1.7 billion during 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to the impact of government stimulus measures, partially offset by charge-offs of certain loans with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card\n\nloans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $692 million, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $416 million primarily due to charge-offs of certain loans with deferrals that expired in 2020 and the impact of government stimulus measures.\n\nUnused lines of credit for credit card increased to $361.2 billion at December 31, 2021 from $342.4 billion at 2020.\n\nTable 25 presents certain state concentrations for the credit card portfolio.\n\n|                             | Outstandings   | Outstandings   | Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More (1)   | Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More (1)   |                 |                 |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                             | December 31    | December 31    | December 31                             | December 31                             | Net Charge-offs | Net Charge-offs |\n| (Dollars in millions)       | 2021           | 2020           | 2021                                    | 2020                                    | 2021            | 2020            |\n| California                  | $ 13,076       | $ 12,543       | $ 82                                    | $ 166                                   | $ 322           | $ 419           |\n| Florida                     | 8,046          | 7,666          | 71                                      | 135                                     | 245             | 306             |\n| Texas                       | 6,894          | 6,499          | 47                                      | 87                                      | 158             | 202             |\n| New York                    | 4,725          | 4,654          | 35                                      | 76                                      | 135             | 188             |\n| Washington                  | 4,080          | 3,685          | 13                                      | 21                                      | 39              | 56              |\n| Other                       | 44,617         | 43,661         | 239                                     | 418                                     | 824             | 1,178           |\n| Total credit card portfolio | $ 81,438       | $ 78,708       | $ 487                                   | $ 903                                   | $ 1,723         | $ 2,349         |\n\n## Direct/Indirect Consumer\n\nAt December 31, 2021, 47 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 53 percent was included in\n\nGWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased by $12.2 billion in 2021 to $103.6 billion driven by client demand for liquidity and high asset values in the securities-based lending portfolio.",

During 2021, nonperforming consumer loans increased $264 million to $3.0 billion primarily driven by consumer real estate deferral activity.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, $888 million, or 30 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs\n\nto sell. In addition, at December 31, 2021, $1.4 billion, or 48 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.\n\nForeclosed properties decreased $22 million in 2021 to $101 million. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                                                                              | 2021    | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1                                                                                                          | $ 2,725 | $ 2,053 |\n| Additions                                                                                                                                          | 2,006   | 2,278   |\n| Reductions:                                                                                                                                        |         |         |\n| Paydowns and payoffs                                                                                                                               | (625)   | (440)   |\n| Sales                                                                                                                                              | (4)     | (38)    |\n| Returns to performing status (1)                                                                                                                   | (1,037) | (1,014) |\n| Charge-offs                                                                                                                                        | (64)    | (78)    |\n| Transfers to foreclosed properties                                                                                                                 | (12)    | (36)    |\n| Total net additions to nonperforming loans and leases                                                                                              | 264     | 672     |\n| Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 31                                                                                                  | 2,989   | 2,725   |\n| Foreclosed properties, December 31 (2)                                                                                                             | 101     | 123     |\n| Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, December 31                                                                        | $ 3,090 | $ 2,848 |\n| Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (3)                                               | 0.69 %  | 0.64 %  |\n| Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (3) | 0.71    | 0.66    |",

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $672 million and $701 million, of which $599 million and $614 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms.\n\n## Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\n## Management of Commercial Credit Risk\n\n## Concentrations\n\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product,\n\ngeography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management -Industry Concentrations on page 108 and Table 36.\n\nWe account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\nIn addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a prorata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. For more information, see Note 12 -Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Credit Portfolio\n\nDuring 2021, commercial credit quality improved as the economic recovery gained momentum driven in part by increased consumer spending and COVID-19 vaccination progress. Accordingly, charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $44.4 billion during 2021 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Markets with most of the increase in investment grade exposures. This increase was partially offset by lower U.S. small business commercial loans due to repayments of PPP loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program.

However, certain sectors, including hospitality, while showing signs of improvement, continue to be negatively impacted due to the pandemic. Moreover, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties. Current and future office demand is uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.\n\nThe commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $3.4 billion during 2021 to $5.4 billion driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 112.\n\nTotal commercial utilized credit exposure increased $33.2 billion during 2021 to $653.5 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent at December 31, 2021 and 57 percent at December 31, 2020.\n\nTable 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.\n\n## Table 29 Commercial Credit Exposure by Type\n\n(1)\n\n(2,\n\n3,\n\n4)\n\nTable 30 Commercial Credit Quality\n\n|                                                    | Commercial Utilized   | Commercial Utilized   | Commercial Unfunded December 31   | Commercial Unfunded December 31   | Total Commercial Committed   | Total Commercial Committed   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                              | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2021                              | 2020                              | 2021                         | 2020                         |\n| Loans and leases                                   | $ 543,420             | $ 499,065             | $ 454,256                         | $ 404,740                         | $ 997,676                    | $ 903,805                    |\n| Derivative assets (5)                              | 35,344                | 47,179                | -                                 | -                                 | 35,344                       | 47,179                       |\n| Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees | 34,389                | 34,616                | 639                               | 538                               | 35,028                       | 35,154                       |\n| Debt securities and other investments              | 19,427                | 22,618                | 4,638                             | 4,827                             | 24,065                       | 27,445                       |\n| Loans held-for-sale                                | 13,185                | 8,378                 | 16,581                            | 9,556                             | 29,766                       | 17,934                       |\n| Operating leases                                   | 5,935                 | 6,424                 | -                                 | -                                 | 5,935                        | 6,424                        |\n| Commercial letters of credit                       | 1,176                 | 855                   | 247                               | 280                               | 1,423                        | 1,135                        |\n| Other                                              | 652                   | 1,168                 | -                                 | -                                 | 652                          | 1,168                        |\n| Total                                              | $ 653,528             | $ 620,303             | $ 476,361                         | $ 419,941                         | $ 1,129,889                  | $ 1,040,244                  |\n\nNonperforming commercial loans decreased $649 million.

U.S. commercial loans increased $37.2 billion, or 13 percent, during 2021 primarily driven by Global Markets and Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $10.1 billion, driven by decreases across a broad range of industries.\n\n## Non-U.S. Commercial\n\nAt December 31, 2021, 69 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 30 percent in Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $22.8 billion, or 25 percent, during 2021 primarily in Global Markets . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $2.5 billion, which was broad-based across industries. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 110.\n\n## Commercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $2.6 billion, or four percent, during 2021 to $63.0 billion due to new originations outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 21 percent and 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in certain geographic regions and property types of the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.",

The decline of $18.0 billion in PPP loans during 2021 was due to repayment of the loans by the SBA under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 and represented 95 percent of net charge-offs in 2021 compared to 91 percent in 2020.\n\n## Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity\n\nTable 34 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2021 and 2020. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During 2021, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $649 million to $1.6 billion. At December 31, 2021, 88 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 54 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 90 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                                                                                  | 2021    | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1                                                                                                              | $ 2,227 | $ 1,499 |\n| Additions                                                                                                                                              | 1,622   | 3,518   |\n| Reductions:                                                                                                                                            |         |         |\n| Paydowns                                                                                                                                               | (1,163) | (1,002) |\n| Sales                                                                                                                                                  | (199)   | (350)   |\n| Returns to performing status (3)                                                                                                                       | (264)   | (172)   |\n| Charge-offs                                                                                                                                            | (254)   | (1,208) |\n| Transfers to foreclosed properties                                                                                                                     | -       | (2)     |\n| Transfers to loans held-for-sale                                                                                                                       | (391)   | (56)    |\n| Total net additions (reductions) to nonperforming loans and leases                                                                                     | (649)   | 728     |\n| Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 31                                                                                                      | 1,578   | 2,227   |\n| Foreclosed properties, December 31                                                                                                                     | 29      | 41      |\n| Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, December 31                                                                          | $ 1,607 | $ 2,268 |\n| Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases (4)                                               | 0.29 %  | 0.45 %  |\n| Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties (4) | 0.30    | 0.46    |",

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $89.6 billion, or nine percent, during 2021 to $1.1 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Asset managers and funds, Finance companies and Utilities industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Government and public education and Automobiles and components industry sectors.\n\nIndustry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is determined on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $136.9 billion, increased $36.6 billion, or 37 percent, during 2021, which was primarily driven by secured investment grade exposures.\n\nReal estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $96.2 billion, increased $4.5 billion, or five percent, during 2021. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management -Commercial Real Estate on page 106.\n\nFinance companies, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $86.0 billion, increased $16.0 billion, or 23 percent during 2021, with the growth largely occurring in Consumer Finance, Thrifts and Mortgage Finance and Diversified Financials.\n\nGiven the widespread impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries have been and will likely continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.",

to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $2.6 billion and $4.2 billion. We recorded net losses of $91 million in 2021 compared to net losses of $240 million in 2020. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-atRisk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 43. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 115.\n\nTables 37 and 38 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Table 37 Net Credit Default Protection by Maturity\n\n|                                                            | December 31   | December 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                            | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Less than or equal to one year                             | 34 %          | 65 %          |\n| Greater than one year and less than or equal to five years | 62            | 34            |\n| Greater than five years                                    | 4             | 1             |\n| Total net credit default protection                        | 100 %         | 100 %         |\n\n|                                     | Net Notional (1)   | Percent of Total   | Net Notional (1)   | Percent of Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                     | December 31        | December 31        | December 31        | December 31        |\n| (Dollars in millions)               | 2021               | 2021               | 2020               | 2020               |\n| Ratings (2, 3)                      |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| A                                   | $ (350)            | 13.4 %             | $ (250)            | 6.0 %              |\n| BBB                                 | (710)              | 27.1               | (1,856)            | 44.5               |\n| BB                                  | (809)              | 30.9               | (1,363)            | 32.7               |\n| B                                   | (659)              | 25.2               | (465)              | 11.2               |\n| CCC and below                       | (35)               | 1.3                | (182)              | 4.4                |\n| NR (4)                              | (55)               | 2.1                | (54)               | 1.2                |\n| Total net credit default protection | $ (2,618)          | 100.0 %            | $ (4,170)          | 100.0 %            |",

        "page_content": "In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including brokerdealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see Note 3 -Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\n## Non-U.S. Portfolio\n\nOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and\n\nmanage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance.\n\nTable 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at December 31, 2021. These exposures accounted for 89 percent and 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $10.5 billion in 2021 primarily driven by increases in Australia, Canada and France, partially offset by reductions in Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nNon-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S.\n\nFunded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.\n\nIncrease\n\nTable 39 Top 20 Non-U.S. Countries

Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $33.8 billion at December 31, 2021, a $11.1 billion decrease from December 31, 2020. The decrease in both of these countries was primarily driven by a reduction in deposits with central banks.\n\nIn light of the global pandemic, we are monitoring our nonU.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will likely continue to adversely affect economic activity.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time.

This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 118.\n\nWe have been affected, and may continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information, see Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOur traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section.\n\nGlobal Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Given that models are used across the Corporation, model risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and operational risks. The Enterprise Model Risk Policy defines model risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. All models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model, independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking. The Enterprise Model Risk Committee (EMRC), a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.\n\n## Mortgage Risk\n\nMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. For example, we trade and engage in marketmaking activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. In addition, we originate a variety of MBS, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 119.\n\n## Equity Market Risk\n\nEquity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.\n\n## Commodity Risk\n\nCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include",

        "page_content": "options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.\n\n## Issuer Credit Risk\n\nIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.\n\n## Market Liquidity Risk\n\nMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.\n\n## Trading Risk Management\n\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.\n\nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices\n\nare not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 88.\n\nGlobal Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.\n\nTrading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation's Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.",

Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 43 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below, it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology.\n\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.\n\nTable 43 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2021 and 2020 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe annual average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR decreased for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in diversification across asset classes.\n\nTable 43 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities\n\n|                                                                     | 2021     | 2021    | 2021     | 2021    | 2020     | 2020    | 2020     | 2020    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|---------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                               | Year End | Average | High (1) | Low (1) | Year End | Average | High (1) | Low (1) |\n| Foreign exchange                                                    | $ 11     | $ 12    | $ 21     | $ 5     | $ 8      | $ 7     | $ 25     | $ 2     |\n| Interest rate                                                       | 54       | 40      | 80       | 16      | 30       | 19      | 39       | 7       |\n| Credit                                                              | 73       | 69      | 84       | 53      | 79       | 58      | 91       | 25      |\n| Equity                                                              | 21       | 24      | 35       | 19      | 20       | 24      | 162      | 12      |\n| Commodities                                                         | 6        | 8       | 28       | 4       | 4        | 6       | 12       | 3       |\n| Portfolio diversification                                           | (114)    | (100)   | -        | -       | (72)     | (61)    | -        | -       |\n| Total covered positions portfolio                                   | 51       | 53      | 85       | 34      | 69       | 53      | 171      | 27      |\n| (2) Impact from less liquid exposures                               | 8        | 20      | -        | -       | 52       | 27      | -        | -       |\n| Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio | 59       | 73      | 125      | 46      | 121      | 80      | 169      | 30      |\n| Fair value option loans                                             | 51       | 50      | 65       | 31      | 52       | 52      | 84       | 7       |\n| Fair value option hedges                                            | 15       | 16      | 20       | 11      | 11       | 13      | 17       | 9       |\n| Fair value option portfolio diversification                         | (27)     | (32)    | -        | -       | (17)     | (24)    | -        | -       |\n| Total fair value option portfolio                                   | 39       | 34      | 53       | 23      | 46       | 41      | 86       | 9       |\n| Portfolio diversification                                           | (24)     | (10)    | -        | -       | (4)      | (15)    | -        | -       |\n| Total market-based portfolio                                        | $ 74     | $ 97    | 169      | 54      | $ 163    | $ 106   | 171      | 32      |\n\nThe graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for 2021, corresponding to the data in Table 43.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues.\n\nWe conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.\n\nDuring 2021, there were two days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.\n\n## Total Trading-related Revenue\n\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 -Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, tradingrelated revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the everchanging market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.\n\nThe following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2021 and 2020. During 2021, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $45 million. This compares to 2020 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 87 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $90 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Trading Portfolio Stress Testing\n\nBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.\n\nA set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.\n\nStress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprisewide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 85.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book\n\nThe following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.\n\nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\n\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning -and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve.\n\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.\n\nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.\n\nTable 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Table 45 Forward Rates\n\nTable 46 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes\n\n|                        | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                        | Federal Funds       | Three-month LIBOR   | 10-Year Swap        |\n| Spot rates             | 0.25 %              | 0.21 %              | 1.58 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 1.00                | 1.07                | 1.84                |\n|                        | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n| Spot rates             | 0.25 %              | 0.24 %              | 0.93 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 0.25                | 0.19                | 1.06                |\n\nTable 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2021 and 2020 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero.\n\nDuring 2021, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate scenarios was primarily due to ALM activity and an increase in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management -Regulatory Capital on page 89.\n\n|                                | Short Rate   | Long Rate   | December 31   | December 31   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)          | (bps)        | (bps)       | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Parallel Shifts                |              |             |               |               |\n| +100 bps instantaneous shift   | +100         | +100        | $ 6,542       | $ 10,468      |\n| -25 bps instantaneous shift    | -25          | -25         | (2,092)       | (2,766)       |\n| Flatteners                     |              |             |               |               |\n| Short-end instantaneous change | +100         | -           | 4,982         | 6,321         |\n| Long-end instantaneous change  | -            | -25         | (735)         | (1,686)       |\n| Steepeners                     |              |             |               |               |\n| Short-end instantaneous change | -25          | -           | (1,344)       | (1,084)       |\n| Long-end instantaneous change  | -            | +100        | 1,646         | 4,333         |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in",

In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.\n\n## Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 46. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation's non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 -Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Mortgage Banking Risk Management\n\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are\n\nsold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.\n\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded gains of $39 million, $321 million and $291 million. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 -Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Compliance and Operational Risk Management\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). We are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including those related to financial crimes and antimoney laundering, market conduct, trading activities, fair lending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, people or external events, and includes legal risk. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. The Corporation faces a number of key operational risks including third-party risk, model risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk. Operational risk can result in financial losses and reputational impacts and is a component in the calculation of total RWA used in the Basel 3 capital calculation. For more information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on page 88.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and control functions are required to understand their business processes and related risks and controls, including third-party dependencies and the related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment. In order to actively monitor and assess the performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions are responsible for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the Corporation. Collectively, these efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption.",

        "page_content": "Global Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business activities and processes and evaluate FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying issues and risks, determining and developing tests to be conducted by the Enterprise Independent Testing unit and reporting on the state of the control environment. Enterprise Independent Testing, an independent testing function within GRM, works with Global Compliance and Operational Risk, the FLUs and control functions in the identification of testing needs and test design, and is accountable for test execution, reporting and analysis of results. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment and validation through testing of key compliance and operational risk processes and controls across the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance Enterprise Policy and Operational Risk Management -Enterprise Policy set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational risk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global Compliance and Operational Risk's responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of the Corporation's compliance and operational risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC.\n\nA key operational risk facing the Corporation is information security, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk represents, among other things, exposure to failures or interruptions of service or breaches of security, including as a result of malicious technological attacks, that impact the confidentiality, availability or integrity of our or third parties' operations, systems or data. The Corporation seeks to mitigate information security risk and associated reputational and compliance risk by employing a multi-layered and intelligence-led Global Information Security Program, which is focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to and recovering from cyber threats and incidents and ensuring the Corporation's processes operate effectively and mitigate the aforementioned risks.\n\nThe Global Information Security Program is supported by three lines of defense. The Global Information Security Team within the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Global Information Security Program, which includes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the Corporation's information systems and data, conducting vulnerability and third-party information security assessments, information security event management (e.g., responding to ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks), evaluation of external cyber intelligence, supporting industry cybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies, as well as developing employee training to support adherence to the Corporation's policies and procedures. As the second line of defense, Global Compliance and Operational Risk independently assesses, monitors and tests information security risk across the Corporation as well as the effectiveness of the Global Information Security Program. Corporate Audit serves as the third line of defense, conducting additional independent review and validation of the first line processes and functions.\n\nThrough established governance structures, we have processes to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight of information security risk. These routines enable our three lines of defense and management to debate information security risks and monitor control performance to allow for further escalation to executive management, management and Board-level committees or to the Board, as appropriate. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Bank of America's Global Information Security Program, primarily through the ERC.\n\n## Reputational Risk Management\n\nReputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations. Reputational risk may result from many of the Corporation's activities, including those related to the management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls embedded throughout its business and risk management processes. We proactively monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner. If reputational risk events occur, we focus on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the Corporation's reputation. The Corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks. The Corporation's organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks. Reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to management and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In addition, each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk, including approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks.\n\n## Climate Risk Management\n\nClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts, such as rising average global temperatures and sea-level rise. These changes and events can have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as transition risk and physical risk. These risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. The impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers' operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational and/or litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment. Physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers' repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. In addition, it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people.",

        "page_content": "Effective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and welldeveloped processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. We continue to build out and enhance our climate risk management capabilities. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework (ESRPF) aligns with our Risk Framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to environmental and social risks, inclusive of climate risk.\n\nOur governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices and strategies by the Board, supported by its Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee and ERC, as well as the MRC and the Global ESG Committee, both of which are management-level committees comprised of senior leaders across every major FLU and control function.\n\nOur climate risk management efforts are overseen by the Global Climate Risk Executive who reports to the CRO. The Global Climate Risk Executive chairs the Climate Risk Steering Council, which meets monthly and shapes our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework.\n\nAs outlined in our ESRPF, we are focused on supporting and financing areas critical to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Accordingly, we have a goal, publicly announced in early 2021, to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal). More broadly, achieving this goal will require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies, and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders.\n\nOur progress towards achieving our Net Zero Goal is based on establishing the baseline for emissions associated with our financing activities often referred to as financed emissions. Currently, we are using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials methodology to assess our financed emissions. Additionally, given the urgency required to address climate change, we helped to launch the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in April 2021, which outlines guidelines for banks to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions including requirements for setting interim targets. As a member of NZBA, the Corporation and more than 100 other financial institution members representing more than 40 percent of the world's banking assets, have committed to set emission reduction targets for 2030. We plan to begin disclosure of financed emissions by 2023, and set 2030 targets for the significant majority of emissions in our portfolio.\n\nIn 2021, we also announced a goal to deploy $1 trillion by 2030 to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy by providing lending, capital raising, advisory and investment services, and by developing other client-driven financial solutions. This commitment anchors a broader $1.5\n\ntrillion sustainable finance goal to support both environmental transition and social inclusive development, which spans business activities across the globe. These goals are intended to help drive business opportunities and enhance risk management related to the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nFor more information about climate risk, see the Bank of America website. For more information about the Corporation's climate-related goals and commitments, including emissions associated with our operations and supply chain and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see the Corporation's 2021 Annual Report to shareholders that will be available on the Investor Relations portion of our website in March 2022. The contents of the Corporation's website and 2021 Annual Report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2021 Annual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation's control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.\n\n## Complex Accounting Estimates\n\nOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.\n\nThe more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.",

        "page_content": "## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 -Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe determination of allowance for credit losses is based on numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our quantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its expected credit losses (ECL) calculation, which have included a baseline scenario, which is derived from consensus estimates, downside scenarios, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario. Beginning in 2020, the scenarios incorporated the potential impacts of the pandemic and, beginning in the second quarter in 2021, an additional scenario was added to account for inflationary risk and higher interest rates. Generally, as the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for credit losses will change in a similar direction.\n\nThere are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment rates. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 6.6 percent, 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at 2.5 percent, 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 the latest consensus estimates for the U.S. average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 4.4 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 5.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, both of which were meaningfully better than our macroeconomic outlook as of December 31, 2020 and were factored into our December 31, 2021 allowance for credit losses estimate. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.2 percent and 4.7 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent year-overyear in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn addition to the above judgments and estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all\n\nof which have some degree of uncertainty. As the macroeconomic outlook improved in 2021, along with improvements in asset quality, the allowance for credit losses decreased to $13.8 billion from $20.7 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\nTo provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses, the Corporation compared the December 31, 2021 modeled ECL from the baseline scenario and our downside scenario. Relative to the baseline scenario, the downside scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment rate of approximately three percentage points higher than the consensus outlook, a decline in U.S. GDP followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of 14 percent at the trough. This sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $5 billion.\n\nWhile the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook. Importantly, the analysis does not incorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves and the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have offsetting effects on the estimate. Considering the variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative factors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2021 is appropriate.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards.\n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss",

        "page_content": "reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internallymodeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. For more information, see Note 20 -Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 -Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. For more information on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Note 20 -Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\n\nAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and\n\nregulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.\n\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nConsistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period.\n\nSee Note 19 -Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. For more information see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles , and Note 7 -Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2021 by using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessment included, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entityand reporting-unit specific considerations. Based on our qualitative assessment, we have concluded that it was not 'more likely than not' that the reporting units' fair values were less than their carrying values.\n\n## Certain Contingent Liabilities\n\nFor more information on the complex judgments associated with certain contingent liabilities, see Note 12 -Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

We also have audited the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Corporation's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\n\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses -Commercial and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's estimate of the expected credit losses in the",

        "page_content": "Corporation's loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $12.4 billion on total loans and leases of $971.3 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios, related weightings to each scenario and certain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including controls over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management's development, selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the\n\nmodel output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast models, the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios and related weightings and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves.\n\n## Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation carries certain financial instruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets and $6.9 billion of liabilities classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a recurring basis and $2.3 billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a nonrecurring basis, for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The Corporation determines the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs, such as volatility or price, may be determined using quantitativebased extrapolations or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment and estimation used by management to determine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls related to valuation models, significant unobservable inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments and comparison of management's estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and evaluating the reasonableness of management's significant unobservable inputs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina February 22, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1958.",

        "page_content": "## Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n\nBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term 'the Corporation' as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments, which include the Corporation's interests in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation's proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n\n## Significant Accounting Principles\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances where the interest is negative, the Corporation's policy is to present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense. For securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of these securities financing agreements are recorded in market\n\nmaking and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe Corporation's policy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements do not create material credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not necessary.\n\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of this collateral was $854.8 billion and $812.4 billion, of which $782.7 billion and $758.5 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell.\n\nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of Consolidated VIEs.\n\nIn addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on provisions contained in master netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities.\n\n## Trading Instruments\n\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a tradedate basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and similar activities.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging Activities\n\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are",

        "page_content": "not designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts.\n\nAll derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nValuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporation's own credit standing.\n\n## Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\n\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities.\n\nDerivatives used for other risk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included in market making and similar activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in market making and similar activities and other income.\n\n## Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)\n\nFor accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has\n\nceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship.\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporation's assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.\n\nCash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.\n\nNet investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities.\n\n## Securities\n\nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. Their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased for use in the Corporation's trading activities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and similar activities. Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation's asset and liability management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-tomaturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost.\n\nThe Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for expected credit losses (ECL), except for debt securities that are",

        "page_content": "guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the Corporation to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an expected credit loss. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of excepted credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nInterest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus qualifying observable price changes. These securities are reported in other assets.\n\n## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income.\n\nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables is defined as the level of\n\ndisaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation's three portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity . The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business commercial.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments and represents management's estimate of the ECL in the Corporation's loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. The ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contraasset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the current estimate of ECL.\n\nFor loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For openended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance.\n\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages",

        "page_content": "multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends.\n\nThe estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for troubled debt restructurings (TDR) is measured based on the present value of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, at the loan's collateral value or its observable market price, if available. The measurement of ECL for the renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as discussed above. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool.\n\nAlso included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data.\n\nWith the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe Corporation has identified the following three portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in estimating the Corporation's ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and\n\ngeography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the Corporation's historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the undrawn portion of the Corporation's HELOCs, which can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of default.\n\nFor loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate.\n\nFor loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation's fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative chargeoff amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrower-specific factors and the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e., paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model.",

        "page_content": "Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loan's contractual life at an individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic market. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook, and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies\n\nNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than chargeoffs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount.\n\nIn accordance with the Corporation's policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless\n\nrepayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\n\nConsumer loans secured by personal property, credit card loans and other unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans, except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR. Personal property-secured loans (including auto loans) are charged off to collateral value no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 120 days past due, or upon repossession of an auto or, for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing. Credit card and other unsecured customer loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud.\n\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer's billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Troubled Debt Restructurings\n\nConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.",

        "page_content": "Loans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.\n\nSecured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge. If these loans are contractually current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.\n\nA loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\n\n## COVID-19 Programs\n\nThe Corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic). In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the Corporation has elected to not apply TDR classification to eligible COVID-19 related loan modifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to loans that were current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are not classified as TDRs. The availability of this election expired on January 1, 2022. In addition, for loans modified in response to the pandemic that do not meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019), the Corporation is applying the guidance included in an interagency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies. This guidance states that loan modifications performed in light of the pandemic, including loan payment deferrals that are up to six months in duration, that were granted to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification program or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and nonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral period. The Corporation has continued to accrue interest during the deferral period using a constant effective yield method. For most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan modifications, the contractual interest that accrued during the deferral period is payable at the maturity of the loan. The Corporation includes these amounts with the unpaid principal balance when computing its allowance for credit losses. Amounts that are subsequently deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor the Corporation's financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions, including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be zero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially all of the Corporation's lessee arrangements are operating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Corporation made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe Corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporation's incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments",

        "page_content": "made prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a business segment.\n\nThe Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit.\n\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entityand reporting-unit specific considerations.\n\nIf the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.\n\nWhen performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance.\n\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing\n\ndocuments and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.\n\nThe Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust's liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights.\n\nOther VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.\n\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.\n\nRetained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests",

        "page_content": "are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nThe Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.\n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nObservable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS.\n\nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. This category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid\n\nin the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nIncome tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following summarizes the Corporation's revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.\n\n## Card Income\n\nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment network's rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner's members or customers on behalf of the Corporation.\n\n## Service Charges\n\nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation's Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep",

        "page_content": "account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.\n\n## Investment and Brokerage Services\n\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation's financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client's AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client's investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\nBrokerage fees include income earned from transactionbased services that are performed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management ( GWIM ) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\n## Investment Banking Income\n\nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees earned for the placement of a customer's debt or equity securities. The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in performing these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication.\n\nFinancial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting clients with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.\n\n## Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies\n\nThe Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2021, as its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.\n\n## Earnings Per Common Share\n\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding, excluding unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the foreign entity's functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currencydenominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.\n\n## Paycheck Protection Program\n\nThe Corporation is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which is a loan program that originated from the CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The PPP is designed to provide U.S. small businesses with cash-flow assistance through loans fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). If the borrower meets certain criteria and uses the proceeds towards certain eligible expenses, the borrower's obligation to repay the loan can be forgiven up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest. Upon borrower forgiveness, the SBA pays the Corporation for the principal and accrued interest owed on the loan. If the full principal of the loan is not forgiven, the loan will operate according to the original loan terms with the 100 percent SBA guaranty remaining. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had approximately 67,000 and 332,000 PPP loans with a carrying value of $4.7 billion and $22.7 billion. As compensation for originating the loans, the Corporation received lender processing fees from the SBA, which were capitalized, along with the loan origination costs, and are being amortized over the loans' contractual lives and recognized as interest income. Upon forgiveness of a loan and repayment by the SBA, any unrecognized net capitalized fees and costs related to the loan are recognized as interest income in that period.",

(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation's derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\n\nThe following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\n\nSheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.\n\nFor more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 10 -Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash .",

Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's ALM and risk management activities.\n\nThe Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\n\nMarket risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes\n\nforward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs.\n\nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation's investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.\n\nThe Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\n## Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges\n\nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities,",

These net gains reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily increase net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the majority of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately 3 years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions of 15 years.\n\n## Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges\n\n|                                                | Gains (Losses) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives   | Gains (Losses) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives   | Gains (Losses) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives   | Gains (Losses) in Income Reclassified from Accumulated OCI   | Gains (Losses) in Income Reclassified from Accumulated OCI   | Gains (Losses) in Income Reclassified from Accumulated OCI   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions, amounts pretax)          | 2021                                                          | 2020                                                          | 2019                                                          | 2021                                                         | 2020                                                         | 2019                                                         |\n| Cash flow hedges                               |                                                               |                                                               |                                                               |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |\n| Interest rate risk on variable-rate assets (1) | $ (2,686)                                                     | $ 763                                                         | $ 671                                                         | $ 148                                                        | $ (7)                                                        | $ (104)                                                      |\n| Price risk on forecasted MBS purchases (1)     | (249)                                                         | 241                                                           | -                                                             | 26                                                           | 9                                                            | -                                                            |\n| Price risk on certain compensation plans (2)   | 93                                                            | 85                                                            | 34                                                            | 55                                                           | 12                                                           | (2)                                                          |\n| Total                                          | $ (2,842)                                                     | $ 1,089                                                       | $ 705                                                         | $ 229                                                        | $ 14                                                         | $ (106)                                                      |\n| Net investment hedges                          |                                                               |                                                               |                                                               |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |\n| Foreign exchange risk (3)                      | $ 1,451                                                       | $ (834)                                                       | $ 22                                                          | $ 23                                                         | $ 4                                                          | $ 366                                                        |",

The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for 2021, 2020 and 2019. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense recorded on the hedged item.\n\n## Gains and Losses on Other Risk Management Derivatives\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                    | 2021   | 2020    | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Interest rate risk on mortgage activities (1, 2)                                         | $ (18) | $ 611   | $ 388  |\n| Credit risk on loans (2)                                                                 | (25)   | (68)    | (58)   |\n| Interest rate and foreign currency risk on asset and liability management activities (3) | 1,757  | (2,971) | 1,112  |\n| Price risk on certain compensation plans (4)                                             | 917    | 700     | 943    |\n\n## Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through Derivatives\n\nThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had transferred $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.0 billion and $5.5 billion.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation's policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities, which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation's Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items, including market making and similar activities and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.\n\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the 'Other' column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in market making and similar activities. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in market making and similar activities. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer\n\nservices for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market making and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in market making and similar activities. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.\n\nThe table below, which includes both derivatives and nonderivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation's sales and trading revenue in Global Markets , categorized by primary risk, for 2021, 2020 and 2019. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).

The table below is not presented on an FTE basis.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\n|                                 | Market making and similar activities   | Net Interest Income   | Other (1)   | Total    |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------|\n| (Dollars in millions)           | 2021                                   | 2021                  | 2021        | 2021     |\n| Interest rate risk              | $ 523                                  | $ 1,794               | $ 217       | $ 2,534  |\n| Foreign exchange risk           | 1,505                                  | (80)                  | 14          | 1,439    |\n| Equity risk                     | 4,581                                  | (5)                   | 1,834       | 6,410    |\n| Credit risk                     | 1,390                                  | 1,684                 | 556         | 3,630    |\n| Other risk (2)                  | 759                                    | (128)                 | 124         | 755      |\n| Total sales and trading revenue | $ 8,758                                | $ 3,265               | $ 2,745     | $ 14,768 |\n|                                 | 2020                                   | 2020                  | 2020        | 2020     |\n| Interest rate risk              | $ 2,236                                | $ 2,279               | $ 229       | $ 4,744  |\n| Foreign exchange risk           | 1,486                                  | (19)                  | 2           | 1,469    |\n| Equity risk                     | 3,656                                  | (77)                  | 1,801       | 5,380    |\n| Credit risk                     | 783                                    | 1,758                 | 331         | 2,872    |\n| Other risk (2)                  | 308                                    | 4                     | 44          | 356      |\n| Total sales and trading revenue | $ 8,469                                | $ 3,945               | $ 2,407     | $ 14,821 |\n|                                 | 2019                                   | 2019                  | 2019        | 2019     |\n| Interest rate risk              | $ 1,046                                | $ 1,697               | $ 113       | $ 2,856  |\n| Foreign exchange risk           | 1,293                                  | 61                    | 56          | 1,410    |\n| Equity risk                     | 3,563                                  | (634)                 | 1,569       | 4,498    |\n| Credit risk                     | 1,040                                  | 1,928                 | 519         | 3,487    |\n| Other risk (2)                  | 120                                    | 70                    | 54          | 244      |\n| Total sales and trading revenue | $ 7,062                                | $ 3,122               | $ 2,311     | $ 12,495 |\n\n## Credit Derivatives\n\nThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has",

The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation's maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.\n\n## Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral\n\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 144, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nCertain of the Corporation's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation's creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $91.4 billion and $96.5 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $79.3 billion and $88.6 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding crossproduct margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.\n\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $2.3 billion, including $1.4 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA).\n\nSome counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.\n\nThe following table presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by\n\nderivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2021 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties upon downgrade of the Corporation's or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings.\n\n## Additional Collateral Required to be Posted and Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade at December 31, 2021\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                   | One incremental notch   | Second incremental notch   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Additional collateral required to be posted upon downgrade              |                         |                            |\n| Bank of America Corporation                                             | $ 316                   | $ 823                      |\n| Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries (1)                              | 75                      | 646                        |\n| Derivative liabilities subject to unilateral termination upon downgrade |                         |                            |\n| Derivative liabilities                                                  | $ 32                    | $ 994                      |\n| Collateral posted                                                       | 25                      | 634                        |\n\n## Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives\n\nThe Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments on derivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties and its own credit quality. The Corporation calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default probabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures. Where no observable credit default data is available for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity.\n\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related hedge activities), which are recorded in market making and similar activities, for 2021, 2020 and 2019. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative liabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. FVA losses have the opposite impact.\n\n## Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on Derivatives (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)               | 2021   | 2020    | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Derivative assets (CVA)             | $ 208  | $ (118) | $ 72   |\n| Derivative assets/liabilities (FVA) | (2)    | (24)    | (2)    |\n| Derivative liabilities (DVA)        | 3      | 24      | (147)  |",

All of these loans are individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases\n\nCommercial nonperforming loans decreased to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021 from $2.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Consumer nonperforming loans increased to $3.0 billion at\n\nDecember 31, 2021 from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 driven by consumer real estate deferral activity.\n\nThe following table presents the Corporation's nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which measures the carrying value of the Corporation's loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower's credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality\n\nindicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.\n\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class of financing receivables and year of origination for term loan balances at December 31, 2021, including revolving loans that converted to term loans without an additional credit decision after origination or through a TDR.",

Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased to $22.4 billion at December 31, 2021 from $38.7 billion (to 3.91 percent from 7.31 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2020, which was broad-based across industries.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nModifications of consumer real estate loans are classified as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been granted. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.\n\nConsumer real estate loans of $306 million that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in\n\nrepayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were included in TDRs at December 31, 2021, of which $87 million were classified as nonperforming and $55 million were loans fully insured.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $101 million and $123 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fullyinsured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. During 2021 and 2020, the Corporation reclassified $64 million and $182 million of consumer real estate loans, to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nThe table below presents the December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during 2021, 2020 and 2019. The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables include loans that were initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans that had previously been classified as TDRs and were modified again during the period.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate -TDRs Entered into During 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n|                       | Unpaid Principal Balance   | Carrying Value    | Pre- Modification Interest Rate   | Post- Modification Interest Rate (1)   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions) | December 31, 2021          | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021                 | December 31, 2021                      |\n| Residential mortgage  | $ 891                      | $ 788             | 3.48 %                            | 3.38 %                                 |\n| Home equity           | 107                        | 77                | 3.60                              | 3.59                                   |\n| Total                 | $ 998                      | $ 865             | 3.49                              | 3.41                                   |\n|                       | December 31, 2020          | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2020                 | December 31, 2020                      |\n| Residential mortgage  | $ 732                      | $ 646             | 3.66 %                            | 3.59 %                                 |\n| Home equity           | 87                         | 69                | 3.67                              | 3.61                                   |\n| Total                 | $ 819                      | $ 715             | 3.66                              | 3.59                                   |\n|                       | December 31, 2019          | December 31, 2019 | December 31, 2019                 | December 31, 2019                      |\n| Residential mortgage  | $ 464                      | $ 377             | 4.19 %                            | 4.13 %                                 |\n| Home equity           | 141                        | 101               | 5.04                              | 4.31                                   |\n| Total                 | $ 605                      | $ 478             | 4.39                              | 4.17                                   |",

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer's available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation\n\nagencies that provide solutions to customers' entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.\n\nThe table below provides information on the Corporation's Credit Card and Other Consumer TDR portfolio including the December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates of loans that were modified in TDRs during 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Credit Card and Other Consumer -TDRs Entered into During 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\n|                          | Unpaid Principal Balance   | Carrying Value (1)   | Pre- Modification Interest Rate   | Post- Modification Interest Rate   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)    | December 31, 2021          | December 31, 2021    | December 31, 2021                 | December 31, 2021                  |\n| Credit card              | $ 237                      | $ 248                | 18.45 %                           | 4.09 %                             |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 23                         | 16                   | 5.88                              | 5.88                               |\n| Total                    | $ 260                      | $ 264                | 17.68                             | 4.20                               |\n|                          | December 31, 2020          | December 31, 2020    | December 31, 2020                 | December 31, 2020                  |\n| Credit card              | $ 269                      | $ 277                | 18.16 %                           | 5.63 %                             |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 52                         | 37                   | 5.83                              | 5.83                               |\n| Total                    | $ 321                      | $ 314                | 16.70                             | 5.65                               |\n|                          | December 31, 2019          | December 31, 2019    | December 31, 2019                 | December 31, 2019                  |\n| Credit card              | $ 340                      | $ 355                | 19.18 %                           | 5.35 %                             |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 40                         | 21                   | 5.23                              | 5.21                               |\n| Total                    | $ 380                      | $ 376                | 18.42                             | 5.34                               |",

Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 10 percent of new credit card TDRs and 18 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification.\n\n## Commercial Loans\n\nModifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation's loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation's risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.\n\nAt the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification.\n\nDuring 2021, the carrying value of the Corporation's commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion for 2020 and 2019. At\n\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had commitments to lend $283 million, $402 million and $445 million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was $262 million, $218 million and $207 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe Corporation had LHFS of $15.6 billion and $9.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $43.6 billion, $20.1 billion and $30.6 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $37.3 billion, $19.7 billion and $28.9 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Accrued Interest Receivable\n\nAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans heldfor-sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOutstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. During 2021 and 2020, the Corporation reversed $446 million and $512 million of interest and fee income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan.\n\nFor the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during 2021 and 2020, interest and fee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as nonperforming was not significant.

        "page_content": "## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management's best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase in the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020, which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase in credit card as the Corporation now reserves for the life of these receivables. The increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments included $119 million in the consumer portfolio for the undrawn portion of HELOCs and $191 million in the commercial portfolio. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends.\n\nThe December 31, 2021 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic outlooks that included a baseline scenario, which is derived from consensus estimates, a downside scenario that assumed a significantly longer period until full economic recovery, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing, a scenario to account for inflationary risk and higher interest rates and an upside scenario to consider the potential for improvement in the consensus outlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be just above five percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly declines to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, in\n\nthis economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is forecasted to grow at 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023. For comparison, as of December 31, 2020, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 6.6 percent, 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at 2.5 percent, 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses considered the impact of enacted government stimulus measures and continued to factor in the uncertainty resulting from the unprecedented nature of the current public health crisis and risks that may prevent a full economic recovery.\n\nWhile there has been improvement across the U.S. economy, the Corporation continues to factor into its allowance for credit losses an estimated impact from higher-risk segments that included leveraged loans and industries such as travel and entertainment, which have been adversely impacted by the effects of the pandemic.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2021 was $13.8 billion, a decrease of $6.8 billion compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of $6.4 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $422 million decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to $342 million in the consumer real estate portfolio, $2.7 billion in the credit card and other consumer portfolio, and $3.8 billion in the commercial portfolio. Similarly, the provision for credit losses improved $15.9 billion to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 compared to provision expense of $11.3 billion and $3.6 billion in 2020 and 2019. The benefit in 2021 was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.\n\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $50.1 billion in 2021 driven by commercial loans, which increased $60.4 billion, excluding small business, primarily driven by Global Markets . Consumer loans increased $7.0 billion primarily driven by securities-based lending, partially offset by lower consumer real estate due to prepayments in a low rate environment.\n\nThe changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the following table.",

The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation's use of VIEs, see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\nThe tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2021 and 2020 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation's maximum loss exposure at December 31, 2021 and 2020 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation's\n\nmaximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.\n\nThe Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 -Securities or Note 5 -Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities.\n\nThe Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2021, 2020 and 2019 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.\n\nThe Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $968 million and $929 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.",

        "page_content": "## First-lien Mortgage Securitizations\n\nAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHAinsured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential\n\nmortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described in Note 12 -Commitments and Contingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties.\n\nThe table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## First-lien Mortgage Securitizations\n\n|                                            | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                      | 2021                            | 2020                            | 2019                            | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| Proceeds from loan sales (1)               | $ 6,664                         | $ 15,823                        | $ 6,858                         | $ 10,874              | $ 5,084               | $ 8,661               |\n| Gains on securitizations (2)               | 9                               | 728                             | 27                              | 156                   | 61                    | 103                   |\n| Repurchases from securitization trusts (3) | 756                             | 436                             | 881                             | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $115.4 billion and $160.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $392 million, $474 million and $585 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 -Fair Value Measurements .\n\nDuring 2020, the Corporation completed the sale of $9.3 billion of consumer real estate loans through GNMA loan securitizations. As part of the securitizations, the Corporation retained $8.4 billion of MBS, which are classified as debt securities carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total gains on loan sales of $704 million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2021 and 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Home Equity Loans\n\nThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.\n\n## Credit Card Securitizations\n\nThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation's continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller's interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests, including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts.\n\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation issued new senior debt securities issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust of $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the credit card securitization trust issued $161 million, $161 million and $202 million, respectively, of these subordinate securities.\n\n## Resecuritization Trusts\n\nThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.\n\nThe Corporation resecuritized $28.9 billion, $39.0 billion and $24.4 billion of securities during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized at their fair value of $2.2 billion, $6.1 billion and $5.2 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021 and 2019, substantially all of the securities were classified as trading account assets. All of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading account assets. Of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds during 2020, $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion were classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively. Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Municipal Bond Trusts\n\nThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors.\n\nThe Corporation's liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $4.1 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2021 was 6.3 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Other Variable Interest Entities\n\nThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Other VIEs\n\n|                                       | Consolidated      | Unconsolidated    | Total             | Consolidated      | Unconsolidated    | Total             |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2020 |\n| Maximum loss exposure                 | $ 4,819           | $ 27,790          | $ 32,609          | $ 4,106           | $ 23,870          | $ 27,976          |\n| On-balance sheet assets               |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Trading account assets                | $ 2,552           | $ 626             | $ 3,178           | $ 2,080           | $ 623             | $ 2,703           |\n| Debt securities carried at fair value | -                 | 7                 | 7                 | -                 | 9                 | 9                 |\n| Loans and leases                      | 2,503             | 47                | 2,550             | 2,108             | 184               | 2,292             |\n| Allowance for loan and lease losses   | (2)               | (12)              | (14)              | (3)               | (3)               | (6)               |\n| All other assets                      | 28                | 26,628            | 26,656            | 54                | 22,553            | 22,607            |\n| Total                                 | $ 5,081           | $ 27,296          | $ 32,377          | $ 4,239           | $ 23,366          | $ 27,605          |\n| On-balance sheet liabilities          |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Short-term borrowings                 | $ 51              | $ -               | $ 51              | $ 22              | $ -               | $ 22              |\n| Long-term debt                        | 211               | -                 | 211               | 111               | -                 | 111               |\n| All other liabilities                 | -                 | 6,548             | 6,548             | -                 | 5,658             | 5,658             |\n| Total                                 | $ 262             | $ 6,548           | $ 6,810           | $ 133             | $ 5,658           | $ 5,791           |\n| Total assets of VIEs                  | $ 5,081           | $ 92,249          | $ 97,330          | $ 4,239           | $ 77,984          | $ 82,223          |",

        "page_content": "## Customer VIEs\n\nCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.\n\nThe Corporation's maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation's investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs.\n\n## Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs\n\nThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $235 million and $298 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Investment VIEs\n\nThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation's consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $1.0 billion and $494 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $7.1 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.\n\n## Leveraged Lease Trusts\n\nThe Corporation's net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.\n\n## Tax Credit VIEs\n\nThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing\n\nmember and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $25.7 billion and $22.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Corporation's risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.\n\nThe Corporation's investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $12.6 billion and $11.2 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $5.8 billion and $5.0 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion and reported pretax losses in other income of $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $882 million, respectively. These tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation's annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. The Corporation may be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.\n\n## NOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe table below presents goodwill balances by business segment at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment testing are the operating segments or one level below.\n\n## Goodwill\n\n|                                       | December 31   | December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                 | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Consumer Banking                      | $ 30,137      | $ 30,123      |\n| Global Wealth & Investment Management | 9,677         | 9,677         |\n| Global Banking (1)                    | 24,026        | 23,969        |\n| Global Markets                        | 5,182         | 5,182         |\n| Total goodwill                        | $ 69,022      | $ 68,951      |\n\nDuring 2021, the Corporation completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2021 using qualitative assessments for all applicable reporting units. Based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Corporation determined there was no impairment. For more information on the use of qualitative assessments, see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nAt both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying value of intangible assets was $2.2 billion. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, intangible assets included $1.6 billion of intangible assets associated with trade names, substantially all of which had an indefinite life and, accordingly, are not being amortized. Amortization of intangibles expense was $76 million, $95 million and $112 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019.",

Generally, these options do not impact the lease term because the Corporation is not reasonably certain that it will exercise the options.\n\nThe following table provides information on the right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and weighted-average discount rates and lease terms at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\n|                                                                                                 | December 31   | December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                           | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Right-of-use asset                                                                              | $ 10,233      | $ 10,000      |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                               | 10,858        | 10,474        |\n| Weighted-average discount rate used to calculate present value of future minimum lease payments | 2.91 %        | 3.38 %        |\n| Weighted-average lease term (in years)                                                          | 9.0           | 8.4           |\n| Lease Cost and Supplemental Information:                                                        |               |               |\n| Operating lease cost                                                                            | $ 2,025       | $ 2,149       |\n| Variable lease cost (1)                                                                         | 462           | 474           |\n| (2) Total lease cost                                                                            | $ 2,487       | $ 2,623       |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities (3)                | $ 1,713       | $ 851         |\n| Operating cash flows from operating leases (4)                                                  | 1,964         | 2,039         |\n\n## Maturity Analysis\n\nThe maturities of lessor and lessee arrangements outstanding at December 31, 2021 are presented in the table below based on undiscounted cash flows.\n\n## Maturities of Lessor and Lessee Arrangements\n\n(1)\n\n|                                        | Lessor            | Lessor                                     | Lessee            |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                        | Operating Leases  | Sales-type and Direct Financing Leases (2) | Operating Leases  |\n| (Dollars in millions)                  | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021                          | December 31, 2021 |\n| 2022                                   | $ 848             | $ 5,208                                    | $ 1,917           |\n| 2023                                   | 742               | 4,617                                      | 1,716             |\n| 2024                                   | 591               | 3,888                                      | 1,550             |\n| 2025                                   | 412               | 1,318                                      | 1,309             |\n| 2026                                   | 296               | 1,634                                      | 1,153             |\n| Thereafter                             | 696               | 1,358                                      | 4,758             |\n| Total undiscounted cash flows          | $ 3,585           | 18,023                                     | 12,403            |\n| Less: Net present value adjustment (3) |                   | 1,217                                      | 1,545             |\n| Total                                  |                   | $ 16,806                                   | $ 10,858          |",

The Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements and short-term borrowings under the fair value option. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 -Fair Value Option .\n\n## Offsetting of Securities Financing Agreements\n\nSubstantially all of the Corporation's securities financing activities are transacted under legally enforceable master repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of\n\ndefault by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.\n\nThe Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

For securities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To determine whether the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may receive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate.\n\n## Short-term Bank Notes\n\nBank of America, N.A. maintains a global program to offer up to a maximum of $75.0 billion outstanding at any one time, of\n\nbank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least seven days from the date of issue. Short-term bank notes outstanding under this program totaled $1.8 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These short-term bank notes, along with Federal Home Loan Bank advances, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased, are included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $5.9 billion and $7.0 billion, predominantly related to cash segregated in compliance with securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central banks to meet reserve requirements.",

The Corporation's ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying value for aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2021. Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value of a referenced index or security. In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the table as maturing at their contractual maturity date.",

These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Credit Extension Commitments\n\nThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.7 billion and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying value of the Corporation's credit extension commitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020, excluding commitments accounted for under\n\nthe fair value option, was $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, which predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower's ability to pay.\n\nThe following table includes the notional amount of commitments of $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair value for these commitments of $97 million and $99 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation's loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 21 -Fair Value Option.",

These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $4.0 billion and $3.9 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $395 million and $213 million.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\n## Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection\n\nThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2021 and\n\n2020, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $6.3 billion and $7.1 billion. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation's maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $928 million and $1.1 billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.\n\n## Merchant Services\n\nPrior to July 1, 2020, a significant portion of the Corporation's merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in which the Corporation held a 49 percent ownership interest. Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant contracts and began performing merchant processing services for these merchants.",

        "page_content": "The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants, due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable regulatory and card network rules, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. The total amount of transactions processed for the preceding six-month period, which was $476.2 billion, is an estimate of the Corporation's maximum potential exposure as of December 31, 2021. The Corporation's risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation's reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant. The Corporation continues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic impacts of the pandemic.\n\n## Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. The Corporation's potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the Corporation's contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure under these membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote.\n\n## Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services\n\nIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation's obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients' accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the Corporation on behalf of clients or their customers. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote.\n\n## Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo Program\n\nThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation's rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and\n\nperformance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation's guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $42.0 billion and $22.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.\n\n## Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide indemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases).\n\n## Unresolved Repurchase Claims\n\nUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\n\nThe notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $8.4 billion and $8.5 billion. These balances included $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid.",

        "page_content": "During 2021, the Corporation received $49 million in new repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2021, $141 million in claims were resolved.\n\n## Reserve and Related Provision\n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation's best estimate of probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.\n\n## Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n\nAs a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters described below whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigationrelated expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $164 million and $823 million was recognized in 2021 and 2020.\n\nFor any matter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation's estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $1.0 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The\n\nestimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure.\n\nInformation is provided below regarding the nature of the litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages. Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described below, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation's control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation's business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm.\n\n## Ambac Bond Insurance Litigation\n\nAmbac Assurance Corporation and the Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation (together, Ambac) have filed four separate lawsuits against the Corporation and its subsidiaries relating to bond insurance policies Ambac provided on certain securitized pools of HELOCs, first-lien subprime home equity loans, fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and negative amortization pay-option adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Ambac alleges that they have paid or will pay claims as a result of defaults in the underlying loans and asserts that the defendants misrepresented the characteristics of the underlying loans and/ or breached certain contractual representations and warranties regarding the underwriting and servicing of the loans. In those actions where the Corporation is named as a defendant, Ambac contends the Corporation is liable on successor and vicarious liability theories. These actions are at various procedural stages with material developments provided below.\n\nAmbac v. Countrywide I\n\nAmbac named the Corporation and several Countrywide entities as defendants in an action filed on September 28, 2010 in New York Supreme Court asserting claims for fraudulent inducement as well as breach of contract and seeking damages in excess of $2.2 billion, plus punitive damages. The Supreme Court dismissed Ambac's fraudulent inducement claim, and on May 11, 2021, the First Department, a New York State appellate court (First Department), affirmed the dismissal. The Supreme Court has scheduled a non-jury trial for September 7, 2022 on the contract claim that remains.\n\nAmbac v. Countrywide II\n\nOn December 30, 2014, Ambac filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court against the same defendants, claiming fraudulent inducement against Countrywide, and successor and vicarious liability against the Corporation, while seeking damages in excess of $600 million, plus punitive damages.\n\nAmbac v. Countrywide IV\n\nOn July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an action in New York Supreme Court against Countrywide asserting the same claims for fraudulent inducement that Ambac asserted in the now dismissed Ambac v. Countrywide III. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $350 million, plus punitive damages. On December 8, 2020, the New York Supreme Court dismissed Ambac's complaint. On February 8, 2022, the First Department affirmed the dismissal.",

        "page_content": "## Ambac v. First Franklin\n\nOn April 16, 2012, Ambac filed an action against BANA, First Franklin and various Merrill Lynch entities, including Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, in New York Supreme Court relating to guaranty insurance Ambac provided on a First Franklin securitization sponsored by Merrill Lynch. The complaint alleges fraudulent inducement and breach of contract, including breach of contract claims against BANA based upon its servicing of the loans in the securitization. Ambac seeks as damages hundreds of millions of dollars that Ambac alleges it has paid or will pay in claims.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessment\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging failure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $542 million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014.\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANA's alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those quarters and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC's interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC's claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied BANA's partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC's claims.\n\n## LIBOR\n\nThe Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBORbased financial instruments as a result of collusion or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive relief. All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ('District Court'). The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and dismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has also substantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain individual and putative class plaintiffs' antitrust claims for lack of standing. On December 30, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities. On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a\n\nclass of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\n\n## U.S. Bank -Harborview and SURF/OWNIT Repurchase Litigation\n\nBeginning in 2011, U.S. Bank, National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee for the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10 and various SURF/OWNIT RMBS trusts filed complaints against the Corporation, Countrywide entities, Merrill Lynch entities and other affiliates in New York Supreme Court alleging breaches of representations and warranties. The defendants and certain certificate-holders in the trusts agreed to settle the respective matters in amounts not material to the Corporation, subject to acceptance by U.S. Bank. The litigations have been stayed pending finalization of the settlements.\n\n## NOTE 13 Shareholders' Equity\n\n## Common Stock\n\n## Declared Quarterly Cash Dividends on Common Stock (1)\n\n| Declaration Date   | Record Date       | Payment Date       | Dividend Per Share   |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| February 2, 2022   | March 4, 2022     | March 25, 2022     | $ 0.21               |\n| October 20, 2021   | December 3, 2021  | December 31, 2021  | 0.21                 |\n| July 21, 2021      | September 3, 2021 | September 24, 2021 | 0.21                 |\n| April 22, 2021     | June 4, 2021      | June 25, 2021      | 0.18                 |\n| January 19, 2021   | March 5, 2021     | March 26, 2021     | 0.18                 |\n\nThe cash dividends paid per share of common stock were $0.78 $0.72 and $0.66 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nThe table below summarizes common stock repurchases during 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Common Stock Repurchase Summary\n\n| (in millions)                                                    | 2021     | 2020    | 2019     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|----------|\n| Total share repurchases, including CCAR capital plan repurchases | 615      | 227     | 956      |\n| Purchase price of shares repurchased and retired                 |          |         |          |\n| CCAR capital plan repurchases                                    | $ 25,126 | $ 7,025 | $ 25,644 |\n| Other authorized repurchases                                     | -        | -       | 2,500    |\n| Total shares repurchased                                         | $ 25,126 | $ 7,025 | $ 28,144 |\n\nDue to uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve imposed various restrictions on share repurchase programs and dividends during 2020 and the first half of 2021. Those restrictions ended as of July 1, 2021 for large banks, including the Corporation, and large banks returned to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve's stress capital buffer (SCB) framework.\n\nDuring 2021, in connection with employee stock plans, the Corporation issued 68 million shares of its common stock and, to satisfy tax withholding obligations, repurchased 26 million shares of its common stock. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had reserved 562 million unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, convertible notes and preferred stock.",

The Series PP preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends.\n\nOn October 26, 2021, the Corporation issued 52,000 shares of 4.250% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series QQ for $1.3 billion, with quarterly dividends commencing in February 2022.

The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds 130 percent of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the Corporation will still pay any accrued dividends payable.",

Substantially all of these warrants were exercised on or before their expiration date of January 16, 2019.\n\n## NOTE 16 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions\n\nThe Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and FDIC (collectively, U.S. banking regulators) jointly establish regulatory capital adequacy rules, including Basel 3, for U.S. banking organizations. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the Federal Reserve. The Corporation's banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.\n\nThe Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory riskbased capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.\n\nThe Corporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Corporation's insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.\n\nThe table below presents capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for the Corporation and BANA.\n\n## Regulatory Capital

        "page_content": "The capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S. banking regulators require institutions to meet the established minimums outlined in the table above. Failure to meet the minimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's financial position. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were well capitalized.\n\nDue to uncertainty from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve imposed various restrictions on share repurchase programs and dividends during 2020 and the first half of 2021. In conjunction with its release of 2021 CCAR supervisory stress test results, the Federal Reserve announced those restrictions would end as of July 1, 2021 for large banks, including the Corporation, and large banks would be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve's SCB framework. For more information, see Note 13 -Shareholders' Equity .\n\n## Other Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires the Corporation's bank subsidiaries to maintain reserve requirements based on a percentage of certain deposit liabilities. The average daily reserve balance requirements, in excess of vault cash, maintained by the Corporation with the Federal Reserve Bank were $0 for 2021 and $3.8 billion for 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $4.0 billion and $4.9 billion, and securities with a fair value of $10.6 billion and $16.8 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations. Cash held on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank to meet reserve requirements and cash and cash equivalents segregated in compliance with securities regulations are components of restricted cash. For more information, see Note 10 -Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash . In addition, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations of $28.6 billion and $10.9 billion primarily recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Bank Subsidiary Distributions\n\nThe primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from its bank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America California, N.A. In 2021, the Corporation received dividends of $15.6 billion from BANA and $29 million from Bank of America California, N.A.\n\nThe amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank's net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period. In 2022, BANA can declare and pay dividends of approximately $14.7 billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2022 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. Bank of America California, N.A. can pay dividends of $234 million in 2022 plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2022 up to the date of any such dividend declaration.\n\n## NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plans\n\nThe Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement health and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices.\n\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-selected investments, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for participant balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature.\n\nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits or interest credits in accordance with the terms of the plan document.\n\nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension plan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The Corporation made no contribution under this agreement in 2021 or 2020. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.\n\nThe Corporation's noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees.\n\nIn addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefitseligible employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.\n\nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The estimate of the Corporation's PBO associated with these plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2021 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of $895 million at December 31, 2021. The decreases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2020 resulted in an increase to the PBO of approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020. Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2021 and 2020 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate.",

Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the 'projected unit credit' actuarial method. For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year.\n\nAssumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.25 percent for 2022, reducing in steps to 5.00 percent in 2027 and later years.\n\nThe Corporation's net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is sensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bp decline in discount rates and expected return on assets would not have had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost for 2021.\n\n## Pretax Amounts included in Accumulated OCI and OCI\n\n|                                                              | Qualified Pension Plan   | Qualified Pension Plan   | Non-U.S. Pension Plans   | Non-U.S. Pension Plans   | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans   | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans   | Postretirement Health and Life Plans   | Postretirement Health and Life Plans   | Total   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                        | 2021                     | 2020                     | 2021                     | 2020                     | 2021                                   | 2020                                   | 2021                                   | 2020                                   | 2021    | 2020    |\n| Net actuarial loss (gain)                                    | $ 3,425                  | $ 3,912                  | $ 456                    | $ 628                    | $ 945                                  | $ 987                                  | $ 4                                    | $ 66                                   | $ 4,830 | $ 5,593 |\n| Prior service cost (credits)                                 | -                        | -                        | 17                       | 18                       | -                                      | -                                      | (3)                                    | (4)                                    | 14      | 14      |\n| Amounts recognized in accumulated OCI                        | $ 3,425                  | $ 3,912                  | $ 473                    | $ 646                    | $ 945                                  | $ 987                                  | $ 1                                    | $ 62                                   | $ 4,844 | $ 5,607 |\n| Current year actuarial loss (gain)                           | $ (294)                  | $ 219                    | $ (154)                  | $ 79                     | $ 21                                   | $ 29                                   | $ (41)                                 | $ 47                                   | $ (468) | $ 374   |\n| Amortization of actuarial gain (loss) and prior service cost | (193)                    | (173)                    | (19)                     | (12)                     | (63)                                   | (50)                                   | (20)                                   | (27)                                   | (295)   | (262)   |\n| Current year prior service cost (credit)                     | -                        | -                        | -                        | 3                        | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | -       | 3       |\n| Amounts recognized in OCI                                    | $ (487)                  | $ 46                     | $ (173)                  | $ 70                     | $ (42)                                 | $ (21)                                 | $ (61)                                 | $ 20                                   | $ (763) | $ 115   |",

        "page_content": "## Plan Assets\n\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement vehicle for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation's policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The Corporation's investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures.\n\nThe assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan's assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plans' liabilities. The selected asset\n\nallocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy.\n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds' past experience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plan's obligations.\n\nThe target allocations for 2022 by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $398 million (1.80 percent of total plan assets) and $274 million (1.26 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 2022 Target Allocation\n\n|                   | Percentage             | Percentage             | Percentage                           |\n|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Asset Category    | Qualified Pension Plan | Non-U.S. Pension Plans | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans |\n| Equity securities | 15 - 50%               | 0 - 25%                | 0 - 5%                               |\n| Debt securities   | 45 - 80%               | 40 - 70%               | 95 - 100%                            |\n| Real estate       | 0 - 10%                | 0 - 15%                | 0 - 5%                               |\n| Other             | 0 - 5%                 | 10 - 40%               | 0 - 5%                               |\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Corporation, see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 -Fair Value Measurements .

        "page_content": "## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Corporation maintains qualified and non-qualified defined contribution retirement plans. The Corporation recorded expense of $1.2 billion in both 2021 and 2020 and $1.0 billion in 2019 related to the qualified defined contribution plans. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 173 million and 189 million shares of the Corporation's common stock were held by these plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on common stock were $139 million, $138 million and $133 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nCertain non-U.S. employees are covered under defined contribution pension plans that are separately administered in accordance with local laws.\n\n## NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation Plans\n\nThe Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank of America Key Employee Equity Plan (KEEP). On April 20, 2021, Bank of America's shareholders approved the amendment and restatement of the KEEP, changing its name to the 'Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan' and increasing the number of shares available for grant by 115 million. Subsequent to the amendment and restatement, 715 million shares of the Corporation's common stock are authorized to be used for grants of awards under this plan.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Corporation granted 99 million and 86 million RSU awards to certain employees under the KEEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement date. Of the RSUs granted in 2021 and 2020, 81 million and 29 million will generally vest over four years and 18 million and 57 million will vest over three years. The four-year awards vest primarily in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date while the three-year awards vest primarily in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2021 and 2020 that vest over four years, 27 million and 25 million do not include retirement eligibility. For all other RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible, they are deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $3.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.1 billion, and the related income tax benefit was $723 million, $505 million and $511 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there was an estimated $2.3 billion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to certain share-based compensation awards that is expected to be recognized over a period of up to four years, with a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.\n\n## Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $2.3 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The table below presents the status at December 31, 2021 of the share-settled restricted stock and restricted stock units and changes during 2021.\n\n## Stock-settled Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\n|                                  | Shares/Units   | Weighted- average Grant Date Fair Value   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at January 1, 2021   | 167,953,229    | $ 30.60                                   |\n| Granted                          | 96,804,487     | 32.32                                     |\n| Vested                           | (69,337,350)   | 30.19                                     |\n| Canceled                         | (10,369,524)   | 32.58                                     |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2021 | 185,050,842    | 31.54                                     |\n\n## Cash-settled Restricted Units\n\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately two million cash-settled restricted units remain outstanding. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the amount of cash paid to settle the RSUs that vested was $72 million, $81 million and $84 million, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 19 Income Taxes\n\nThe components of income tax expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the table below.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)       | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Current income tax expense  |         |         |         |\n| U.S. federal                | $ 1,076 | $ 1,092 | $ 1,136 |\n| U.S. state and local        | 775     | 1,076   | 901     |\n| Non-U.S.                    | 985     | 670     | 852     |\n| Total current expense       | 2,836   | 2,838   | 2,889   |\n| Deferred income tax expense |         |         |         |\n| U.S. federal                | 962     | (799)   | 2,001   |\n| U.S. state and local        | 491     | (233)   | 223     |\n| Non-U.S.                    | (2,291) | (705)   | 211     |\n| Total deferred expense      | (838)   | (1,737) | 2,435   |\n| Total income tax expense    | $ 1,998 | $ 1,101 | $ 5,324 |\n\nTotal income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of items that are included in OCI each period. For more information, see Note 14 -Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) . Other tax effects included in OCI each period resulted in a benefit of $877 million in 2021 and expense of $1.5 billion, and $1.9 billion in 2020 and 2019.\n\nIncome tax expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 varied from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes. The Corporation's federal statutory tax rate was 21 percent for 2021, 2020 and 2019. A reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal income tax expense, calculated by applying the federal statutory tax rate, to the Corporation's actual income tax expense, and the effective tax rates for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the following table.",

Included in the UTB balance are some items the recognition of which would not affect the effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the portion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the UTB balance may decrease by as much as $398 million during the next 12 months, since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition.\n\nThe Corporation recognized interest expense of $32 million and $9 million in 2021 and 2020 and an interest benefit of $19 million in 2019. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation's accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was $167 million and $130 million.\n\nThe Corporation files income tax returns in more than 100 state and non-U.S. jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other tax authorities in countries and states in which the Corporation has significant business operations examine tax returns\n\nperiodically (continuously in some jurisdictions).

The majority of the Corporation's U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for the relevant entities and the indefinite period to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could lead management to reassess such valuation allowance conclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on approximately $5.0 billion of temporary differences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, the amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.\n\n## NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 -Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the\n\nfair value option. For more information, see Note 21 -Fair Value Option.\n\n## Valuation Techniques\n\nThe following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation's assets and liabilities. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDuring 2021, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\n\nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market's perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\n\n## Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity",

        "page_content": "dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation's own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.\n\n## Loans and Loan Commitments\n\nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\n\n## Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market.\n\n## Asset-backed Secured Financings\n\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.",

Transfers into Level 3 occur primarily due to decreased price observability, and\n\ntransfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.\n\n## Level 3 -Fair Value Measurements (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                     | Balance January 1   | Total Realized/ Unrealized Gains (Losses) in Net Income (2)   | Gains (Losses) in OCI (3)   | Purchases   | Sales     | Gross Issuances   | Settlements   | Gross Transfers into Level 3   | Gross Transfers out of Level 3   | Balance December 31   | Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) in Net Income Related to Financial Instruments Still Held (2)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year Ended December 31, 2021                                              |                     |                                                               |                             |             |           |                   |               |                                |                                  |                       |                                                                                                     |\n| Trading account assets:                                                   |                     |                                                               |                             |             |           |                   |               |                                |                                  |                       |                                                                                                     |\n| Corporate securities, trading loans and other                             | $ 1,359             | $ (17)                                                        | $ -

        "page_content": "In the previous tables, instruments backed by residential and commercial real estate assets include RMBS, commercial MBS, whole loans and mortgage CDOs. Commercial loans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equitylinked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.\n\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.\n\nThe levels of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories.\n\n## Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from Unobservable Inputs\n\n## Loans and Securities\n\nA significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A significant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value for long positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\n## Structured Liabilities and Derivatives\n\nFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield,\n\nupfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.\n\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\nFor equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value.\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value\n\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\n|                              | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)        | Level 2             | Level 3             | Level 2             | Level 3             |\n| Assets                       |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Loans held-for-sale          | $ 634               | $ 24                | $ 1,020             | $ 792               |\n| Loans and leases (1)         | -                   | 213                 | -                   | 301                 |\n| Foreclosed properties (2, 3) | -                   | 5                   | -                   | 17                  |\n| Other assets                 | 256                 | 2,046               | 323                 | 576                 |\n\n|                       | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                       | 2021             | 2020             | 2019             |\n| Assets                |                  |                  |                  |\n| Loans held-for-sale   | $ (44)           | $ (79)           | $ (14)           |\n| Loans and leases (1)  | (60)             | (73)             | (81)             |\n| Foreclosed properties | (2)              | (6)              | (9)              |\n| Other assets          | (492)            | (98)             | (2,145)          |",

Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation's public side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management's view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the credit derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair value option. These loans are actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through the use of derivatives. The Corporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at fair value. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.\n\n## Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option. These elections include certain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and its agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk.\n\n## Long-term Deposits\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.",

Certain loans, deposits, long-term debt, unfunded lending commitments and other financial instruments are accounted for under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 -Fair Value Option . The following disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Short-term Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, certain time deposits placed and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain resale and repurchase agreements and short-term borrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to\n\nlimited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have shortterm maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market. The Corporation accounts for certain resale and repurchase agreements under the fair value option.\n\nUnder the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1. Time deposits placed and other shortterm investments, such as U.S. government securities and short-term commercial paper, are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Federal funds sold and purchased are classified as Level 2. Resale and repurchase agreements are classified as Level 2 because they are generally short-dated and/or variable-rate instruments collateralized by U.S. government or agency securities. Short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying values and fair values by fair value hierarchy of certain financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance was carried at fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the following table.",

Consumer Banking product offerings include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and products, as well as credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans.\n\n## Global Wealth & Investment Management\n\nGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets, including tailored solutions to meet clients' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.\n\n## Global Banking\n\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through the Corporation's network of offices and client\n\nrelationship teams. Global Banking also provides investment banking products to clients. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nGlobal Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets also works with commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products. As a result of marketmaking activities, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products. In addition, the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.\n\n## All Other\n\nAll Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to the business segments.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.\n\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of the Corporation's ALM activities.\n\nThe Corporation's ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of",

ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation's internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.\n\nCertain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.\n\nEffective October 1, 2021, a business activity previously included in the Global Markets segment is being reported as a liquidating business in All Other , consistent with a realignment\n\nin performance reporting to senior management. While this activity was not material to Global Markets' results of operations and historical results have not been restated, this activity's noninterest expense of $309 million and $473 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021 was elevated and would have been excluded from Global Markets' results of operations for those periods under the new basis of presentation.\n\nThe table below presents net income (loss) and the components thereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis for the business segments, All Other and the total Corporation) for

The Corporation identifies its geographic performance based on the business unit structure used to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region\n\nas applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately matched with the related capital or expense deployed in the region.

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nAlt-A Mortgage -A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or 'prime,' and less risky than 'subprime,' the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.\n\nAssets Under Management (AUM) -The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets' market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.\n\nBanking Book -All onand off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.\n\nBrokerage and Other Assets -Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.\n\nCommitted Credit Exposure -Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.\n\nCredit Derivatives -Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations.\n\nCredit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) -A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.\n\nDebit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) -A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation's own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/ or structured liabilities.\n\nFunding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) -A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives.\n\nInterest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) -Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.\n\nLetter of Credit -A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer.\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) -A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.\n\nMargin Receivable -An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.\n\nMatched Book -Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) -The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.\n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases -Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) -A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: 'well capitalized,' 'adequately capitalized,' 'undercapitalized,' 'significantly undercapitalized' and 'critically undercapitalized.' Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions.\n\nSubprime Loans -Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) -Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) -VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.",
