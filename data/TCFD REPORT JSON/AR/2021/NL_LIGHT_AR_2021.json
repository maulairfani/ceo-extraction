We safeguarded the health and well-being of our employees and minimized supply chain disruptions to our customers while further improving our financial profile. We continued to strengthen our growth profile and remain on course to double our positive impact on the environment and society.' - Eric Rondolat, Signify CEO\n\n2021 presented us with extraordinary challenges brought on by the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, namely high levels of disruption to global supply chains. We navigated these challenges well and successfully minimized the impact on our customers. The continued health crisis sharpened our focus on the welfare of our employees and in 2021 we went to considerable lengths to protect their physical and mental health, and ensure their wellbeing. I take great pride that amid these challenges, we continued to make progress on our journey to double our positive impact on the environment and society.\n\nWe are encouraged by the high demand for connected lighting and for our growth platforms. They accounted for one quarter of our business in 2021. While global supply chain issues impeded our ability to meet the high demand, most notably in Q3, our sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreturned to growth on a comparable basis. By swiftly taking multiple mitigating actions and simultaneously managing our prices to offset the structural part of inflation, we further improved our profitability and ensured continued investment in our digital initiatives. And once again, we generated a solid free cash flow. All of these demonstrate that the fundamentals of our business are stronger than ever, driven by the ever-growing need for energy-efficient and digital lighting technologies.\n\n## Our strategic focus\n\nOur teams have rigorously executed our strategy while adapting to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent supply chain disruptions. Our strategic direction has been reinforced around our 5 Frontiers, which focuses on being even more customer centric, delivering differentiated offers, driving growth for sustainability,\n\ndigitalizing and transforming for the future, and being a great place to work.\n\nIn 2021, we further adapted our company structure by moving to a leaner central organization. At the same time, we achieved cost saving measures while increasing our focus on innovation and sustainability. Overall performance improved despite the troubled external environment:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable sales growth was 3.8%, driven by our digital divisions\n- \u00b7 Our connected lighting sales represented 20% of total sales by the end of the year, increasing our total connected light points to 96 million globally\n- \u00b7 Our adjusted EBITA margin improved by 90 basis points to 11.6%\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow amounted to EUR 614 million, representing 8.9% of sales",

        "page_content": "## Our acquisitions\n\nIn 2021, we strengthened our business with two acquisitions. In the summer we announced the acquisition of Telensa Holdings Limited (Telensa), a UK-based expert in wireless monitoring and control systems for smart cities. The acquisition supports our strategic priority to grow in professional systems and services and broadens the group of customers we can serve. Telensa adds a narrow-band and TALQ-compliant solution to our feature-rich, open and secured systems. Together, we can help towns and cities around the globe reap the benefits of connected lighting in a costefficient way by utilizing the unlicensed radio space, bringing them into a smart city central management system.\n\nAnd just before the end of the year we announced our intended acquisition of Fluence for USD 272 million, to strengthen our Agriculture lighting growth platform in North America. This acquisition enables us to capture the full potential of the US market for bio-based and non-bio-based crops, building on our strong existing European footprint. We expect the global market for agricultural lighting to grow by more than 20% per year to EUR 1.6 billion in 2024.\n\n## Our financial performance\n\nIn 2021, our business continued to recover from the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Strong demand for connected lighting, paired with a solid performance of our growth platforms, underpinned this\n\nrecovery. And while global component shortages and logistics challenges affected our ability to meet the high demand, we still managed to record comparable sales growth of 3.8%. The mitigating actions we took, in combination with disciplined price management to offset inflation, enabled us to improve the Adjusted EBITA margin for the eighth consecutive year. And we once again generated a solid free cash flow of EUR 614 million.\n\nFurther cost optimizations, including in our head office, have reduced our adjusted indirect costs to 29.6% of sales. At the same time, the rigorous execution of our strategy and continued investments in our digital initiatives further improved our competitiveness in a rapidly moving lighting industry.\n\n## Our commitment to innovation\n\nIn 2021, we invested 4.1% of our sales in R&D, focusing on three pillars: innovating in lighting technology, bringing the Internet of Things (IoT) into lighting, and innovating in our growth areas.\n\nIn lighting technology, we launched the Philips Ultra Efficient LED lamp, which is 60% more energy-efficient than other LED lamps, and the Philips TrueForce LED highbay, a universal HID replacement lamp that enables fast and hassle-free conversion to LED for our B2B customers.\n\nIn consumer IoT, we upgraded the Philips Hue experience with a deep Spotify integration\n\nand a more intuitive app with enhanced functionality. For professional customers, we added new capabilities to our Interact Pro system, enabling gateway-less commissioning of Interact Ready luminaires, sensors and switches. Together, these contributed to boosting the installed base of connected light points by 19 million to 96 million.\n\nIn our Growth areas, our efforts to standardize UV-C safety requirements around the globe were rewarded with DEKRA certification for our UV-C desk lamp, a first in our industry. We further extended our 3D printing capabilities to design unique, one-ofa-kind luminaires to customers' specifications. Our fast, secure LiFi connectivity solution was deployed for the first time in commercial aircraft, and at the World Forum in The Hague, where privacy and security are top priorities. And finally, we launched BrightSites, a new industry-leading innovation that can create a high-speed wireless communication backhaul network using our luminaires.\n\nI am extremely proud that our teams' efforts in innovation continue to be recognized. We improved our position in the European Patent Office's World Top 100 Most innovative Companies to 21st, ranked 36th on the IP GREEN100, and our long legacy in design received 40 world-class awards, including 12 iF and 11 Red Dot awards.\n\n## Our commitment to sustainability\n\nIt is integral to our Five Frontiers strategy that our growth must not be at the expense\n\nof the earth, but to its benefit. Our strategy identifies five domains for innovative and sustainable growth: contributing to climate action, contributing to a circular economy, increasing food availability, enhancing safety and security, and improving health and wellbeing.\n\nOur ambitious sustainability program, Brighter Lives, Better World 2025, builds on our 2020 achievement of carbon neutrality in our operations. Through this program, we will amplify our positive impact by enabling our customers and suppliers to become more sustainable. I am proud to say for all our commitments we are on track to double our positive impact on the environment and society by the end of 2025.\n\nThis year, we accelerated our actions to combat climate change and I would like to mention a few highlights. We launched our Green Switch program in Europe and our Brighten America program in the US to connect the dots between climate action and economic growth. We announced our most energy-efficient commercial light bulb ever, and we are on track to deliver against our ambitious goal of doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5 \u1d52 scenario. In 2021, we were at the top of the DJSI World Index for the fifth consecutive year and ranked in the top 1% of our industry according to Sustainalytics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To fulfil this promise, we have continued to build the strong digital and excellence capabilities that improve customer experience and business processes. Our progress was rewarded with multiple awards at the annual European Customer Centricity Awards 2021, most notably the gold medal for statistics modelling.\n\nWe have further strengthened our quality standards and started a competency development program within our design and manufacturing environment to improve quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nAs part of our continued journey towards organizational excellence, we used the European Foundation of Quality Management (EFQM) model to assess another ten markets and businesses. 20% of all assessed entities achieved a score of more than 500 points, demonstrating an indisputable track record of success in turning strategy into action and their commitment to performance excellence,\n\nwhich brings them closer to being 'Best in class' organizations.\n\nWhile structural improvements are tangible, we have not been able to deliver to our customers at the expected levels given the overall disruption in the global supply chain. Indeed, 2021 was a disruptive year for our supply chain, which was hit by a global transportation crisis, a heavily volatile raw materials market, and global components scarcity. All our teams, in every geography, anticipated and adapted to the changing environments with a single priority: minimizing disruption to our customers.\n\n## Our digitalization journey\n\nThe supply chain disruptions also emphasized even more the importance of our ongoing digitalization journey. Improving end-to-end visibility within the full value chain will help us respond even faster to customer demand and changing market environments, as our customers have a growing interest in engaging with us through digital channels.\n\nIn 2021, digital sales via our B2C channels increased by 53.6%. We have pivoted to an Agile delivery model with strong market focus to further accelerate and strengthen our customer interfaces. Our teams continue to have daily interaction with our customers, learn, and further develop new features for our digital channels.\n\nWe made solid progress in digitalizing operations this year. In Digital Supply chain, we have improved Demand, Supply and Inventory Optimization processes, increasing our service levels. In Digital Manufacturing, we have digitalized, standardized and automated much of our product handling and inventory management, increasing visibility and productivity in our warehouses.\n\nTo ensure synergies in our strategy and delivery model, we consolidated our global Digital organization to merge the three pillars of our digital transformation - Digital, Data and IT- under a single leader. We will continue to strengthen the digital organization with strategic leadership hires.\n\n## Our commitment to being a great place to work\n\nIn 2021, the physical and mental health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families remained a priority. To help provide our employees with a safe working environment, we started installing UV-C disinfection devices in 138 projects in our offices and buildings.\n\nA diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment are essential to a thriving, innovative business. This year we will publish our first annual Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) report. And as part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program, we increased our ambitions on diversity, equity and inclusion, committing ourselves to double the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34% by the end of 2025. We further aim to achieve 40-60% gender balance targets for the management and professional levels of our organization by 2025.\n\nAs an employer, we take pride and encouragement from the external",

Most recently, Equileap recognized us as one of the ten leading companies in the Netherlands on workplace equality and placed us second in gender equality in the supply chain.

This year, our customers and employees improved their skills during multiple virtual sessions.\n\nOur robust succession plans for leadership roles have resulted in greater diversity in our candidate pool, with 36% of succession candidates being women. In 2021, over 80% of our leadership positions were staffed internally, confirming the success of our efforts to build a strong internal succession pipeline.\n\nThis year, keeping people and teams connected has been both important and challenging. Our quarterly employee survey has thus proven particularly insightful. Employee NPS showed a continued improvement, from 25 in 2020 to 30 in 2021, with 80-85% participation levels throughout the year.\n\n## Our thanks\n\nOn behalf of our Board of Management and our entire leadership team, I want to thank our employees, who continue to show tremendous dedication, creativity and resilience and each day fulfil our purpose to unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world.\n\nI also thank our customers for their trust and loyalty, especially during these challenging times.

We also wanted to work on a warehouse design which would showcase the latest connected lighting technologies. We decided to partner with DHL Supply Chain because we share many of the same corporate values and a vision on digitalization and sustainability. From the outset, it was clear that our partnership had the potential to go beyond a single warehouse to bring value to other similar facilities.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe first replaced the old fluorescent-tube lighting with LED high bay luminaires, which consume only about half of the energy. We cocreated a smart warehouse lighting system where all the luminaires are wirelessly monitored, managed and controlled by Interact Industry, bringing additional benefits in terms of shopfloor usage optimization, workers' safety, and productivity improvements.\n\nWe offered DHL Supply Chain the latest and most transformative industrial lighting technology and related services, putting it all to work as part of a pilot program at a DHL Supply Chain site in Lockbourne, Ohio.\n\n'We are shooting for a millionkilowatt hours savings in this system on an annual basis. Right now, that's exactly where we're tracking today.\" Marty Reibold General Manager Technology, DHL Supply Chain\n\nFollowing this initial success, DHL Supply Chain plans to use the advanced capabilities of Interact Industry's connected infrastructure to drive several key initiatives. We're already working together to expand on the success of the pilot at other DHL Supply Chain sites.\n\n## Interact Industry\n\nInteract Industry is a cloud-based connected lighting system that supports new operational efficiencies and centralizes lighting management. The capabilities of Interact Industry go far beyond illumination. For example, the scene management capabilities are ideal for managing different lighting needs in different parts of a facility. DHL Supply Chain created 75 zones each with unique lighting characteristics managed centrally by Interact Industry. This improved productivity and employee satisfaction and well-being at the Lockbourne site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInteract Industry - DHL Supply Chain - US\n\n<!-- image -->",

Apps offered this service by accessing the microphone on users' devices to sense and respond to the music.\n\nThis meant that the lights would always respond to the music instead of working in sync. And simply taking a voice call could disrupt the experience, since the lights would respond to background noise picked up by the microphone.\n\nAs Philips Hue wants to provide its Hue users the best possible smart home lighting experience, it set out to find a more sophisticated way to match light and music.\n\n## Solution\n\nSpotify and Signify brought together their world-leading expertise in music streaming and smart lighting to create a solution that seamlessly unites light and audio, without using the microphone. Philips Hue users can simply pair their Spotify account directly within the Philips Hue app.\n\nOnce paired, a new, jointly-developed algorithm analyzes the metadata of each song in real time, translating digital music into digital lighting.\n\nLights flash, dim and change color according to the song's beat, mood, genre and tempo. Users can set their personal preferences on how lights respond, including setting their own color palettes, within the Philips Hue app.\n\nAnd since the system bypasses the microphone, people can use their phone to do other things at the same time.\n\n## Philips Hue + Spotify value proposition\n\nThe world's leading audio streaming subscription service meets the world's leading smart home lighting platform.\n\nPhilips Hue + Spotify is a unique deep music and lighting integration that makes the world's best loved light and music apps work together in perfect harmony.\n\nWhen Spotify and Philips Hue are connected, Philips Hue can match its lights to any song on Spotify, so people can hear, see and feel the music like never before.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of its strategy to combat climate change, Colombia's International Airport Operator (OPAIN) wanted to find innovative lighting solutions that would reduce the airport's carbon footprint while improving the visual comfort of passengers and employees.\n\nOne initiative involved the retrofitting of interior luminaires to ensure lighting had a more positive impact on the environment. As terminals are 24/7 transit points, it was a priority to enhance visual comfort for passengers and workspace visibility for airport staff.\n\n## Solution\n\nIn a first phase, Signify provided El Dorado airport with nearly 9.000 3D-printed downlights. 3D-printed luminaires can be made to the customer's precise specifications, have a 75% lower carbon footprint than a conventionally-made metal fixture, and can be reused or recycled, supporting a circular economy.\n\nOPAIN also retrofitted more than 14,000 luminaires to LEDs, helping to reduce the airport's electricity consumption by 51%. With 68% of the airport's emissions, excluding air traffic, coming from electricity consumption, this significantly reduces its carbon footprint.\n\nOutdoors, Signify installed Digistreet luminaires, which have been integrated with Interact City, our connected lighting system.\n\nInteract's lighting management dashboard enables the airport operators to adapt lighting levels quickly and easily. They can remotely monitor, manage and control each light point individually, from any location. This extra visibility means that preventative maintenance and resolution of faults can be dealt with quickly, reducing maintenance costs, improving the passenger experience, and minimizing disruption to operations.\n\n'Our goal is to be a benchmark in energy efficiency and sustainable operations in Colombia and Latin America. For this reason, we're excited to have installed the latest innovation in lighting with 3D printed downlights and to be the regional pioneer when it comes to remote management of the lighting infrastructure.' Mauricio V\u00e9lez OPAIN's Infrastructure Manager\n\n## 3D-printed downlights\n\nOur 3D-printed luminaries are built with sustainability in mind. The base material is a polycarbonate that is strong, high-quality and 100% recyclable. Each order can be custom designed and tailored to the client's needs, saving time, energy, waste in manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The process illustrates that more complex and innovative designs can be aligned with the needs of a circular economy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

But in rural India, a lack of adequate lighting in playgrounds often means that playtime ends when the sun goes down. Girls, in particular, are hesitant to practice sports after sunset as a lack of adequate lighting makes them feel unsafe.\n\nGovernment schools in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh wanted to improve playground lighting to extend sports time beyond daytime breaks, positively impacting the lives of local children.\n\n## Solution\n\nWorking with our NGO partner in India, the SRF Foundation, Signify India donated high mast poles with solar-powered flood lights to illuminate five badminton courts and playgrounds in rural government schools in Uttar Pradesh. So far, some 1,285 children have benefited from the project.\n\nAs a direct outcome, student's daily practice time has been extended and their sports skills have improved.\n\nThe number of players now qualifying for district and state-level badminton competitions has increased significantly.\n\nSchools are reporting higher enrollment numbers and lower drop out numbers, which in part can be attributed to other children who are not enrolled in the school coming to play in the lit-up playground. Girls at the schools now feel safer and can participate and improve their skills under the new lights. Parents say they also feel more confident sending their children to sports practice and are more satisfied with their children's development.\n\n## Solar-powered flood lights\n\nThe solar-powered flood lights were specifically designed to support the needs of the government schools in India. The flood lights are connected to a battery, which can fully charge in seven hours of direct sunlight (depending on weather conditions) and which then provides three hours of lighting.\n\nAdditionally, the flood lights are not connected to the electricity grid, making the installation as easy as attaching the flood lights to the mast poles, digging a hole for each of the mast poles and installing the flood lights, before powering them up by connecting to the solar panels installed on the roof of the school. This provides the government schools with a very straightforward solution that harnesses the power of the sun to extend practice time beyond sunset, and one that can be replicated easily in and beyond India.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolar-powered flood lights - Govt.

On top of that, consumers are increasingly concerned about the origins, farming methods, and nutritional profile of their food. To address these concerns, farmers must increasingly look to innovation and technology to change the way they plan and cultivate their crops. Establishing local growing facilities situated closer to urban areas to reduce the pressure on resources has been a long-time dream of many.\n\nInnovative produce company Kalera is one of the first to address these issues head on, and on a large scale. Kalera's futuristic indoor vertical farms grow clean, fresh, high-quality leafy greens with reduced environmental impact. The farms are not dependent on the outdoor climate, can operate anywhere reducing how far our food needs to travel before arriving on our plates, and limiting associated costs and emissions - and can function without the need for pesticides or fertilizers. To take farming indoors, Kalera sought a technology partner able to provide a wide range of solutions and enable them to scale in support of their ambitious growth plans.\n\n## Solution\n\nIn 2018, Kalera opened its first facility, the 3,000 square foot HyCube Growing Center, at the Orlando World Center Marriott, equipped with our Philips-branded horticultural lighting. Since then, Kalera has announced an additional\n\nseven locations in the US, from Houston, Texas to Honolulu, Hawaii, all powered by Philips GreenPower LED production modules. The new facilities are expected to collectively produce more than 70 million heads of lettuce per year.\n\nKey to the success of the project is a deeply collaborative approach between Signify and Kalera team members. Precision control over the plants' lighting conditions creates the perfect growing conditions for each plant and has even been shown to optimize the nutritional profile of the resulting crop. Thanks to this innovative approach, Kalera's yields are 300 - 400 times that of traditional farms.\n\n## Philips GreenPower LEDs\n\nFor professional growers, Signify offers the Philips GreenPower LED range, which includes different toplighting and interlighting luminaires, flowering lamps, and production modules. The production module is an energyefficient solution designed specifically for year-round indoor crop cultivation and is dimmable and color controllable when combined with Philips GrowWise Control Systems. Connecting the two technologies enables growers like Kalera to develop, test and apply their own custom light recipes. These custom light recipes can be designed to steer specific plant characteristics, such as compactness, color intensity, branch development, and/or flowering, and ultimately deliver a better and more predictable yield and improved crop quality.\n\n<!-- image -->",

But for popular restaurant group TTFB, operator of restaurant chains including Thai Town Cuisine, Very Thai Restaurant and Shann Rice Bar, it was certainly not a case of business as usual.\n\nCustomers were wary of removing their masks indoors and socializing in proximity to other diners. TTFB was eager to find a solution that would provide a high level of protection for its customers and staff and help people recapture the joy of evenings out.\n\n## Solution\n\nIn the first phase, Signify equipped 34 of TTFB's restaurants with UV-C disinfection technology. We installed two to three Philips UV-C disinfection upper air wall-mounted units in the dining areas of each restaurant, as well as three Philips UV-C disinfection battens with sensors in each of the kitchens. We also installed eight Philips UV-C disinfection upper air ceiling-mounted units in TTFB's head offices in New Taipei.\n\nTo ensure the restaurants could continue to serve their customers during regular hours, the installation work took place after the restaurants closed their doors, usually around midnight.\n\nTTFB's management has been very satisfied with the result and in 2022 began extending the solution to another 46 restaurants, with a potential to equip all of its 132 restaurants, setting a new standard as one of Taiwan's leading restaurant chains.\n\n\"We have chosen Signify with its innovative UV-C disinfection solution to increase the safety for our customers and staff.' David Huang Construction Director, TTFB Restaurant Group\n\n## Philips UV-C disinfection\n\nUV-C disinfection lighting has been in use for more than 40 years. It can play a crucial role in limiting the spread of viruses and bacteria by disinfecting the air, surfaces and objects. Philips UV-C disinfection upper air luminaires distribute UV-C rays at device level and above. Their high position, in combination with the shielding and optics that are embedded in the luminaires' design, allow the units to quietly and discreetly disinfect the air while customers dine below. Philips UV-C disinfection battens provide homogenous disinfection over a specific area, making them ideal for inactivating viruses and germs on kitchen surfaces.\n\nThis combination of UV-C disinfection solutions offers restaurant owners peace of mind in a world that's adjusting to a new normal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUV-C disinfection lighting - TTFB restaurant - New Taipei - Taiwan\n\n<!-- image -->",

To successfully host the event, the nation needed to upgrade existing venues and even build some new arenas. This also involved installing high-quality lighting to ensure athletes would have the best visibility as they strive for eternal honor, while spectators and TV viewers wouldn't miss any of the action. Each venue posed its own challenges, including steep rocky hills, long-distance signal transmission, and ice surfaces that reflect lights. Additionally, operators wanted the ability and flexibility to manage the lighting in different areas from a single dashboard.\n\n## Solution\n\nSignify equipped major outdoor and indoor venues with LEDs from the Philips SportStar and ArenaVision series and controlled by Interact Sports. This includes the venues for biathlon, ski jumping, freestyle skiing and snowboarding, speed skating, short-track skating, and ice hockey. At Genting Snow Park, where freestyle skiing and snowboarding will take place, we ensured we would meet the high-speed dynamic lighting control needs at night to perfectly capture all the moves of the athletes. At Capital Indoor Stadium, the lighting fixtures have the same level of high-speed refresh rate as the stage lighting, making the ice look at its\n\nbest and enhancing the viewing experience. At Wukesong Sports Centre, China's first that can host basketball and ice hockey events, our lights meet the latest broadcasting standards for the best TV viewing experience. We also equipped the event's main arena with our Interact Sports connected lighting system, ensuring the best lighting effects, and optimizing fan, broadcasting and viewer experience during the diverse events hosted there. Interact Sport's unique scenemanagement capabilities also allow technicians to create an exciting viewing experience for spectators, extending their excitement before, during and after events.\n\n## Philips SportStar and ArenaVision\n\nLED floodlights from the Philips SportStar and ArenaVision series are tailor-made for the specific requirements of sports venues. They provide high power and high color rendering features, which, in combination with a variety of light distribution solutions, can achieve the highest level of color reproduction and flicker control. This helps athletes to better engage in their sports and enhances their performance. It also meets the stringent requirements of international television broadcasters, supporting flicker-free super slow-motion replay, and allowing TV viewers around the globe to have an immersive athletic viewing experience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Like many towns, Pepperell, Massachusetts, was still using high-pressure sodium lighting throughout the town. The Town of Pepperell began looking for a solution that could help reduce its energy consumption, while keeping its citizens safe after sunset. While most people are familiar with air and water pollution, light can also be a pollutant. As a Dark Sky-friendly community, Pepperell was looking for lighting that minimizes light pollution, reducing effects known as 'glare', 'skyglow' and 'trespass'. Typical LED fixtures provide cooler color temperatures (CCTs), which can contribute more to skyglow compared to warmer CCTs. As a result, warmer CCTs are necessary for Dark Sky compliance.\n\n## Solution\n\nCooper Lighting provided a solution that met all of Pepperell's desires, replacing all of the town's 409 high-pressure sodium light fixtures with LED light fixtures from the Streetworks Archeon Series. These Archeon LED luminaires reduce the town's total system wattage by over 80%; with greater than USD 80,000 in estimated maintenance savings and more than USD 800,000 in total savings estimated over a 10-year period. 1 And because the LED light fixtures of the Streetworks Archeon Series can deliver a lower color\n\ntemperature than other LED light fixtures, they reduce glare, skyglow and light trespass. This makes them perfect for the City of Pepperell to achieve its Dark Sky-friendly goals.\n\n'Pepperell is strongly committed to climate change issues and considered converting to LEDs as an opportunity to reduce energy consumption. We have also declared ourselves a Dark Sky-friendly community and strive to eliminate unneeded nighttime lighting. This conversion reduces nighttime lighting and glare without compromising the public safety benefits of street lighting.' Andrew MacLean Town Administrator, Town of Pepperell\n\n## Streetworks Archeon Series\n\nThe Streetworks Archeon Series delivers all the performance benefits of the latest LED platforms and technologies with a modern yet familiar cobrahead form factor. With a U0 uplight rating and a CCT offering of 2200K 6000K, the Archeon series is designed to meet any Dark Sky specification, positively impacting both humans and wildlife.\n\n1 Assumptions: 10-hour daily run rate, 0.2223 KWH average rate\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCooper Lighting Streetworks Archeon Series - Pepperell, Massachusetts - US\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the first half of the year, vaccination rollouts led to an easing of lockdowns in many parts of the world, though throughout the second half of the year restrictions were reinstated as new variants caused a resurgence of the virus in many regions.\n\nIn addition, component and container shortages, together with other logistics challenges, impacted Signify's ability to deliver. As underlying demand remained healthy, this resulted in part of the orders being delayed. To cope with these supply challenges, we utilized the spot market for both components and containers, we redesigned our products to include more readily available components, and we qualified new component suppliers.\n\nAn additional consequence of the global supply disruption was the resurgence of significant inflation. In light of these rising input costs, we moved to pass on cost inflation to our customers, thereby limiting the impact on the bottom line.\n\nIn this context, we reported sales of EUR 6,860 million, delivered a comparable sales growth of 3.8%, improved our Adjusted EBITA margin by 90 basis points to 11.6%, increased net income from EUR 335 million in 2020 to\n\nEUR 407 million, and delivered net cash from operating activities of EUR 704 million.\n\nDespite the challenging macro environment, we reported a sales increase of 5.5% on a nominal basis. Adjusted for (2.0)% currency effects, and 3.6% consolidation and other changes, comparable sales increased by 3.8%. The growth was mainly driven by strong consumer and professional demand for connected products and growth platforms. LED-based sales represented 83% of total sales (2020: 80%).\n\nOur gross margin was EUR 2,671 million in 2021 compared to EUR 2,499 million in 2020. The adjusted gross margin increased to EUR 2,702 million from EUR 2,556 million in 2020. As a percentage of sales, the adjusted gross margin increased by 10 basis points to 39.4%, which includes a negative currency effect of 20 basis points. Price increases, positive sales mix and the carryover of bill of material savings in the first half of the year more than compensated for higher input and logistics costs.\n\nIndirect costs increased to EUR 2,168 million, an increase of EUR 80 million over 2020. Adjusted indirect costs increased by EUR 50 million to EUR 2,032. As a percentage of sales, adjusted indirect costs decreased by 90 basis points to 29.6%, driven by operating leverage and structural cost savings.\n\nR&D expenses were EUR 286 million, compared to EUR 307 million in 2020. Adjusted for restructuring and acquisition related charges, R&D expenses declined by EUR 3 million to EUR 284 million. As a percentage of sales, adjusted R&D expenses decreased from 4.4% in 2020 to 4.1% in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "EBITA and Adjusted EBITA both increased by EUR 100 million to EUR 636 million and EUR 795 million, respectively. The Adjusted EBITA margin improved by 90 basis points to 11.6%, including a negative currency effect of 20 basis points. This improvement was the combined result of the higher gross margin and operating leverage.\n\nIncome from operations increased from EUR 416 million in 2020 to EUR 514 million in 2021. This included EUR 86 million of restructuring expenses (mostly related to the restructuring of the central organization), EUR 50 million of acquisition-related charges and EUR 22 million of incidental items. These are nonrecurring items in nature related to, among other items, separation costs, transformation initiatives, real-estate gains, environmental provisions for inactive sites and the effect of changes in discount rates on long-term provisions.\n\nNet income was EUR 407 million compared to EUR 335 million in 2020, as higher income from operations and lower net financial expenses were only partly offset by a higher income tax expense (2020 included higher non-cash tax benefits from the revaluation of deferred tax assets).\n\nCompared to 2020, working capital decreased by EUR 63 million to EUR 250 million, driven by higher payables and lower other working capital items, which more than offset higher inventories, and receivables. The high level of inventories was the result of longer order lead times and increased safety stock levels. As a percentage of sales, working capital improved by 120 basis points\n\nto 3.6%. When including pro-forma last twelve-month sales for Cooper Lighting, working capital as a percentage of sales improved by 110 basis points.\n\nNet cash from operating activities decreased by EUR 187 million to EUR 704 million, as 2021 working capital was impacted by continued supply chain constraints, while 2020 benefited from both a release of working capital due to sales decline and the implementation of structural working capital improvements. Net capital expenditures increased to EUR 91 million, resulting in a free cash flow of EUR 614 million or 8.9% of sales.\n\nShareholders' equity increased to EUR 2,459 million, reflecting the net income and currency translation results, offset by the dividend payment and share repurchases.\n\nNet debt was EUR 1,156 million at year-end 2021, a reduction of EUR 119 million compared to year-end 2020. This reduction was mainly driven by a solid free cash flow generation, partly offset by dividend payments. Gross debt decreased, primarily driven by the repayment of EUR 350 million, as committed.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, Signify had a postemployment liability of EUR 363 million, compared to EUR 390 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease is mostly driven by the payment of benefits and the yearly actuarial remeasurement.\n\nSignify employed 36,824 full-time equivalents (FTEs) at year-end 2021, compared with 37,926 at year-end 2020.\n\n## 4.1.2 Performance by Division\n\n## Performance Digital Solutions\n\n## About Digital Solutions\n\nSignify is the world leader in the professional lighting market for such products as LED and systems and services, with strong positions across key geographies.

Signify operated nine manufacturing plants for conventional lamps at the end of 2021 compared with 11 at the end of 2020.\n\n## 2021 Financial performance\n\nSales were EUR 861 million, a nominal decline of 8.7% versus 2020. On a comparable basis, sales declined by 6.9%. A lower rate of decline compared with 2020, mainly as a result of the market recovery and traction across most of its segments.\n\nIncome from operations increased to EUR 158 million, helped by lower restructuring expenses. Adjusted EBITA declined by 5.0% to EUR 161 million while Adjusted EBITA margin improved by 70 basis points to 18.7%, mostly driven by indirect cost savings. The Division generated a robust free cash flow of EUR 136 million.\n\n## Market developments\n\nSignify estimates that the conventional lighting market declined at a faster pace than its Conventional Products business in 2021 and thus continued to gain market share.\n\nThe conventional lamps market is expected to continue to decline in the coming years due to the ongoing adoption of LED lighting technologies and regulatory changes.\n\n## 2022 and beyond\n\nIn 2022, Conventional Products will continue to execute its strategy and optimize free cash flow by leveraging its cost advantage, scale, global footprint and lean manufacturing capabilities, while responding to customer demand for conventional products.\n\n## Performance Other\n\n'Other' represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes certain costs related to central R&D activities to drive innovation, and to group-enabling functions. 'Other' reported income from operations of EUR (165) million and EBITA of EUR (164) million. This includes restructuring costs of EUR 58 million, which were mostly related to the restructuring of the central organization and a negative impact from incidental items of EUR 4 million. Adjusted EBITA was EUR (102) million in 2021, versus EUR (100) million in 2020. The number of FTEs was 339 at the end of 2021, versus 589 at the end of 2020, mainly as a result of the restructuring of the central organization.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The remainder of the net income, after reservations made with the approval of the Supervisory Board, shall be available for distribution to holders of ordinary shares subject to shareholder approval after yearend. As of December 31, 2021, the issued share capital consists only of ordinary shares; no preference shares have been issued. Under Article 10 of the Articles of Association of Signify N.V., the Board of Management can determine what portion of the net income shall be retained by way of reserve, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nSignify proposes to declare a cash dividend of EUR 1.45 per share for 2021. The dividend proposal will be subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) to be held on May 17, 2022.\n\nThe balance sheet presented in this report, as part of the company financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2021, is before appropriation of the result for the financial year 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.4 Outlook\n\nAs Signify continues to proactively navigate through the gradually improving component and logistics environment, it provides the following outlook for 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable sales growth in the range of 3-6%\n- \u00b7 Continued Adjusted EBITA margin improvement of up to 50 basis points\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow in excess of 8% of sales\n\n## 4.5 Competitive landscape\n\nThe lighting market is a fragmented market across technologies, products and geographies. Companies active in the market include traditional lighting companies as well as companies, mainly based in Asia, that entered the market with the advent of LED technology. The introduction of connected lighting brought new competitors to the market.\n\nWhile Signify is active in 74 countries, competition in the market for lamps tends to be more global while competition in the market for luminaires is more regional in nature. The market for conventional lighting is declining and competitor focus is on managing this decline. The market for LED lighting continues to grow and sees competition around product offerings, customer use cases, pricing and innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a Supervisory Board, we closely followed these developments. We appreciate how the company's leadership addressed the challenges posed by the current external environment. In financial terms, even in this challenging environment the company was able to achieve a solid financial performance in 2021. At the same time, the company progressed on its ambitious sustainability commitments under its second five-year sustainability program, Brighter Lives, Better World 2025.\n\nAs a Supervisory Board, we are actively involved in the strategic direction of the company which is centered around 5 Frontiers to build a customer-centric organization, deliver differentiating lighting offers, drive growth for sustainability, digitalize and transform for the future, and be a great place to work. We are satisfied with the progress made in 2021 towards delivering on the company's strategy.\n\n## Arthur van der Poel\n\nChair of the Supervisory Board\n\n## 8.1 Introduction\n\nThis report provides information on how the Supervisory Board and its committees fulfilled their duties in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, the composition of our Supervisory Board remained unchanged. In May 2021, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders reappointed Gerard van de Aast. The Supervisory Board currently consists of six independent members.\n\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board had four committees that cover key areas in greater detail: an Audit Committee, a Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, a Remuneration Committee, and a Digital Committee. The charters of each of the committees are published on the company's website.\n\n8.2\n\n## Key discussion topics and meetings in 2021\n\n## Meetings and information\n\nThe Supervisory Board held eight meetings in 2021 and had additional calls on ad hoc topics, such as on the announced intended acquisition of the US-based company Fluence. While we were able to organize inperson meetings three times, in view of COVID-19, most meetings were held via video conference. We learned that working and meeting remotely can be done well, even for",

At the same time, we realized the benefits of meeting in person, so we hope that this will again be possible more often in 2022.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and committee meetings were well attended, with an attendance rate of 100% of each Supervisory Board member, except for one committee meeting by one of its members.\n\nEach of the Supervisory Board committees regularly convened and reported back on their activities to the full Supervisory Board. In addition, the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the CEO are in regular contact on a variety of matters. Our members also individually interacted with members of the Board of Management and with senior management outside the formal Supervisory Board meetings. From time to time, Supervisory Board members wanted to be informed on, or discuss, a specific topic. This was then followed-up by a member of the Board of Management or senior management.\n\nThere were no apparent conflicts of interest of material significance in 2021, which would have called for one of the members not to participate in the decision-making.\n\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board discussed a range of topics, including:\n\n## \u00b7 COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact in 2021, and became part of the standing agenda. Throughout 2021, the Supervisory Board was kept updated on developments around COVID-19, focusing on health & security, procurement, supply chain and manufacturing.

These topics are expected to remain on the Supervisory Board's agenda in 2022.\n\n## \u00b7 Strategy, objectives and innovation\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we had discussions on the company's 5 Frontiers strategy and the commitments of its Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program.\n\nIn September 2021, we had our annual Strategy Review, a session dedicated to the company's strategy towards long-term value creation. As part of this session, we discussed key enterprise risks, reviewed the market developments and trends and their strategic implications, and discussed growth opportunities and the competitive landscape. We looked at the company's progress on strategic initiatives and sustainability goals, as well as the company's strategy for the mid-term and strategic initiatives for 2022. This session was complemented by deep dives on growth, capital allocation and the US market. For each of these deep dives, one\n\nof the Supervisory Board members had been engaged in the preparation of the discussion.\n\nThe Strategy Review was followed by a Strategic Plan discussion in December in which management presented the 2022-2024 strategic plan, including financial objectives. We also discussed and approved the company's financial targets for 2022 within the context of its 2022 operating plan.\n\nIn addition, management updated us on a quarterly basis on the progress made on the company's strategic initiatives for 2021. Throughout the year, we also discussed the market trends, risks and opportunities as well as the strategy, as part of the market and division updates. We have reviewed, challenged, and advised the Board of Management on the company's implementation of its strategic plan and strategic priorities throughout the year.\n\nAs part of the December meeting, we discussed the company's innovation strategy, and the company's innovation\n\ndepartment gave demonstrations of recent and future technologies being developed. The COVID-19 restrictions did not allow for an in-person meeting of the Supervisory Board in December with on-the-ground demonstrations at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven. This was replaced by live videos from, and discussions with, the teams in the Netherlands, China and the United States, showing technologies developed in each of the regions.\n\n## \u00b7 Sustainability\n\nIn September 2020, the company launched its second five-year sustainability program: Brighter Lives, Better World 2025, with a first reporting year in 2021.\n\nThroughout the year, we were updated on the company's progress on the commitments under this program and the company's strategic initiatives for 2021 to drive growth for sustainability. We also had a dedicated sustainability update, as part of which we reviewed the 2021 materiality assessment that is discussed in more detail in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, sub-section 16.1.1, of this Annual Report.",

The Head of Internal Audit is invited to this private session from time to time. The Committee Chair also has regular contact with the CFO, the Head of Internal Audit and the external auditor outside of Committee meetings.\n\nIn 2021, the Audit Committee received well prepared information from management and the external auditor on a variety of topics related to the company's financials, reporting policies, controls, practices, and compliance. As part of its standing agenda, the Audit Committee discussed the company's periodic financial statements and related press releases. With the Head of Internal Audit and the Board of Management, the Committee reviews the internal audits executed in the quarter, their assessment, the areas for improvement and positive developments, and management thereof as well as attention points  identified through internal audits, and progress and effectiveness of associated mitigation actions.

As the risk that goodwill is impaired decreased following the increase in headroom, the external auditor indicated that it no longer regards the valuation of goodwill as a key audit matter.\n\n## \u00b7 EU Taxonomy\n\nAs of 2021, the company will report under the new EU taxonomy reporting framework. The Committee discussed the purpose, the status and the reporting requirements of the EU taxonomy as well as how the company addresses it.

In its reports, the external auditor focused on specific areas and developments. These included the key audit matters, which are described in more detail in the combined independent auditor's report, which is included in chapter 17 of this Annual Report. The external auditor also shared its observations and considerations on management judgement and estimates applied in the preparation of the financial statements. The external auditor discussed their observations during the quarterly Audit Committee meetings.\n\nThe discussions with the external auditors also covered matters related to accounting policies, financial risks, and compliance with accounting standards, as well as compliance with (financial) legal requirements and relevant legal proceedings and related provisions. Other areas of Audit Committee review included the proposed external audit scope, approach, fees and the independence of the external auditor.

The Committee also supervises the policy on the selection and appointment of certain other key management positions.

Various topics are often prepared among the Committee members ahead of a Committee meeting, resulting in efficient decision-making during the meetings.\n\nAs part of its standing agenda, the Committee discussed changes in key personnel positions, succession planning and the functioning of key personnel as well as the Supervisory Board's performance evaluation procedures. In addition, the Committee discussed developments in the Dutch corporate governance landscape and the company's corporate governance structure. It also discussed the Committee's own charter.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee specifically dedicated time to the following matters:\n\n## \u00b7 Composition Supervisory Board\n\n- In 2021, the Committee prepared and led an assessment and selection process that resulted in the proposal by the Supervisory Board to appoint Bram Schot as Supervisory Board member at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) to be held on May 17, 2022. The Supervisory Board recommends Bram Schot in view of his managerial experience and extensive technology knowledge, which he combines with a strong understanding of the\n\nimportance of a customer-centric approach, which we think will provide us with valuable insights. In each selection process, the Committee takes account of the desired board profile, including its diversity policy and expertise and experience as well as the desired board size.\n\nEelco Blok will reach the end of his fouryear term at the AGM 2022, and will then step down as a member of the Supervisory Board at his own request.\n\n## \u00b7 Board size and profile, including diversity\n\n- We believe that it is of strategic importance that our Board of Management and Supervisory Board are composed in line with Dutch and international corporate governance best practices and that they have the expertise needed for a good understanding of current affairs and longer-term risks and opportunities related to the company's business, taking into account our objectives that promote diversity at board level. Our boards' profile and the Supervisory Board skills and expertise matrix reflect the areas that the Committee and Supervisory Board regard to be most relevant to address the transition in the lighting industry and the execution of the company's 5 Frontiers strategy. In 2021, the Committee reviewed the matrix categories and the profile (both updated in 2020), and concluded that these currently do not require a further amendment. In 2021, the skills and expertise matrix was complemented with the publication of expanded biographies of the Supervisory Board members on the company's website.\n\n## Supervisory Board skills and expertise matrix\n\nFields in which the members of the Supervisory Board have a particular skill or expertise\n\n| Skill/experience item       | Arthur  van der Poel   | Gerard  van de  Aast   | Eelco  Blok   | Pamela  Knapp   | Rita  Lane   | Frank  Lubnau   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| CEO role                    | \u00fc                      | \u00fc                      | \u00fc             |                 |              |                 |\n| Industrial experience       | \u00fc                      | \u00fc                      |               | \u00fc               | \u00fc            | \u00fc               |\n| Finance, expert level       |                        | \u00fc                      |               | \u00fc               |              |                 |\n| Sustainability              | \u00fc                      |                        |               | \u00fc               |              |                 |\n| Projects/infrastructure     |                        | \u00fc                      |               |                 |              |                 |\n| Business transformation     | \u00fc                      | \u00fc                      | \u00fc             | \u00fc               |              | \u00fc               |\n| Digital business  processes |                        | \u00fc                      | \u00fc             | \u00fc               | \u00fc            | \u00fc               |\n| IT, cybersecurity           |                        |                        | \u00fc             |                 | \u00fc            | \u00fc               |\n| Technology/innovation       | \u00fc                      |                        | \u00fc             |                 | \u00fc            | \u00fc               |\n| Diversity elements:         | Male                   | Male                   | Male          | Female          | Female       | Male            |\n| Gender, age, nationality    | 73                     | 64                     | 64            | 63              | 59           | 52              |\n|                             | Dutch                  | Dutch                  | Dutch         | German          | American     | German          |\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board was also addressed in the annual performance evaluation (see also below). The Supervisory Board observed that its current size is good, and that the board is balanced, has a good skills base and strong diversity of gender, background and ideas.\n\nBoth the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board comprise of two-third men and one-third women, in line with the company's diversity objectives that at least 30% are men and at least 30% are women on the board. For more details on the profile including diversity of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, please refer to chapter 10, Corporate governance, of this Annual Report. For more information on diversity and inclusion in the company, please refer to chapter 16,\n\nSustainability statements, section 16.3, of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board currently regards its size and composition to be adequate to perform its duties. The Committee will continue to periodically assess its size and composition, including the desired diversity, and initiate searches where indicated.\n\n## \u00b7 ESG committee\n\nWe noted the suggestion from some stakeholders to companies in general to consider establishing an ESG committee from among their supervisory boards to support progress on sustainability. Sustainability has been an integral part of Signify's strategy for many years. The full Supervisory Board is engaged in the strategy, including sustainability. The",

In view of this, we see no need to establish an ESG committee from among the Supervisory Board.\n\n## 8.3.3 R emuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee assists the Supervisory Board by, amongst other matters, reviewing and preparing remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, remuneration proposals for individual members of the Board of Management and other key management positions, as well as proposals for targets relevant to the variable compensation of members of the Board of Management and the review of their performance.\n\nGerard van de Aast (Chair), Pamela Knapp and Arthur van der Poel are the members of this Committee. Currently, no member of the Remuneration Committee is a member of the executive management board of another listed company.\n\nIn performing its duties and responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external consultant and an in-house remuneration expert.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee met three times in 2021 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The CEO, the Chief HR Officer, the Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary and the Head of Rewards generally attend the Committee's meetings. The committee also consulted with the CEO, the Board of\n\nManagement and certain other key management employees. Following those consultations, the Committee prepared decisions and advised the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs part of the standing agenda, the Remuneration Committee discussed, among other matters, the interim and final performance results on variable remuneration components for the previous periods, target setting for variable remuneration for the upcoming periods, benchmark studies results and base salary levels for the Board of Management, as well as disclosure in the remuneration report.\n\nNo changes were proposed to the remuneration policy for the Board of Management nor for the Supervisory Board in 2021. The Committee reflected on the AGM advisory vote on the 2020 remuneration report, also in comparison with the vote on the prior year's report and changes in the remuneration report made since. The Committee Chair engaged with key stakeholders, such as shareholders, shareholder representative groups and the Dutch Central Works Council, to obtain feedback on executive remuneration in general and attention points for the 2021 remuneration report, and reported the findings back to the Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nPlease also refer to chapter 9, Remuneration Report, of this Annual Report, for further information on the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and how these were implemented in 2021.\n\n## 8.3.4 D igital Committee\n\nIn view of the importance of digitalization, the Supervisory Board established the Digital Committee as of January 1, 2021.\n\nThe Digital Committee assists the Supervisory Board by, amongst other matters, reviewing the company's digital strategy and roadmap, digital objectives and performance and the governance for deciding on digital prioritization.\n\nFrank Lubnau (Chair), Eelco Blok and Rita Lane are the members of this Committee.\n\nThe Digital Committee met four times in 2021 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The Committee also had additional working sessions and deep dives on particular transformation topics and projects. The CFO, the Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO) and the Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary generally attend the Committee meetings. The Committee Chair has regular contact with the CFO and the CDIO.\n\nIn early 2021, the company's management further strengthened its digital foundation and governance, and established a digital steering committee with participation from key business and technology stakeholders. The company also appointed a Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO) to its leadership team, to drive the company's digital aspiration to lead the lighting industry by building and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage through a superior digital experience and data insights.\n\nThe Digital Committee was closely engaged in the company's strategy to further strengthen its digitalization initiatives. In the first meetings, the Committee had in depth discussions on the key components of the company's digital aspiration. It reviewed and advised on the company's digital strategy, roadmap and priorities, to support the company's overall strategy. Once the foundation of the Committee's activities was laid, the Committee discussed with management the highlights and priorities on a quarterly basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8.4 Performance\n\n## evaluation\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2021.\n\nThe Board of Management also performed a self-evaluation of its functioning and the functioning of its individual members. The members of the Board of Management shared their views on their team and personal targets performance in a dialogue with the Chair and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, which were discussed in the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe objective of our Supervisory Board selfevaluation is to gain better insight into the functioning of the Supervisory Board, to identify strengths that we want to keep and to identify matters that the Supervisory Board or the company can improve. Building on feedback provided in 2020, together with relevant developments in 2021, we prepared\n\n<!-- image -->",

The questionnaire addressed, among other matters, the focus of discussions during our meetings, the depth and quality of discussions on key topics, the functioning of the committees, the relationship between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, the views on the Supervisory Board as a team and how it conducted itself, learnings from 2021, as well as the desired focus in the future.\n\nThe questionnaire was completed by members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management as well as the Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary to the boards. Following an evaluation of the questionnaire by the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, observations were discussed in a plenary session with the Supervisory Board only. Hereafter, one-on-one discussions took place between the Chair and the individual Supervisory Board members, and with the Vice Chair on the functioning of the Chair. The responses to the questionnaire were shared with all respondents together with a proposal for follow-ups.\n\nThe self-evaluation has once again provided valuable insights on how the Supervisory Board operates as a team and where the Supervisory Board and the company can improve. In 2021, the Supervisory Board experienced that it operated as a critical and constructive team. The Supervisory Board meetings were found to be well prepared, and the discussions open and to the point. The evaluation brought practical insights, for example how valuable the Supervisory Board members find it to meet in person and to meet with senior management around the board meetings, which will thus be continued when the COVID-19 situation permits. In addition, the evaluation identified topics for further discussions, such as on the company's operating environment and competition.\n\n## 8.5 Financial statements 2021 and dividend\n\nSignify's Consolidated and Company financial statements for 2021, as prepared by the Board of Management, have been audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as independent external auditor appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Its report has been included in the Combined independent auditor's report. We have approved these financial statements.\n\nWe recommend to the General Meeting of Shareholders to adopt the financial statements for 2021. We likewise recommend to shareholders that they adopt the proposal by the Board of Management to declare a cash dividend of EUR 1.45 per ordinary share from the 2021 net income.\n\n## 8.6 Appreciation\n\nThe year 2021 proved to be another year full of challenges caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply disruptions. We would like to thank the Board of Management and all Signify employees for their continued commitment and great work throughout the year, which resulted in  a solid performance.\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nArthur van der Poel Gerard van de Aast Eelco Blok Pamela Knapp Rita Lane Frank Lubnau",

This report includes a detailed explanation of the current remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The effectuation of these policies in 2021 is discussed in parts 9.2 and 9.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nThis was another challenging year with the continued impact of COVID-19 and the overall supply chain and component availability issues. We are very proud of how the company performed in 2021, and the resilience that was exhibited. The company responded quickly as conditions changed in the supply chain and COVID-19 resulted in ongoing uncertainty around the world, while employees continued to focus well to deliver for our stakeholders. Over the course of 2021 we continued our engagement with key stakeholders, such as shareholders, shareholder representative groups and the Dutch Central Works Council, to understand their views on remuneration in general and to solicit feedback on the remuneration report of Signify. These interactions were very productive, leading to a good dialogue and valuable feedback, particularly on the strong link that exists between Signify's ESG metrics and remuneration for the Board of Management via the company's long-term incentive plan.\n\n## Signify's performance in 2021\n\nSignify had a solid performance in 2021 given the volatility of the year. Our industry continued to be challenged with supply chain issues and with uncertain and inconsistent recovery in many markets. However, Signify was able to capitalize well on demand and provide customers with solutions to solve their particular business needs. In addition, the company was able to minimize supply chain disruptions to our customers. As a result, the company experienced an increase in comparable sales growth. Moreover, profitability as a percentage of sales improved and free cash flow performance was again very solid. Relative to the targets set at the beginning of 2021, the results on the key financial measures and the achievement against individual targets resulted in an above target outcome on the annual incentive for the Board of Management.\n\nSignify continues to lead the way in sustainability with the Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program. Signify continues to strongly perform on the ambitious targets set in the sustainability programs, such as circular economy via circular revenues, and climate action via the company's intent to double the pace of achieving the 1.5\u00b0C scenario of the Paris Agreement (1.5\u00b0C pathway over our value chain to reach the 2031 ambition in 2025, or 6 years early). This positive financial and non-financial performance in free cash flow, relative total shareholder return and sustainability is also reflected in the over achievement of the conditions for vesting of the 2019\n\n<!-- image -->",

Maintaining this ambitious drive beyond carbon neutrality, which was achieved in 2020, the company continues to lead the way both in sustainability overall as well as in the direct link with the remuneration of the Board of Management.\n\n## TSR peer group\n\nThere continues to be much change in our industry. During 2021, Cree sold its LED products business unit becoming a pure-play semiconductor company in the process. As a result, we have reviewed their inclusion in the TSR peer group and determined that it is best to replace Cree. The current TSR performance peer companies and potential replacement competitor companies were analyzed in terms of underlying parameters such as risk, size, value/growth, etc. to determine an appropriate replacement for Cree. As a result, per January 1, 2022, Cree was replaced by MLS Co Ltd., a direct competitor of Signify in LED lighting.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nSignify's 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders was held on May 18, 2021.\n\nThe changes we introduced to the remuneration report have been welcomed and well received and the 2020 remuneration report was supported by shareholders.\n\nTo further understand stakeholder feedback on the Signify Remuneration Report 2020, as well as views on executive remuneration in general, we engaged with stakeholders, such as shareholders, shareholder representative groups and the Dutch Central Works Council, prior to the creation of the Remuneration Report for 2021.\n\nWe experienced those conversations as very constructive and they have led to improvements in our Remuneration Report. Two key points came from those interactions:\n\ni) the degree of discretion that the Remuneration Committee may take in determining remuneration over 2021, and;\n\nii) the link between ESG metrics and remuneration overall.\n\nWith respect to the first item, the outcomes on both the annual incentive plan and the longterm incentive plan reflect the actual performance despite the continued challenges presented over 2021. No discretion was applied on those outcomes, nor were targets adjusted during 2021. The link between ESG metrics and remuneration overall was a key component of all stakeholder conversations. Signify was identified as being a leader in their approach to sustainability, the degree of reporting on these metrics and the related link to the long-term incentive plan. We are pleased with this feedback and continue to evolve the 2021 report in direct response to this feedback. We trust that stakeholders will experience these changes positively and appreciate the spirit of transparency and continuous improvement which drives them.\n\n## Gerard van de Aast\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 9.2 Remuneration Board of Management\n\n## Introduction\n\nSignify has a balanced compensation policy for its employees, from our CEO and other members of the Board of Management to all employees worldwide. Our policy aims to stimulate sustainable short- and long-term value creation. Therefore, the performance measures used in the variable compensation components are linked to quantitative financial, non-financial and sustainability targets. The remuneration policy also serves a communication purpose as it clearly stipulates and supports a common approach to deliver on the company's strategy.\n\n## Signify's value creation model :\n\nThe value created by Signify goes beyond financial performance alone. Our approach is to optimize long-term value through financial, environmental and social resources. Our focus on environment and societal implications of doing business is evidenced in our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program. This program links to our long-term incentive plan and ensures that the interests of the organization, society at large and our impact on the environment in which we live are key elements in how Signify delivers long-term value creation to stakeholders. Our activities and our way of doing business impact customers, employees, investors and society at large. Signify expresses these impacts in monetary terms in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, section 3.3, of this Annual Report.\n\nThe current remuneration policy for the Board of Management a nd for the Supervisory Board was adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) in 2020. The effectuation of these policies in 2021 is discussed in parts 9.2 and 9.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nThe report included in this chapter constitutes the remuneration report within the meaning of Section 2:135b of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe following principles apply for the remuneration policy of the Board of Management:\n\n- \u00b7 Signify's remuneration policy aims to attract, reward and retain qualified leaders to pursue the company's purpose and long-term strategic objectives, whilst taking the interest of all company's stakeholders into account.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration levels are to be competitive and in line with the market practice of comparable companies and support a pay-for-performance philosophy with a proportion of remuneration at risk.\n- \u00b7 During the policy design and review process, stakeholder feedback and legal provisions, including the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, are taken into consideration.\n\n## Remuneration components\n\nThe compensation package for the members of the Board of Management consists of the following fixed and variable components:\n\n- \u00b7 base salary\n- \u00b7 annual cash incentive\n- \u00b7 long-term equity-based incentive\n- \u00b7 pensions and other benefits\n\nThe combination of a member's base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity-based incentive, together referred to as the 'total direct compensation', is targeted around the median level of a representative labor market peer group and benchmarked on a regular basis.\n\nThis peer group consists of 50% Dutch headquartered cross-industry companies that are included in the AEX or AMX, and 50% European sector specific companies.\n\nAs of January 2020, the labor market peer group consists of the following 14 companies:\n\n## Labor Market Peer Group\n\n| Aalberts   | DSM     | Prysmian Group    |\n|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| AkzoNobel  | KPN     | Rexel             |\n| ASML       | Legrand | Rheinmetall Group |\n| BAM        | Nexans  | Siemens Gamesa    |\n| Boskalis   | OSRAM   |                   |\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the peer group on a regular basis and may adjust to ensure that the companies in the group remain relevant peers. Signify joined the AEX on March 22, 2021. This has not led to a change in the labor market peer group since Signify as a company has not changed significantly.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Comparatives for 2020 were revised as performance shares costs for C.L. van Schooten were EUR 242.363 higher than disclosed in 2020. The performance shares costs for M.L. Mariani also include the costs for shares awarded when she was not yet a member of the Board of Management.\n- 4 Costs of restricted shares rights are based on accounting standards (IFRS) and do not reflect the value of the shares at the vesting/release date and concerns the sign-on grant of EUR 300,000 for F.J. van Engelen Sousa.\n- 5 The stated amounts mainly concern (part of) allowances to members of the Board of Management that can be considered as remuneration. In a situation where such a part of an allowance can be considered as (indirect) remuneration (for example, private use of the company car or car allowance), then such  part is both valued and accounted for here. The method employed by the fiscal authorities in the Netherlands is the starting point for the value stated. Net allowances are not included.\n- 6 As the company elected not to renew the services contract of C.L. van Schooten after the end of term in May 2021, as per his services contract, he received a lump sum payment of one time the annual base compensation/salary (gross amount of EUR 589,057) in June 2021. An additional tax levy, pursuant to Article 32bb of the Dutch wage tax act, will be payable by the company over the total remuneration of C.L. van Schooten. The estimate was revised to EUR 2,405,224 (2020 estimate: EUR 543,883). The calculation of the tax levy due by the company includes the taxable value of the long-term equity-based incentive. That taxable value depends on the final number of shares that will be delivered to C.L. van Schooten in 2022 and 2023 (pending final achievement of performance conditions) and the company's share price upon delivery of the shares (these equity rights were granted in 2019 and 2020).\n- 7 Hired per June 15, 2020, and appointed member of the Board of Management on October 27, 2020 EGM.

Furthermore, estimated future remuneration levels are assessed against the potential achievement of\n\nstrategic objectives. Based on the scenario analyses performed, the Supervisory Board has concluded that the policy supports the pay-for-performance philosophy.\n\n## 9.2.2 B ase salary\n\nThe base salary compensates for the individual's experience, skills, duties, responsibilities and the contribution of the individual within Signify. The Supervisory Board determines the base salary and may adjust the base salary, for example following the results of benchmark studies and to ensure alignment between members of the Board of Management. Absent any adjustment of the base salary, it follows the (collective and merit) increase as agreed for the CLA population in the Netherlands. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the total direct compensation (including base salaries).\n\nThe annual compensation of the members of the Board of Management was reviewed in 2021 in line with the regular remuneration review. The Remuneration Committee considered the input of the Board of Management members in setting their pay levels.\n\nFor 2021, the Supervisory Board decided to align the annual base salaries of F.J. van Engelen Sousa and M.L. Mariani in view of her extended scope of responsibilities as a board member. As a result, M.L. Mariani's base salary has been adjusted to EUR 590,000 as per January 1, 2021. The Supervisory Board also decided to increase the base salary levels for all members of the Board of Management by 2%, in line with the budgets (collective and merit increase) allocated for the CLA population in the Netherlands.\n\n## New base salaries Board of Management in 2021 in EUR\n\n|                        | January 1, 2021 (+ 2%)   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| E.H.E.

Variable pay is based on both financial and non-financial performance measures. In selecting performance measures, their respective weights and targets for a performance period, the following is considered:\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Performance measures are selected based on relevance to the company's strategy.\n- \u00b7 The company's strategy determines the targets and intervals for the performance measures.\n- \u00b7 Targets are set ambitiously yet realistically, taking the company's risk appetite into account.\n- \u00b7 Alignment with stakeholders' interests and expectations is essential.\n\nThe Supervisory Board determines the target for each of the performance measures of the annual cash incentive and the long-term equity-based incentive. The target definition for these variable remuneration components includes target intervals and correlating pay-out schemes, being defined in incremental steps in performance and respective pay-out. In addition, a minimum threshold for the achievement of financial performance measures applies, below which there will be no pay-out. Following the end of the relevant performance period, the Supervisory Board will assess the actual performance relative to the targets set. On that basis, the Supervisory Board will, at its discretion, determine the achievement per performance measure and target.\n\n## 9.2.4 A nnual cash incentive\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are eligible for an annual cash incentive. The annual incentive is designed to reward the achievement of annual financial and operational objectives and personal performance. The purpose is to ensure alignment with the company's annual business plan setting the strategic priorities for that year, which in turn contribute to the company's long-term objectives.\n\nThe Supervisory Board can annually select two or three financial performance measures from the following list, and determine the weighting per performance measure: growth (such as comparable sales growth), profit (such as adjusted EBITA or net income), cash flow (such as average working capital or free cash flow) and investment return (such as return on capital employed).\n\nThe possibility to annually select financial performance measures from the above list gives the Supervisory Board a certain level of flexibility to ensure continuous alignment of the performance measures with the company's strategy and financial objectives for the mid-term.\n\nThe financial performance measures used in the annual incentive to track performance over 2021 were comparable sales growth (measured as a percentage of sales), Adjusted EBITA (measured as a percentage of sales) and free cash flow (measured as a percentage of sales). These measures were determined by the Supervisory Board to reflect the best alignment with the company's strategy and financial objectives for the mid-term focusing on profitable growth. The financial targets for 2021 were set within the context of the medium-term objectives of the company at the beginning of the year and did not change over the course of 2021. Pay-out between the financial targets is linear.\n\nThe team/individual performance measures are recommended by the CEO and discussed and ultimately approved by the Supervisory Board. For 2021, these measures included Brighter Lives, Better World 2021 targets, employee and customer Net Promoter Scores, operational efficiency, sales growth for new growth engines, digital roadmap impact and implementation of the reorganization of the central functions.\n\n## Performance achievements 2021\n\nPerformance against financial targets are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The assessment of performance under the annual incentive plan is concluded by the Supervisory Board.\n\nFor 2021, the company performed well given the considerable external challenges it faced during the year. Although the company returned to growth, comparable sales growth was below the target level of performance resulting in an achievement of 80%. Adjusted EBITA was above the target level of performance that was set at the beginning of 2021, reflecting improved profitability, and as such results in an achievement of 160%. The company also performed well on free cash flow with a result above target level of performance resulting in an achievement of 107.1%. The Supervisory Board did not apply any discretion to the outcomes of the financial measures, nor were any changes made to the original targets set for the year 2021.\n\nFinally, the Supervisory Board assessed the achievement of the Board of Management relative to each of their individual goals and their collective team goals. The Supervisory Board was very pleased with the overall implementation during 2021 of the program to create a leaner central organization. In doing so, the Board of Management achieved cost-saving measures while increasing focus on innovation and sustainability. Progress towards the Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program remains very strong, with 3 out of 4 of the metrics on track or above the expected trajectory to double Signify's impact. Carbon footprint reduction, circular revenues, and Brighter Lives revenues were on track or above the expected trajectory to achieve the ambitions of the 2025 program.Women in leadership positions was off track relative to the ambition for the year, although the Supervisory Board was pleased that it has continued to improve in 2021, reflecting an 8% increase since 2019. Lastly, there has been very good progress on the delivery of the digital roadmap specifically related to customer interfaces and experience, as well as process automation.\n\nFrom a customer perspective, the Supervisory Board was very pleased with the continued progress in the customer Net Promoter Score from 41 in 2020 to 44 in 2021, notwithstanding the ongoing supply chain and COVID-19 related challenges. Despite this improvement, it remained slightly below our ambition of a customer Net Promoter Score of 45. From a great place to work perspective, despite a dip early in the year due to the impact of creating a leaner central organization, the employee Net Promoter Score recovered very well to end 2021 at an all-time high of 32 and above the goal of 30 versus 29 at the end of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Connected lighting sales grew by 21% and growth platforms grew by 19%. Despite this positive trajectory, performance across the growth platforms was overall behind expectations. Due to significant supply chain disruptions in 2021, which included global component shortages and logistics challenges, the company was impacted on its ability to meet the high demand. As a result, operational efficiencies in the form of savings and service levels were also behind expectations.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed the team and individual objectives and achievements as described above and assessed performance for 2021 as strong.

The objective of the long-term incentive is to link pay with long-term sustainable value creation. In addition to the Board of Management, another approximately 700 employees globally are eligible for participation in a similar long-term incentive plan.\n\nThe main characteristics of the long-term incentive plan for the Board of Management are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The long-term incentive is granted in performance shares only and granted annually.\n- \u00b7 The vesting of performance shares is conditional upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of three financial years and continued Signify employment.\n- \u00b7 Performance is measured using four performance measures in 2021: relative total shareholder return (25%), free cash flow (25%), return on capital employed (25%) and sustainability (25%).\n- \u00b7 Pay-out per performance measure can vary between 0% and 200%.\n\n## Performance measures 2020 and 2021 grant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRelative TSR\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nSustainability\n\nROCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance measures 2019 grant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRelative TSR\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nSustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Relative TSR\n\nThe vesting of 25% (40% for 2019 grant) of the shares granted is subject to a TSR condition. Relative total shareholder return (TSR) measures the share price growth plus dividends paid over the three-year performance period. Performance is expressed as a percentage. This percentage is compared to the TSR performance of companies included in the peer group specifically compiled for this purpose. The TSR performance is determined for each company in the peer group and the performances are ranked from top to bottom. Signify's position in the ranking, together with the pay-out curve, determines the pay-out level,\n\nIn 2021, the peer group consisted of the following companies:\n\n## TSR Peer Group\n\n| ABB               | Johnson Controls   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Acuity Brands     | Legrand            |\n| Cree              | Panasonic          |\n| Eaton Corporation | Signify            |\n| Fagerhult         | Schneider Electric |\n| Hitachi           | Toshiba            |\n| Honeywell Int.    | Zumtobel Group     |\n| Hubbel            |                    |\n\nThe peer group is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the companies in the group remain relevant peers. In case a peer needs to be replaced due to a corporate event (merger, acquisition, and so on) the Supervisory Board will ensure that the adjusted peer group remains aligned with the strategic objectives, the geographical spread and the business characteristics of Signify. As explained in the letter of the Remuneration Committee Chair under 9.1, per January 1, 2022 Cree was replaced by MLS Co Ltd. This means that:\n\n- \u00b7 For the LTI 2020 grant (vesting in 2023) and the LTI 2021 grant (vesting in 2024), TSR will be calculated on a 'synthetic combination', i.e. Cree until January 1, 2022 and MLS as of January 1, 2022.\n- \u00b7 As of the LTI 2022 grant (vesting in 2025 and thereafter), MLS will replace Cree in the TSR peer group.\n\n## Performance-incentive zone for TSR in % of grant value (2020 and 2021 grant)\n\n| Ranking   |   15 |   14 |   13 |   12 |   11 |   10 |   9 |   8 |   7 |   5 | 4   | 3   | 2 1             |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|\n| Payout    |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |   0 |  75 | 100 | 150 |     |     | 175 200 200 200 |\n\n## Performance-incentive zone for TSR in % of grant value (2019 grant)\n\n| Ranking   |   15 |   14 |   13 |   12 |   11 |   10 | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5 4   | 3   | 2 1                                |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|-----|------------------------------------|\n| Payout    |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |   60 |     |     |     |     |       |     | 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 200 200 |\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nThe vesting of another 25% (40% for 2019 grant) of the annual long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a free cash flow target over the three-year performance period. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe vesting of 25% (20% for 2019 grant) of the annual long-term incentive grant is dependent on how well Signify performs against the targets set with respect to the sustainability condition. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan. As targets set are usually  both qualitative and quantitative, set ambitiously and adjusted regularly, the assessment of the performance is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board. The assessment will use tracked performance as input.\n\n## Return on capital employed\n\nThe vesting of the remaining 25% (not applicable for 2019 grant) of the annual long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a return on capital employed target over the three-year performance period. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\nIn 2021, performance shares were granted to the members of the Board of Management. These grants are governed by the Signify long-term incentive plan. The grant is made on the basis of the average closing share price of the three months preceding the date of grant. In this way, the Signify granting policy ensures mitigation of share price volatility.",

In light thereof, the Supervisory Board determined the LTI Plan free cash flow achievement as 200%.\n\n## Sustainability (20% weighting)\n\nThe sustainability objectives for 2021 were based on the intent to double Signify's impact in the areas of climate action, the circular economy, brighter lives revenues and women in leadership\n\npositions by 2025. In all areas, significant progress has been made relative to the trajectory to deliver on the ambitions by 2025. Signify is on track to deliver against the ambitious goal of doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5 \u1d52 C scenario. Women in leadership positions has increased by 8% from 2019, but falls slightly slightly behind the trajectory to double the percentage of women in leadership positions by 2025. Circular and brighter lives revenues have exceeded the ambition set for 2021 with an increase in contributions from circular products, systems or services and an increase in revenues coming from lighting innovations that increase food availability, safety and security, or health and well-being. Based on the following LTI Plan sustainability measures and results over the performance period, the Supervisory Board determined the LTI Plan sustainability achievement as 183%.\n\n|                                                                     |                                | Status  1   | Result 2021  2                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| r W o r l d Climate action                                          | Carbon footprint reduction     | On Track    | Steady decrease of  emissions (scope 1, 2  and 3) |\n| B e Circular economy                                                | Circular revenues              | On Track    | 21% - 25%                                         |\n| r L i v e s Food availability Safety & security Health & well-being | Brighter lives revenues        | On Track    | 25% - 27%                                         |\n| B r i g Great place to work                                         | Women in leadership  positions | Off Track   | 25%                                               |\n\n- 1 Status versus Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 doubling target\n\nIn view of the above, the following performance achievement and vesting levels have been determined by the Supervisory Board in respect of the 2019 grant of performance shares.

These guidelines are designed to further align the interest of the members of the Board of Management (and certain other leaders within Signify) with the interests of its shareholders. For the CEO, the value in Signify shares to be held is 300% of base salary and for the other members of the Board of Management it is 200% of base salary. The guidelines require that all after-tax shares be retained until the required level is met.\n\nIn addition, members of the Board of Management shall comply with holding requirements under the Dutch corporate governance code. This effectively means that members of the Board of Management shall hold all after-tax shares received under the long-term incentive plan for a period of at least five years from the date of grant.\n\n## Signify Shares held by Board members in number of shares\n\n|                        | December 31, 2020   | Holdings as % of base  1   | December 31, 2021   | Holdings as % of base  1   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| E.H.E.

The net pension arrangement is in line with all other Signify employees in the Netherlands whose pensionable salary exceeds the cap. Participation in this net pension arrangement is voluntary.\n- \u00b7 A temporary gross transition allowance, for a maximum period of eight years (first five years in full; year 6: 75%; year 7: 50%, year 8: 25%). The temporary gross transition allowance only applies to members of the Board of Management who were employed before January 1, 2015, and participated in the former executive pension plan, before the change to the flex pension plan per January 1, 2015, with the capping of pension accruals and increase of pensionable age in line with the retirement age for state pension (AOW). The level of the allowance is based on the age and salary of the Board Member on December 31, 2014. As such this only applies to E.H.E. Rondolat.\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the accumulated annual pension entitlements and the pension costs of the individual members of the Board of Management.\n\n## Accumulated annual pension entitlements and pension-related costs in EUR\n\n|                  | Age at  December 31, 2021 Accumulated  annual   pension as of  December 31,  2020  1   | Total pension- related costs 2020  2   | Accumulated  annual   pension as of  December 31,  2021 1   | Total pension- related costs 2021  2   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| E.H.E.

Free cash flow has improved over the five year period from 2017 to 2021, while the Signify share price has steadily increased. The total remuneration of the Board of Management has developed in line with the company performance. Total remuneration for the CEO has remained steady since 2020. As the other members of the Board of Management were new to\n\nthe Board in 2020, their remuneration comparison reflects a partial year in 2020. Annual incentive increased from 2020 driven by achievements on incentive plan metrics as detailed in sub-section 9.2.4. The performance on the long-term incentive conditions is very positive as detailed in sub-section 9.2.7, which influences ongoing grants. The development of the Signify share price has increased 18% since 2020. While free cash flow remained very solid in 2021, it declined compared to 2020. The total remuneration of the CEO reflects a decline in the pension transition allowance as detailed in sub-section 9.2.9 and an increase in annual incentive outcomes as detailed in sub-section 9.2.4.\n\nEmployee pay remains generally steady from 2020. Since 2018, a greater proportion of our employee population has shifted from Western Europe to South East Asia, Asia, and Latin America. In 2021, the proportion of our employee population in the regions was steady with a slight decrease in China and a slight increase in Latin America. The impact on average employee pay was a 1% decrease versus 2020.\n\n## 9.2.10 Signify's internal pay ratio\n\nThe remuneration design for the members of the Board of Management is an integral part of the overall pay structure within the company. Signify uses the Hay system to evaluate and grade the various positions within its organization. This means that the company uses a standardized method for determining the appropriate benefits for each of the respective job levels within the company. Using the Hay grading system also ensures that the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is aligned with and is relative to the remuneration of Signify employees holding other positions within the company. The remuneration of senior staff within Signify is based on the same components as the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Code requires reporting on the pay ratio. Signify's pay ratio reflects the average total compensation of the total global employee workforce, relative to the total remuneration package of the CEO. This has resulted in the following outcome:\n\n|   Fiscal year | CEO total  remuneration  1   | Average total  compensation employees  2   |   Resulting pay  ratio |\n|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|          2021 | 3,230,032                    | 51,337                                     |                     63 |\n|          2020 | 3,245,335                    | 51,780                                     |                     63 |\n|          2019 | 2,822,104                    | 60,601                                     |                     47 |\n|          2018 | 2,564,306                    | 61,264                                     |                     42 |\n|          2017 | 3,048,621                    | 64,550                                     |                     47 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The acquisitions of Cooper Lighting and Klite resulted in an increase in the employee population from 2019 to 2020 and the majority of that increase was in Latin America, India and China. In addition, Signify has been increasing the employee population in India due to growth in R&D software and IT. As a result, average employee pay has been trending down reflective of this significant shift in employee geographic spread. This impacted significantly the pay ratio from 2019 to 2020.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio has remained steady from 2020 to 2021. This is aligned to the employee pay trend from 2020 to 2021 and results in a consistent pay ratio in 2021. Signify believes that the pay ratio over the past years aligns with Signify's profile, considering the company's industry, workforce profile and changing geographic spread.\n\n## 9.2.11 Claw back and change of control\n\nThe annual cash incentive and the long-term incentive of the members of the Board of Management are subject to adjustment and claw back provisions. Pursuant hereto, the company can (a) revise an incentive prior to payment if unaltered payment would be unreasonable and unfair, (b) recover an incentive if it was granted on the basis of incorrect information on the fulfillment of the incentive goals or the conditions for payment of the incentive, and (c) recoup incentives in the circumstances set forth in the services contract with the member of the Board of Management concerned.\n\nIn the event of a change of control of the company, the Supervisory Board can, at its sole discretion, decide to accelerate the vesting of any unvested awards under the long-term incentive, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions up to the date of the completion of the change of control.\n\nNo variable remuneration was clawed-back In 2021.\n\n## 9.2.12 Additional arrangements\n\nUnless relevant law provides otherwise, the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board shall be reimbursed by the company for various costs and expenses, such as\n\nreasonable costs of defending claims, as formalized in the Articles of Association. Under certain circumstances, described in the Articles of Association, such as an action or failure to act by a member of the Board of Management or a member of the Supervisory Board that can be characterized as intentional ('opzettelijk'), intentionally reckless ('bewust roekeloos') or seriously culpable ('ernstig verwijtbaar'), there will be no entitlement to this reimbursement. The company has also provided liability insurance (D&O - Directors & Officers) for the persons concerned.\n\n## 9.2.13 Contractual arrangements\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are engaged by a service contract ('overeenkomst van opdracht') with a maximum of four years ending on the date of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in the fourth calendar year after the appointment. Members of the Board of Management are appointed for a maximum period of four years, subject to re-appointment by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Termination of the services contract is subject to a notice period of six months for either party. The terms and conditions of these service agreements have been aligned with the relevant Dutch Corporate Governance Code provisions.\n\n## 9.2.14 Severance arrangements\n\nContractual severance arrangements of members of the Board of Management comply with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and provide for compensation for the loss of income resulting from a termination of employment and are capped at one time the annual base salary.\n\nNo severance is payable in case the agreement is terminated early at the initiative of the Board of Management member.\n\nThe Board of Management member shall not be entitled to a severance payment if the contract is terminated for urgent cause ('dringende reden'). For the definition of urgent cause ('dringende reden'), reference is made to section 7:678 of the Dutch Civil Code and further.\n\n## 9.2.15 L oans\n\nThe company does not grant loans to members of the Board of Management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The two boards are independent of each other and are accountable to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) for the performance of their duties.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for maintaining an appropriate corporate governance structure of the company.\n\nSignify N.V.'s corporate governance framework is based on the company's Articles of Association, the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act and any other applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, the Board of Management has implemented a code of conduct, policies, directives and authorization schedules throughout Signify in order to strengthen its governance framework.\n\nIn this chapter, the company addresses the main elements of its corporate governance structure, reports on how it applies the principles and best practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and provides the information required by the Dutch governmental decrees on Corporate Governance and Article 10 Takeover Directive. Deviations from aspects of the corporate governance structure of the company, when deemed necessary in the interests of the company, will be disclosed in this chapter of the Annual Report.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, other parts of the Annual Report address and explain the strategy and culture of Signify aimed at long-term value creation. Signify's strategy is described in more detail in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, of this Annual Report. Here, we also explain our value creation model which allows our stakeholders to consider the economic, social and environmental impact of our business activities. The CEO message in chapter 2 highlights how the company's strategy was executed in 2021; in this regard, please refer to chapter 4, Corporate performance and chapter 8, Supervisory Board report, of this Annual Report, which describe how the Supervisory Board is involved in the company's strategy as well as other topics such as culture and diversity & inclusion. As set out in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, section 16.3, of this Annual Report, Signify's culture is centered around its four values: Customer First, Game Changer, Greater Together and Passion for Results, and anchored by the integrity norms described in our Integrity Code. An important aspect of our culture relates to diversity & inclusion which is discussed and explained in the same chapter.\n\n## 10.1 Signify organization\n\nSignify's business is organized and managed on a functional basis by technology and endmarkets through three divisions: Division Digital Solutions, Division Digital Products and Division Conventional Products.

These market clusters are principally responsible for driving and managing sales, managing customer relationships and delivering the commercial activities of the business across the company's markets, covering commercial activities in almost all countries. The company operates in many countries via its subsidiaries and affiliated companies as well as via a limited number of branch offices, which primarily act under the Signify trade name.\n\nDivisions and market clusters are supported by centralized shared services with respect to, among other functions, legal, finance, human resources, business transformation, strategy, marketing, innovation and operations.\n\n## 10.2 Board of Management\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. The Board of Management focuses on long-term value creation for the company and its business, and takes the relevant stakeholders' interests into account.\n\nAmong other responsibilities, the Board of Management drives the company's management agenda, defines and deploys the\n\nstrategic direction, identifies opportunities and risks connected with its business activities and strategy, pursues the operational and financial objectives of the company and monitors corporate social responsibility issues relevant to the company.\n\nIn performing its duties, the Board of Management is guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprises, taking into consideration the interests of its stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of Management is accountable for its actions and decisions to the Supervisory Board and is answerable to shareholders of the company at the AGM.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Board of Management have regular contact with the Chair and other members of the Supervisory Board, attend most parts of the Supervisory Board meetings, and provide the Supervisory Board with all the information it needs to fulfil its own responsibilities.\n\nCertain decisions of the Board of Management require Supervisory Board approval, including important proposals for capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestments, decisions concerning financial and operational objectives and strategy to achieve such objectives, changes to corporate policies, as well as the annual operating plan.\n\nThe functioning and decision-making within the Board of Management are laid down in its Rules of Procedure which can be found on the company's website.\n\n## Appointment\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (the General Meeting) upon a nomination drawn up by the Supervisory Board, which nomination may be binding.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed for a maximum term of four years, it being understood that this term expires at the end of the AGM to be held in the fourth year after the year of their appointment. Reappointment is possible for consecutive terms of four years or, if applicable, until a later retirement date or other termination date in the fourth year, unless the General Meeting resolves otherwise. Members may be suspended by the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting, and dismissed by the latter.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management follows the board profile which aims for an appropriate combination of knowledge and experience among its members, encompassing industrial, technology & innovation, projects & infrastructure, digital & marketing, financial, economic, IT, social & sustainability aspects of international business and society, in relation to the global character of its business. This profile also applies for the Supervisory Board, and can be found on the company's website. The size of the Board of Management may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile.\n\n## Diversity\n\nSignify attaches great importance to diversity and it is its ambition to increase the diversity of the company's entire workforce to better mirror its stakeholders and markets. Signify believes that this will positively impact the company's business performance in all countries in which the company does business.\n\nIn view of the above, Signify aims for the Board of Management to be composed of members that bring a diversity of skills and expertise relevant for achieving the company's strategic and business objectives, different views and perspectives as well as different backgrounds (nationality, educational, working experience or otherwise), and that at least 30% are men and at least 30% are women. The Board of Management meets this gender diversity objective.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board based on the remuneration policy adopted by the General Meeting. The composition of the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the remuneration policy are described in chapter 9, Remuneration report, of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Conflicts of interest\n\nMembers of the Board of Management shall not participate in the discussions and decision-making process on a subject or transaction which they have a direct or indirect personal conflict of interest or have a conflict of interest within the meaning of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Relevant matters relating to conflicts of interests, if any, must be approved by the Supervisory Board and shall be mentioned in the Annual Report for the financial year in question. No conflict of interest as referred to above occurred during 2021.\n\n## Outside positions\n\nThe acceptance by a member of the Board of Management of a position as a member of a supervisory board or a position of nonexecutive director in a one-tier board at another company requires the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is required to be notified of other important positions (to be) held by a member of the Board of Management.\n\n## 10.3 Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board, in the two-tier board structure under Dutch law, is a separate body that is independent of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board supervises the policies and management and the general affairs of the company. The Supervisory Board also provides advice to the Board of Management. In performing its\n\nduties, the members of the Supervisory Board are guided by the interests of the company and the business of the group, taking into consideration the interests of its stakeholders.\n\n## Appointment\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting on the nomination of the Supervisory Board, which nomination may be binding. The Dutch large company regime ( structuurregime ) does not apply to Signify N.V. itself.\n\nThe Articles of Association do not provide for a fixed or maximum term of appointment. In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the members of the Supervisory Board have been appointed for a period of a maximum of four years, it being understood that the period of their appointment will end at the closing of the AGM to be held in the fourth year after appointment.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets at least six times a year. Meetings of the Supervisory Board are attended by the CEO and, if possible, by the other members of the Board of Management and the company's general secretary, unless the Supervisory Board decides otherwise and save for certain meetings as described in the Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board follows the same board profile that applies to the Board of Management, see 10.2 above.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board shall also be in accordance with the best practice provisions on independence of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code as well as Dutch law restrictions on the overall number of supervisory positions that a member of the Supervisory Board may hold. Each member shall be capable of assessing the broad outline of the overall management of the company.\n\nThe size of the Supervisory Board may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile. In 2021, the Supervisory Board consisted of  six members, all members being independent.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe company's diversity objectives that apply to the Board of Management, see 10.2 above, also apply to the Supervisory Board. In line with the company's gender diversity objectives, the Supervisory Board currently comprises of two-third men and one-third women. As such, the Supervisory Board also meets the target of Dutch legislation recently entered into force, introducing a \"grow in quota\", which should result in supervisory boards of listed companies being composed of at least 1/3 men and at least 1/3 women.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the individual members of the Supervisory Board, as well as the additional remuneration for its Chair and the members of its committees, is determined by the General Meeting. The composition of the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the remuneration\n\npolicy are described in chapter 9, Remuneration report, of this Annual Report.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe rules for conflict of interest applicable to the members of the Board of Management, see 10.2 above, also apply to the members of the Supervisory Board. No conflict of interest as referred to occurred during  2021.\n\n## Outside positions\n\nThe Supervisory Board member must inform the Chair of the Supervisory Board before accepting a position outside the company.\n\nDutch law provides for limitations on the overall number of supervisory positions (including a one-tier board) of large Dutch companies that a member of the Supervisory Board may hold. A person cannot be appointed as a managing or executive director of a large Dutch company if he or she already holds a supervisory position at more than two other large Dutch companies or if he or she is the chair of the supervisory board or one-tier board of another large Dutch company. Also, a person cannot be appointed as a supervisory director or nonexecutive director of a large Dutch company if he or she already holds a supervisory position at five or more other large Dutch companies, whereby the position of chair of the supervisory board or one-tier board of another large Dutch company is counted twice.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board is a separate corporate body that is independent of the Board of Management. Its independent character is also reflected in the requirement that members of the Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the Board of Management nor an employee of the company. Each member of the Supervisory Board meets the independence requirements as stated in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Supervisory Board Committees\n\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board had four committees: The Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee,  the Remuneration Committee and the Digital Committee.  Each of the committees has a preparatory and/or advisory role to the Supervisory Board. They report their findings to the full Supervisory Board, which is ultimately responsible for all decision-making. Information on the work and composition of the committees during 2021 is set out in chapter 8, Supervisory Board report, of this Annual Report.\n\nEach committee has a charter describing its role, responsibilities and functioning. These charters are published on the company's website.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for the integrity of the company's financial\n\nstatements, the financial reporting process, the system of internal business controls and risk management, the internal and external audit process, the internal and external auditor's qualifications, its independence and its performance, as well as the company's process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations and its Integrity code. It reviews the company's annual and interim financial statements, including non-financial information, prior to publication and advises the Supervisory Board on the adequacy and appropriateness of internal control policies and internal audit programs and their findings. It furthermore maintains contact with and supervises the external auditor and it prepares the nomination of an external auditor for appointment by the General Meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets at least once before the publication of the quarterly and annual accounts of the company.\n\n## Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee advises the Supervisory Board on its duties regarding the (procedures for the) selection and appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Board of Management. The duties of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee include preparing the selection criteria and appointment procedures for members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Board of Management and proposing the profile for the Supervisory Board. The Committee is also involved in the\n\nselection and appointment of the company's leadership team, appointments of which are subject to the Supervisory Board's approval. It also periodically assesses the size and composition of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and the functioning of the individual members. The performance evaluation of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board is led by this Committee. The Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee also proposes on appointments and re-appointments. It supervises the policy on selection criteria and appointment of senior executives within the company. At least once a year, it reviews the corporate governance of the company and can make recommendations to the Supervisory Board relating to the corporate governance of the company.\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee meets at least twice every year.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing proposals for the Supervisory Board on the remuneration policy for the Board of Management and on the remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management and for overseeing the long-term incentive plans for the company's executives involving the company's shares.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also reviews the proposed remuneration of certain senior executives designated by the Supervisory Board and the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and prepares proposals for adjustments, if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, the Remuneration Committee reviews and prepares proposals for the Supervisory Board concerning the corporate goals and objectives relevant to the annual incentive of members of the Board of Management, and reviews the performance of members of the Board of Management in light of those goals and objectives, and it prepares proposals for the Supervisory Board on the compensation levels of the members of the Board of Management, based on such review.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee prepares an annual remuneration report, which is included in chapter 9, Remuneration report, of this Annual Report. The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice per year.\n\n## Digital Committee\n\nThe Digital Committee is responsible for reviewing the company's digital strategy, roadmap, resourcing and any changes thereto. It also assists the Supervisory Board in supervising the company's policy on digital marketing strategies, tools and operations and reporting its findings and recommendations to the Supervisory Board. It reviews the company digital objectives and performance, periodically assesses the effectiveness and results of the digital initiatives as well as management skills, capabilities and training. At least once a year, the Digital Committee will review the governance for deciding on digital prioritization and spending within the company. On all topics, the Digital Committee will report its findings and recommendations to the Supervisory Board and prepare for any decision-making by the Supervisory Board in\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board of Management is entitled to determine the record date in accordance with Dutch law. The agenda, explanatory notes thereto and the procedure for attendance are published on the company's website. Holders of ordinary shares in the aggregate representing at least 3% of the total issued share capital may submit proposals for the AGM agenda. Such proposals must be made in writing at least 60 days before the AGM to the Board of Management. Any written request must comply with the procedure stipulated by the Board of Management, which is published on the company's website.\n\nEach ordinary share confers the right to cast one vote in the General Meeting. There are no special statutory rights attached to the shares of the company and no restrictions on the voting rights of the company's shares exist. Subject to certain exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast. A resolution to amend the Articles of Association requires a simple majority of the votes cast, if the resolution is adopted on a proposal of the Board of Management. Otherwise, such resolution requires a majority of at least three-fourths of the votes cast provided that majority represents\n\nmore than half of the issued share capital. Pursuant to Dutch law, no votes may be cast at a General Meeting in respect of shares which are held by the company.\n\n## Share capital and repurchase and issue of (rights to) shares\n\nThe authorized share capital of the company amounts to EUR 6 million, divided into 300 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of one eurocent each and 300 million preference shares, also with a nominal value of one eurocent each. On December 31, 2021, the issued share capital amounted to EUR 1.28 million, divided into 128,344,238 ordinary shares and no preference shares. All shares are fully paid-up. The shares are in registered form. There are currently no limitations either under Dutch law or the company's Articles of Association, as to the transfer of ordinary shares in the share capital of the company.\n\nThe Board of Management, to the extent authorized by the General Meeting for a specific period, may resolve to issue or repurchase shares, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management may limit or exclude preemptive rights if designated to do so by the General Meeting.\n\nAt the AGM held on May 18, 2021, the General Meeting resolved to authorize the Board of Management for a period of 18 months, effective as of May 18, 2021, to issue shares or grant rights to acquire ordinary as well as to restrict or exclude the preemptive rights accruing to shareholders, in each case up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital as at May 18, 2021, and subject to approval\n\nfrom the Supervisory Board. At the same time, the Board of Management was authorized to acquire shares in the company up to 10% of the issued share capital as at May 18, 2021, plus an additional 10% of the issued capital as of that same date in connection with the execution of share repurchase programs for capital reduction purposes.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions and change of control\n\nThe possibility of issuing preference shares in the share capital of the company is a defensive measure. To this end, the foundation Stichting Continu\u00efteit Signify has been granted a call option by the company to acquire preference shares. The foundation may resolve to exercise the call option at its sole discretion and does not require the consent of the company to exercise the call option. On the exercise of the call option, the foundation is entitled to acquire, and the company shall have the unconditional obligation to issue, preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company. This shall exclude the preference shares as issued and outstanding immediately prior to the exercise of the call option, less one preference share, from which maximum any preference shares already placed with the foundation at the time of the exercise of the call option must be deducted.\n\nThe call option can be exercised by the foundation in order to, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 prevent, slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited acquisition of shares by\n\n<!-- image -->",

No preference shares had been issued as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the foundation has the right to file a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to commence an inquiry procedure within the meaning of section 2:344 Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe foundation's objects are to further the interests of Signify N.V., the enterprises maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group. The foundation will act in such a way that the interests of the company and of those enterprises are optimally safeguarded and that influences which could affect the independence, continuity or identity of the company, the enterprise maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group in conflict with those interests are deterred to the best of the foundation's ability.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the board of the foundation was composed as follows: Jos Streppel (chair), Sietze Hepkema and Jan Willem Baud.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that also in the event of (an attempt at) a hostile takeover or other attempt to obtain (de facto) control of the company, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are authorized to exercise in the interests of Signify all powers vested in them.\n\nThe company is not a party to any material agreement that takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of control of the company following a take-over bid as referred to in section 5:70 of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act, other than the credit agreement entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions which established term loans and a revolving credit facility, certain bi-lateral credit agreements that have been entered into to refinance existing term loans, the Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020 and the Trade Mark License Agreement entered into with Koninklijke Philips N.V. The credit agreement includes a change of control provision which allows the lenders to cancel the commitment and declare any outstanding amounts under the agreement, immediately due and payable whereupon such amounts will become immediately due and payable. The provisions applicable to all Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020 contain a 'Change of Control Put Event'. This means that if the company experienced such an event with respect to such bonds, the company might be required to redeem or purchase the bonds at its principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\n\n## 10.5 External auditor\n\nUnder Dutch law, the external auditor of the company is appointed by the General Meeting. In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Regulation (EU) 537/2014, the Supervisory Board selects and nominates an external auditor for appointment, upon advice by the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee assess the functioning of the external auditor, taking the observations from the Board of Management into account. The General Meeting re-appointed Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as external auditor of the company for the financial years 2020 through 2022.\n\nThe external auditor attends, in principle, all meetings of the Audit Committee. The findings of the external auditor, the audit approach and the risk analysis are also discussed at these meetings. The external auditor attends the meeting of the Supervisory Board at which the report of the external auditor with respect to the audit of the annual accounts is discussed, and at which the annual accounts are approved.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nThe Audit Committee evaluates at least annually the external auditor's independence. The lead auditor in charge of the Signify account is changed every five years; such change took place as of the start of the financial year 2021. Furthermore, Dutch law requires the rotation of the external audit firm after the firm has completed the\n\nstatutory audit of the company for a period of 10 consecutive years.\n\n## Prohibition on non-audit services\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the proposed audit scope, approach and fees as well as services that the external auditor provides to the company. Dutch law requires the separation of audit and non-audit services, meaning the company's external auditor is not allowed to provide prohibited non-audit services.\n\n## 10.6 Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe company fully endorses the underlying principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, and is committed to adhering to the best practices of the Code as much as possible.\n\nThe company fully complies with the Code and applies all its principles and best practice provisions that are addressed to the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, if external circumstances allow, the company organizes an analyst dinner at least once a year hosted by the CEO and the CFO.

This now includes the cash outflow from the intended Fluence acquisition, and the 2022 cash inflow from its operations and the continued rationalization of the company's real estate portfolio.\n\nFinally, Signify will continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities in line with its strategic priorities.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nSignify plans to pay an increasing annual cash dividend per share year on year. The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and timing thereof depend on several factors, including future sales, profits, financial conditions, general economic and business conditions and prospects. Other factors that the Board of Management may deem relevant, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements, may also impact the amount, timing and payment of future dividends. These may be beyond the control of the company.\n\n## Proposed dividend\n\nThe company proposes a dividend of EUR 1.45 per share, in cash, from the net income for full-year 2021, in line with its dividend policy of paying an increasing cash dividend per share every year.\n\nThe dividend payment is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 17, 2022. Further details will be provided in the agenda for the AGM. Dividend in cash is, in principle, subject to 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax, which will be deducted from the dividend in cash paid to shareholders.\n\n## Dividend dates\n\n| Ex-dividend date      | 19 May 2022   |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Dividend record date  | 20 May 2022   |\n| Dividend payment date | 31 May 2022   |\n\n## Share repurchases for LTI hedging\n\nDuring 2021, Signify repurchased 1,700,000 shares in the open market for a total consideration of EUR 72 million to cover obligations arising from its long-term incentive performance share plan and other employee share plans. These repurchases took place in the period from February to May 2021.\n\nIn addition, 2021 includes a cash outflow of EUR 8 million for dividend withholding tax, related to the company's purchase of treasury shares for capital reduction purposes, and an outflow of EUR 12 million which is related to repurchases under the company's employee share plans.\n\n## 11.5 Debt info\n\nDuring 2021, Signify had a net reduction in its long-term loans of EUR 354 million.

By deploying a structured risk management process, it allows management to take risks in a controlled manner. The company's risk management and controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that strategic and financial business objectives are met. This is done by integrating management control into the daily operations, by ensuring compliance with legal requirements and by safeguarding the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures. The components of our risk management process are listed below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12.1 Establish strong risk management environment\n\nSignify's risk management environment is embedded in the corporate governance, the business control framework and the Integrity code.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nCorporate governance is the system by which a company is directed and controlled. Good corporate governance derives from, among other things, solid internal controls and high ethical standards.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for managing the risks associated with the company's activities and for defining the company's risk appetite. The Board of Management is assisted by the company's leadership team, which participate on a quarterly basis in audit risk and control meetings to identify critical risks and to review progress on the implementation of risk responses. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board provides oversight for the system of internal business controls and risk management. Internal audits, external audits or management self-assessment are reported to and discussed by the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. An in-depth description of the company's corporate governance structure can be found in chapter 10, Corporate governance, of this Annual Report.\n\n## Business Control Framework\n\nThe company's Business Control Framework (BCF) sets the standard for risk management and business controls in the company. The objectives of the BCF are to maintain (i) integrated management control of the company's operations in order to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and related disclosure, and (ii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The company has designed its BCF based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The company regularly evaluates and improves its BCF to align with business dynamics and good practices.\n\n## Integrity code\n\nActing with integrity is the cornerstone for the success of our business and for achieving our purpose. It is integral to the values that define us as a company. Acting with integrity means making the right choices when faced with ethical dilemmas, and holding ourselves and each other to high standards of behavior.\n\nThe Integrity code has been adopted by the Board of Management. It applies to all employees of Signify N.V. and its controlled subsidiaries. The Integrity code formulates minimum standards of behavior. The company has underlying policies that form an integral part of the Integrity code.\n\nTo increase the level of awareness and to create global engagement, the company has established a network of Compliance Officers in countries where the company has a presence, on each significant site, and at",

        "page_content": "Division, Market Group and Functional level. The activities and responsibilities of this network are focused on providing expertise and support on Integrity code-related matters to managers and employees.\n\nThe Integrity code is supported by mechanisms that ensure standardized reporting, escalation and investigation of concerns. These mechanisms are based on the Integrity code Reporting Policy that urges employees and third parties to report any concerns they may have regarding business conduct in relation to the Integrity code, either through a Compliance Officer or through the Signify Ethics line. The Signify Ethics line enables employees and third parties to report a concern either by telephone or online via a web intake form. All concerns raised are registered consistently in a single database and are investigated in accordance with standardized investigation procedures. An overview of the reporting activities for 2021 are given in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, of this Annual Report.\n\n## 12.2 Define Risk appetite\n\nRisk management in Signify focuses on the following risk categories: Strategic, Operational, Compliance and Financial risks. The board of management has determined the risk appetite and seeks to manage risk within these boundaries. The risk appetite is different for each of the risk categories:\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risks include economic and political developments and the effects of actions taken to anticipate and respond to market circumstances. The company has a medium strategic risk appetite and is prepared to take some reasonable strategic risks, balancing the need to capture return from opportunities and manage risks.\n\nThe company's key strategic risks are discussed in section 12.5 and include 'Technological change', 'Competition', 'Global political and economic instability - COVID-19', 'Digitalization', 'Acquisitions and integration' and 'Concentration risk'.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nOperational risks include adverse unexpected developments resulting from internal processes, people and systems, or from external events that are linked to the running of each business. The company has a low operational risk appetite and aims to minimize downside risks to maintain the high quality of its products, systems and services, reliable IT systems and sustainability commitments.\n\nThe company's key operational risks are discussed in section 12.5 and include 'Supply disruptions', 'Innovation', 'Cyber-attacks and security breaches', New organizational capabilities', and 'Climate change'.\n\n## Compliance risks\n\nThese risks cover unanticipated failures to implement, or comply with, appropriate laws, regulations, policies and procedures. The company is, due to its global footprint, exposed to risk of fraud and other misconduct in violation of the integrity code and/or applicable laws and regulations, governmental investigation and legal proceedings in relation thereto. The company has a very low compliance risk appetite and is committed to full compliance to relevant laws, regulations and its Integrity code.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company faces financial risks outside its control related to treasury, accounting and reporting, pensions, and tax. Here, the risk appetite is low. Therefore, the company aims to minimize the impact of financial risk, and it follows a conservative risk management approach in these areas. Furthermore, the company is committed to transparent and truthful accounting and reporting to allow users of the financial statements to take decisions considering these risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12.3\n\n## Risk assessment and control\n\nIn order to provide a comprehensive view of the company's business strategy and activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nThe company leadership team identifies the key risks, as part of the strategic review process. In a subsequent workshop the leadership team ranks the risks based on impact, likelihood, risk criticality and control effectiveness. As part of the strategic review cycle, initiatives are defined to mitigate the risks. Owners are assigned for each of the strategic initiatives, and they are then accountable for ensuring adequate risk mitigation and for  monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures. Each quarter the key risks are discussed during the audit and risk committee meeting. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated at Division, Market Group and company level.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nRisks are reported on a regular basis as part of the business performance reviews or, for specific topics, through dedicated risk committees. In addition, on an annual basis the top risks are identified by company leadership. Relevant risks, including those associated with business opportunities, are",

On a quarterly basis, risks and controls are reviewed with the Divisions, Market Groups and specific Functions in the audit risk committee.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nThe Integrity Committee is the ultimate body within Signify to administer the organization's Integrity Code Legal Compliance Program. It does so by maintaining oversight of the development and implementation of the Integrity code, including the monitoring of its effectiveness. The integrity Committee is chaired by the Chief Legal Officer. Its members include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief HR Officer, Head of Internal Audit and Head of Legal Compliance.\n\nWith an annual Integrity code selfassessment process forming part of ICS, compliance to the Integrity code forms part of management's ICS monitoring process. Management of each business unit signs off on controls relating to compliance with the Integrity code, with this confirmation forming part of the annual certification statement on Business Controls. Non-compliance issues are highlighted and, if significant, they are reported to the Board of Management through the Certification Statement process.\n\nEmployees are requested to state their commitment to the Integrity code after having completed the e-learnings. In 2021, employees were required to complete one or more e-learnings on the Integrity code and related legal compliance domains. Specific\n\ntarget groups were required to participate in recurring (virtual) classroom trainings. In addition, each year Finance and Procurement employees are asked to sign off on the Financial and the Procurement Codes of Ethics respectively. All executives are asked to sign off on the Integrity code annually to confirm their awareness of and compliance with the code. Violations of the Integrity code will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company has implemented a global standard for internal controls over financial reporting (ICS). ICS, together with the established accounting procedures, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect transactions necessary to permit preparation of financial statements, that policies and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and do not contain any material misstatements.\n\nInternal controls are an inherent part of the processes in our company, where the responsibility for executing these internal controls is with the persons that carry out these processes. The design and maintenance of the global standard for internal controls is with the (global) business process owners and the dedicated ICS team.\n\nAn ICS monitoring process exists for all material reporting units, whereby business process owners engaged in the key financial processes perform self-assessments on several key controls, document the results, and take corrective action where necessary.\n\nICS supports business and functional management in a periodic cycle of assessment and monitoring of the control environment.\n\nOn an annual basis, management's accountability for business controls is recorded through the formal issuance of a Certification Statement on Business Controls and a Letter of Representation by Divisions, reporting units and Functional management to the Board of Management. Any deficiencies noted in the design and operating effectiveness of controls over financial reporting, which were not completely remediated, are evaluated at year-end by the Board of Management. The Board of Management's statement, including its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, can be found in chapter 13, Statement of the Board of Management, of this Annual Report.\n\nThe global tax strategy and policy are aligned with our business and sustainability strategies and are published on the company's website. The Board of Management, enabling functions, Divisions and Markets are advised on tax matters by Group tax to ensure both the needs of the business and of tax are balanced. The company also participates in (inter)national groups of experts to represent its interests. In addition, the company has corporate requirements for the management of the company's legal entities in line with tax legislation.\n\nFor further details on financial risks please refer to note 9, Income tax, note 25, Postemployment benefits and note 29, Financial risk management, of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.4\n\n## Changes in 2021\n\nThe process to identify the key risks for the company was further improved in 2021. In previous years the risk workshop and the strategic review process were initiated separately, and the outcomes combined midway through the strategic review process. In 2021 the two processes were fully integrated from the start.\n\nIn 2021 the integration of Cooper Lighting in the internal control framework was completed.",

These risks can, separately or in combination, have a material adverse effect on Signify's business, strategy, financial condition, results from operations, cash flow, reputation, or prospects.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Technological change\n\n## Competition\n\nThe transition to LED lighting is characterized by the increasing importance of digital capabilities and technology, such as the adoption of connected lighting systems which may drastically change the business environment. At present, a relatively small part of the worldwide installed base of light points is connected.\n\nA cornerstone of Signify's strategy is to focus on and invest in its connected lighting offerings, such as its InterAct offerings for the professional market and Hue, WiZ smart lighting offerings for the consumer market.  Signify also aims to develop new business models, in particular through value-added service offerings.\n\nThe risk is that the extent and speed of adoption of connected lighting systems and services does not develop as anticipated, or that Signify is unable to successfully implement its strategy in connected lighting.\n\nThe LED lighting market has attracted many new competitors (particularly from Asia) with low-priced offerings and is at present highly competitive. This has led to increasing commoditization of offerings as well as price pressure on LED products. This may impact revenues and profitability, in particular, if Signify fails to manage costs.\n\nIn the area of connected lighting, the risk is that non-lighting players with broad technology platforms may enter and disrupt the lighting market.\n\nSignify is actively developing and investing in technology platforms and software applications to bring (more advanced) connected lighting systems to the market. Part of this strategy is to strongly focus on the interoperability of its applications and to incorporate different connectivity technologies in its connected lighting portfolio. thereby addressing different needs in the market.\n\nAdditionally, Signify plays a leading role in developing the market for connected lighting systems, in building awareness of the benefits of connected lighting, and in forging partnerships and alliances.\n\nFinally, in order to capture this new value opportunity, Signify's systems and product teams are developing innovative services around connected lighting.\n\nTo counter aggressive commoditization by Asian players, Signify's strategy is to create tiered offerings, including B-brand and private label. Further, the company continuously invests in innovation, strengthens its digital (sales) capabilities and runs cost-saving initiatives to keep its cost base competitive. Also, Signify can make use of the Philips brand which has a strong global reputation and brand preference to drive sales.\n\nIn general, Signify has a global sales and distribution network which would be difficult for a competitor to replicate. This network allows the company to quickly roll-out innovative products and services on a global scale.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such developments may impact Signify significantly as it has commercial activities and operations in almost every country.\n\nAdverse economic conditions may result in lower customer demand. In particular, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an adverse effect on the company's sales and results in 2021, both due to depressed professional demand and due to unprecedented supply chain disruptions, which impaired the company's ability to meet existing customer demand.\n\nLooking ahead, uncertainty and volatility remain regarding the continued impact of (mutations of) COVID-19, and therefore the recovery of the general lighting market to (pre-COVID) 2019 levels. This is relevant to Signify as a large part of its business is exposed to the construction and renovation activity, which has been impacted significantly by government lockdowns, and hence may take longer to recover.\n\nSignify increasingly depends on external suppliers and to a large extend, on the production of components and LED products from Asian countries. The risk of this higher dependency is that suppliers are not able to deliver (raw) materials, components or services on time for Signify to meet customer demand in a timely manner.\n\nNext to this, the production and shipping of products and components could be interrupted by conflicts, natural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods caused by climate change, or pandemic diseases.\n\nFinally, Increasing geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism, such as local manufacturing requirements, may disrupt the company's operations. This may limit the company's ability to leverage and draw efficiencies from its global (manufacturing) footprint.\n\nDue to COVID-19, in 2021 the company was, and continues to be, impacted by shortages of electronic components and logistics disruptions. Moreover, the company continues to see a volatile market with, in some cases, sharp increases in the costs of (raw) materials and key components, which may be difficult to fully pass on to customers.\n\nAt the macro level, Signify actively engages in global forums focused on the benefits of globalization. Signify is also committed to highly credible industry organizations globally to support the stabilization of global trade.\n\nIn order to minimize the impact of instability on its business, Signify closely follows and reviews (geo)political and economic developments and takes these into account in both its short- and medium-term operational planning.\n\nTo mitigate potential supply chain inefficiencies and tariff impacts arising from geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism, Signify leverages its global (manufacturing) footprint and makes adjustments to its sourcing base when needed.\n\nTo address the continued impact of COVID-19 uncertainty and its supply chain disruption, actions have been launched throughout the organization to secure the supply of components and to maximize the delivery of existing customer orders.\n\nSignify has built a supplier risk plan in which risky suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the geographical location of the supplier, the technologies and processes used. In addition, Signify is enhancing regional supply capabilities to increase the share of components needed for manufacturing products for a particular region are sourced regionally, as opposed to being sourced from remote locations.\n\nRegular risk assessments are carried out at individual plant level, including the risks related to natural catastrophes and water scarcity. These assessments are also performed at locations of business-critical suppliers and increasing strategic inventories. Signify requires its sites to have robust business continuity plans for any large-scale events which can severely impact the business.  These plans include sourcing from alternative suppliers and increasing strategic inventories.\n\nCost inflation due to the shortage of components, containers or labor is offset through a combination of cost savings and market price increases.  The level of pricing moves is benchmarked versus key competitors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also requires developing different capabilities and competences to commercialize its innovations successfully. In particular, this is important in a fast-changing market in which the company must continuously address the needs of local customers to introduce locally relevant new products and solutions ahead of competition.\n\nFailure to bring new products and solutions to the markets in a timely fashion and commercialize its innovations successfully would lead to the expected benefits of these investments may not outweigh the costs to the company, and would hence be detrimental to both the top and bottom line of the company.\n\nAs Signify becomes more digitalized, more devices and systems are connected online. This increases cyber security risk across enterprise IT, Operational Technology (OT) and our products and solutions that are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and accompanying (cloud-based) software applications.\n\nShould a successful cyber-attack materialize, the processes, services and systems that allow the organization to continue to operate could be impacted resulting in operational disruption. Further, a cyber-attack could cause a data breach where sensitive, protected, personal or confidential data held by Signify is leaked or stolen.\n\nSignify invests significantly in its R&D activities. It has dedicated R&D activities to support its divisions in developing and realizing near-term innovation roadmaps, and to develop longer-term innovations with a focus on areas such as connected lighting systems, software and digital applications.\n\nSignify adapted its business structure to enable a stronger customer focus and enhanced specialization to further increase execution speed. Finally, dedicated go-to-market channels and tailored marketing approaches are in place with the aim to successfully introduce new offerings commercially. The return on innovation investments is  reviewed on a quarterly basis, including speed to market, efficiency of investment and sales development versus plan.\n\nSignify develops its products and software applications and secures the ecosystem in conformity to security standards and best practices (ISA/ IEC62443, ISO2700x, NIST).\n\nCyber risk is reviewed by the Board of Management and by the Supervisory Board on a periodic basis. A dedicated cyber security team scans external developments, identifies inherent risks, and proposes plans to limit residual risk as much as possible. The Security Board aligns on the level of acceptable residual risk. Each year mandatory security and data protection & privacy awareness trainings are conducted.\n\nSecurity measures are in place to detect attackers and to minimize the risk of them causing damage to systems and gaining access to critical data, systems and services. Business continuity plans are in place in the event of nonavailability of IT systems and Manufacturing sites. These business continuity plans are tested periodically.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It reports on and is accountable for internal risk management and control systems to the Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee. The company has implemented a risk management and internal control system designed to provide reasonable assurance that strategic objectives are met by creating focus, integrating management control over the company's operations, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations and by safeguarding its assets and the reliability of its financial reporting and its disclosures.\n\nThe company has designed its internal control system based on the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nThe company's risk management approach is embedded in its periodic business planning and review cycle and forms an integral part of business management. On the basis of risk assessments, management determines the risks and appropriate responses related to the achievement of business objectives and critical business processes. Risk factors and the risk management approach are described in more detail in chapter 12, Risk factors and risk management, of this Annual Report. Audit results, relevant investigative activities as well as significant changes and improvements in the company's risk management and internal control system are discussed with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nWith respect to financial reporting, a structured self-assessment and monitoring process is used company-wide to assess, document, review and monitor compliance with internal control over financial reporting. Internal representations received from management, regular management reviews, reviews of the design and effectiveness of internal controls and reviews in company and Division, Market and Function Audit Committees, are integral parts of the company's risk management approach.\n\nOn the basis of the above, we confirm that:\n\n- \u00b7 The management report provides sufficient insights into failings, if any, in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems; and\n- \u00b7 The internal risk management and control systems provide a reasonable level of assurance that the financial reporting and tax included in this Annual Report does not contain any errors of material importance.\n\nIt should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide certainty as to the realization of operational and financial business objectives, nor can they prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and noncompliance with rules and regulations.\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\n## Board of Management\n\nEric Rondolat Javier van Engelen Maria Letizia Mariani\n\n<!-- image -->",

('the Company') and its subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 2:24b of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Board of Management of the Company and authorized for issue on February 22, 2022, and will be submitted for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 17, 2022. The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, including derivatives (measured at fair value), assets held for sale (measured at the lower of carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell), and definedbenefit pension plans (plan assets are measured at fair value).\n\n## Functional and presentational currency\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR), which is the functional and presentation currency of Signify N.V. All amounts are presented in EUR million and have been rounded to the nearest EUR million, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding, amounts may not add up to totals provided.\n\n## Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates inherently contain a degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThese estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current and expected future outcomes, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and",

Signify revises material estimates if changes occur in the circumstances or there is new information or experience on which an estimate was or can be based.\n\nThe areas where the most significant judgments and estimates are made are goodwill, deferred tax asset recoverability, revenue recognition, impairments, provisions, employee benefit obligations, inventory valuation and obsolescence provision, estimation of loss allowance for expected credit losses, leases, fair value of derivatives, other financial instruments and assets and liabilities in business combinations. For further discussion on these significant judgments and estimates, reference is made to the respective accounting policies and notes within these Consolidated financial statements that relate to the above topics.\n\n## Climate-related matters\n\nThe impact of climate change generates opportunities as well as challenges for Signify's existing and future lighting products and solutions portfolio. Sustainability is an integral part of Signify's 5 Frontiers strategy. Its strategic pillar, Growth for Sustainability, aims to address global challenges by focusing on sustainable growth areas, based on low-carbon technological innovation: Climate action, Circular economy, Food availability, Safety & security, and Health & well-being. As a result, Signify's product portfolio is well-positioned to anticipate risks and opportunities related to climate change.\n\n## Digital Solutions and Digital Products\n\nDigital Solutions and Digital Products benefit from the phasing out of conventional lighting and the move to more energy efficient LED and connected lighting. Stimulus packages, such as the EU Green Deal and US stimulus package, are pushing for the use of more sustainable technologies. This creates a multi-year opportunity for Signify, as its product portfolio is wellpositioned to capture growth from this drive for sustainability.\n\n## Conventional Products\n\nThe conventional market is expected to continue to decline in the coming years due to the ongoing adoption of LED lighting technologies and legislation banning certain technologies. The Division maintains a legislation-compliant portfolio and invests in remaining opportunities such as UV-C light sources and conventional horticulture lighting. The Division is successfully executing its last company standing strategy, strengthening its leadership position, increasing customer and employee Net Promoter Scores and being cash-contributing.\n\nDevelopments on climate-related matters for the Division were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the key assumptions used in the annual goodwill impairment test for Conventional Products have taken into account external market assumptions, including potential phase out of products due to market conditions and legislation likely to be ratified. In the 2021 annual goodwill test, the estimated recoverable amount of\n\nConventional Products exceeded its carrying value, therefore no impairment loss was recognized. For further details, refer to Note 15, Intangible assets.\n\n## Impact of supply chain disruptions\n\nDuring the year, component and container shortages as well as other logistics challenges impacted the global supply chain. As demand remained healthy, this resulted in a part of the orders being delayed. As a result, these challenges affected Signify's sales and inventory levels. Signify believes that these unprecedented supply chain issues are transitory and is confident in its ability to convert demand into sales growth as the situation stabilizes.\n\nThe increased inventory levels did not lead to a material change in the value allowance for inventory. The impact of supply chain disruptions and its recovery has been taken into account as part of the assumptions in the annual goodwill impairment test. For further details, refer to note 15, intangible assets.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation globally. From the outset, Signify has taken considerable action focused on the health and safety of its employees, on customer engagement, on supply chain continuity, on free cash flow generation, and operating expenses optimization.\n\nSignify continues to closely monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing the risks the pandemic poses for its market position, its financial results, its financial position and its cash flows. Signify implements mitigating actions promptly.\n\nFurther information and considerations regarding areas of significant judgments and estimates have been included below.\n\n## Liquidity and risk management\n\nSignify continues to place a great deal of focus on actions to preserve liquidity. These measures included, among others, ongoing savings in selling expenses, travel costs, procurement costs and continued rigorous management of working capital. During 2021, Signify also implemented actions to make its central organization leaner and to improve its performance culture.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter did not result in an impairment loss being recognized. The key assumptions of the goodwill impairment test include sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. All key assumptions were updated to reflect management's current best estimates, including the recovery of the global lighting market from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. For further details, refer to note 15, Intangible assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Intangible assets, other than goodwill\n\nSignify monitors changes in the economic environment which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, and performs an impairment test when an impairment trigger is identified. No material impairment was identified based on procedures performed.\n\n## Inventories\n\nSignify's inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In determining the appropriate level of value allowance, inventory health in certain businesses and markets due to COVID-19 were considered. In addition, current and potential excess inventory levels were analyzed, incorporating revised expectations of future demand for these items. Compared to the allowance as of December 31, 2020, no material change in the value allowance for inventory was identified as a result of these procedures.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nAccording to its accounting policy, Signify calculates the lifetime expected credit loss for Trade receivables utilizing a matrix model per country, where recoverability data and default probability per country are used as future-looking elements which address COVID-19 impact. Because the collection of Trade receivables was strong in 2021, Signify's expected credit loss allowance as of December 31, 2021, did not change materially when compared to the allowance as of December 31, 2020. Furthermore, the allowance for individually impaired receivables did not change materially compared to the allowance as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Post-employment benefits\n\nCOVID-19 impacted underlying assumptions of post-employment liabilities such as the interest rates and investment performance. Signify performed an updated quantification of the net defined benefit liability as at December 31, 2021, based on the most recent assumptions. Details of the underlying assumptions used can be found in note 25, Post-employment benefits.\n\n## Government support\n\nIn response to COVID-19, many governments provided support through incentives, changed tax policies aimed at deferring tax filings and payments, and/or tax relief measures. Apart from applied payment deferrals on other taxes/levies, the impact of government support received is not significant.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nIn the context of COVID-19, Signify has also assessed whether it is still probable that deferred tax assets recognized on the balance sheet will be realized. No derecognition as a result of this assessment was recorded.\n\n## Changes in accounting policy\n\n## New and amended standards adopted\n\nSignify has applied the following amendments for the first time to its annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IFRS 16 - COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IAS 16 - Proceeds before intended use of property, plant and equipment\n\nSignify changed its accounting policies in accordance with the amendments listed above. The changes did not have any significant impact on the amounts recognized in the prior period and current period.\n\n## New and amended standards not yet adopted\n\nSeveral new standards or amendments to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for reporting periods commencing on or after January 1, 2022. With the exception of the amendment to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, these standards have not been adopted early by Signify. The new standards or amendments are not expected to have a material impact on Signify in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to Signify. Signify measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus\n- \u00b7 the recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; plus\n- \u00b7 if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less\n- \u00b7 the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nSignify's investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. Investments in associates are those entities in which Signify has significant influence, but no control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Signify entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency').\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation when items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income, except when deferred in Other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. The exchange differences are presented as part of Cost of sales, except for tax items and Financial income and expense, which are recognized in the same line item as they relate to.\n\nUpon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of non-euro entities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments at the time of the acquisition, are translated into euros at the year-end rates of exchange. The items of the statement of income of foreign activities, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated at the rates which are approximating the rates at the dates of transactions. The resulting translation differences of the net investments in foreign operations are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the goods. For standard sale of products, control generally passes to the customer when the product is delivered and accepted, depending on the delivery conditions and incoterms. For products for which a right to return exists during a defined period, revenue is recognized by considering the historical pattern of actual returns. Return policies are typically based on customary return arrangements in local markets.\n\n## Sale of services\n\nSignify accounts for cloud-enabled services, extended warranties and lifecycle services as separate performance obligations. Control over these services is transferred over time and revenue is recognized, in most cases, on a straight-line basis over the duration of the service period.\n\n## Transaction price\n\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which Signify expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The transaction price excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the total consideration of the contract is allocated to all distinct performance obligations in the contract based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on other stand-alone sales transactions that are directly observable, when possible. However, observable prices are not\n\n<!-- image -->",

If no direct observable prices are available, the standalone selling price is normally based on the expected cost plus a margin approach.\n\nThe transaction price may be variable due to discounts, rebates or similar arrangements. Revenue is only recognized for the part of the consideration for which it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Judgment is required in determining the probability and level of discounts and rebates that will be granted. The estimate is updated throughout the term of the contract.\n\nSignify does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of significant financing component if, at contract inception, it is expected that the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is one year or less. This applies to most sales transactions.\n\n## Other\n\nPayments made to customers for distinct goods or services are excluded from revenue recognized and recorded as part of Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nSignify may incur costs for obtaining a contract, including payments made to agents that depend on winning the contract. Signify applies the practical expedient from IFRS 15, allowing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract to be expensed if the associated amortization period is 12 months or less. As a result, no amounts of contract costs are recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets mostly comprise of unbilled positions, where Signify has, partially or in full, satisfied performance obligations but not yet billed the customer. These are recorded under either Other current assets or Other non-current assets. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional, which is mostly when the customer is billed.\n\nContract liabilities consist of deferred income and payments received in advance and are recorded under Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities. Deferred income includes balances related to extended warranty, life-cycle services as well as other services such as cloud-enabled services. Advances from customers mostly comprises payments received in advance for projects, for which Signify still needs to satisfy (part of) the performance obligations.\n\n## Income and expenses\n\nSignify applies accrual accounting. This means that expenses are recognized when incurred and Income is recognized when earned, irrespective of the actual cash flows.\n\nConsideration received from customers for shipping and handling is recognized as Sales. Shipping and handling expenses related to sales to third parties are generally recorded as Selling, general and administrative expenses. When shipping and handling are distinct performance obligations, then the related expenses are recorded as Cost of sales.\n\nAdvertising and promotion costs and costs related to the brand license fee are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The costs of conversion of inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable production overheads, considering the stage of completion and the normal capacity of production facilities. Costs of idle facility and abnormal waste are expensed. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Due to price erosion and technological developments, inventory valuation requires forward looking estimates on future sales levels, future price erosion and related expected gross margin percentages. On each reporting date, management performs an analysis of net realizable values and determines the lower of cost and net realizable value to measure its inventories. The write-down is included in Cost of sales.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition\n\nA financial asset or liability is recognized when Signify becomes party to a contract that is a financial instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are accounted for at the trade date. Initial measurement of financial assets and liabilities is at fair value. Dividend income is recognized when declared.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on Signify's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows and solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test. Signify performs the analysis instrument by instrument, utilizing contract details, business model and objective of the instrument in order to classify financial asset or liability into one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at amortized cost as the business model for these instruments is hold-tocollect contractual cash flows. These are mainly Trade and Other Receivables, which are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance and net of discounts given or agreed if the offset requirements are met.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value via profit and loss (FVPL), as the business model for these instruments is held for trading. Derivatives and other financial assets at fair value are Included in this category.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) with no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment as the business model for these instruments is hold-tocollect contractual cash flows and sell. Minor equity investments are included in this category.\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are all classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value via profit and loss. Examples are derivatives, contingent consideration in a business acquisition, to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value with changes recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nSignify presents financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis as separate line items in the Consolidated statement of financial position, unless the offset criteria are met.\n\nThe offsetting criteria are met if Signify has a legal right to offset financial assets with financial liabilities and if Signify intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. To meet the requirement, the right of set-off should be available today and not contingent on a future event and it should be legally enforceable for all counterparties in a normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired\n\nor\n\n- \u00b7 Signify has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) Signify has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, Signify continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, Signify also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that Signify has retained.\n\n## Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nSignify estimates lifetime expected loss allowance for all Trade receivables and Contract assets via calculating the expected credit losses. Trade receivables and contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due whereby the lifetime expected credit loss on the Trade receivables is recognized based on a matrix model calculated per country, which utilizes historical recoverability data and default probability per country.\n\nAs soon as individual trade accounts receivable can no longer be collected in a normal course of business and are expected to result in a loss, they are designated as doubtful trade accounts receivable and valued at the expected collectible amounts. They are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectable because of bankruptcy or other form of receivership at the debtors. Any previously recognized expected loss is offset against the carrying amount of such trade receivable and the difference is taken as a loss accounted for within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Impairment of other financial assets\n\nSignify assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its debt instruments carried at amortized cost. Signify determines impairment amount based on the three stages of credit risk deterioration. The criteria to pass on to the next stage of the credit deterioration Is established for individual financial assets or group of financial assets with similar characteristics, considering credit risk profile of the counterparty, historical default data and macroeconomic factors.\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, Signify documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. Signify documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.\n\nFor foreign currency forwards, Signify designates the spot component of the change in fair value in cash flow hedge relationships. The spot component is determined with reference to the relevant spot market exchange rates. The differential between the contracted forward rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as forward points. It is discounted, where material. Changes in the fair value related to forward points are continuously recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nSignify hedges its investments in certain subsidiaries by entering derivatives which mitigate the foreign currency translation risk arising from the subsidiaries net assets. Such hedge is accounted for as a net investment hedge. Signify designates full instrument in the hedge relationship. The result of hedging of the translation risk, using net investment hedges is recognized in the Currency translation differences within equity, as can be seen in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as long as the hedge is effective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These calculations are tested for reasonableness by comparing the outcome of the internal valuation with the valuation received from the counterparty.\n\nSignify monitors that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and hedge ratio is the same as the one Signify uses for the risk management purposes. A prospective effectiveness test is performed to prove that the hedge is effective. For the prospective effectiveness test Signify utilizes the dollar offset method.\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal due to the different timing or amount of the underlying transaction, but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, Signify performs re-balancing of the hedge relationship by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item, so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for the risk management purposes. Gains and losses that were accumulated in equity related to an ineffective portion of hedge, Signify records immediately in the Consolidated statement of income when such ineffectiveness occurs.\n\nThe derivatives related to transactions are, for hedge accounting purposes, split into hedges of on-balance-sheet accounts receivable/payable and forecasted sales and purchases. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized within the Cost of sales in the Consolidated statement of income, except for derivatives that are effective and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which are recorded in Other comprehensive income until the Consolidated statement of income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Changes in the fair value of hedges related to intercompany loans and deposits are recognized within Financial income and expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe derivatives used by Signify can be subject to master netting and set-off agreements with financial counterparties. In case of certain termination events, under the terms of these Master Agreements, Signify can terminate the outstanding transactions and aggregate their positive and negative values to arrive at a single net termination sum (or close-out amount). This contractual right is, amongst others, subject to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The right may be limited by local law if the counterparty is subject to bankruptcy proceedings.\n- \u00b7 The right applies on a bilateral basis.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly within equity or in Other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the\n\ntaxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially-enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the balance sheet method, for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the income is to be paid out as dividend in the foreseeable future and for undistributed earnings of unconsolidated companies to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable or deductible.\n\nChanges in tax rates are reflected in the period when the change has been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. The evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires judgment about the future taxable profitability of the legal entity holding the tax loss carry forward. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A lack of future taxable profits or taxable profits below the level of current estimates, may cause deferred tax assets to be impaired.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe ultimate tax effects of transactions may be uncertain for a considerable period of time, requiring management to estimate the related current and deferred tax treatments. In assessing the uncertainty, Signify considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept or revise the uncertain tax treatment. Income tax payable include liabilities for uncertain tax positions which are recognized when it is probable that tax will be due. To the extent uncertain tax positions relate to deferred tax assets these are offset against each other. Actual tax assessments in relation to these uncertain tax positions may significantly deviate from estimates.\n\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, Signify takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes Signify to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized if, as a result of a past event, Signify has a present legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of time value of money. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. Significant judgment is required in determining the amount and probability of resources outflow and discount rates used to calculate the present value of this outflow. A liability is recognized if timing and amount of the settlement can be reliably estimated.\n\nThe accounting and presentation for some of Signify's provisions is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring related provisions - The provision for restructuring relates to the estimated costs of programs that are planned and controlled by management that materially change the scope of our business or the manner in which it is conducted. A provision is recognized when Signify has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation that Signify will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan, or by announcing the plan's main features to those affected by it.\n- \u00b7 Environmental provisions - Measurement of liabilities associated with environmental obligations is based on current legal and constructive requirements. Liabilities and expected insurance recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. The carrying amount of environmental provisions is regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts and changes in law.\n- \u00b7 Product warranty - A provision for product warranty is made at the time of revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to the products. The provision is based on\n\nhistorical warranty data and a weighing of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.\n\n- \u00b7 Litigation provisions - In relation to legal claim provisions and settlements, the relevant balances are transferred to Other liabilities at the point the amount and timing of cash flows are no longer uncertain. Settlements which are agreed for amounts in excess of existing provisions are reflected as payables.\n- \u00b7 Onerous contract provisions - Provisions are recognized for a contract if it is onerous. The present obligation under the contract is measured and recognized as a provision. An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWhen the potential cash outflow is possible or remote and the risk covered by a guarantee is not a financial risk, Signify applies off-balance sheet treatment to such guarantees. For example, environmental remediation and legal proceedings. When the expectation of the cash outflow becomes probable such guarantees become provisions, see guidance above.\n\nWhen guarantees are covering credit risk or any other financial risk they are accounted for as financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Leases\n\nSignify entered into contracts that conveys the right to use the identified asset and as such Signify accounted for these contracts as a lessee.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nSignify recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless Signify is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, Signify recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include (in-substance) fixed payments (less any lease incentives), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nexercised by Signify and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects Signify exercising the option to terminate. In calculating the present value of lease payments, Signify uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nSignify applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases for real estate (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Significant judgment in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n\nSignify determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. When determining the lease term, Signify considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. These circumstances include Signify's strategic plans, the industrial footprint of Signify and divisions and the importance of the site to Signify's operations.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is described under accounting policy, Business combinations, above. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of investments in associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such investment is allocated to the investment as a whole.\n\n## Intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nThe fair value of other intangible assets, mainly customer relations, brand names and technology based intangibles acquired through business combinations is determined using a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of an asset based on market participants' expectations of the cash flows associated with that asset over its remaining useful life. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The useful lives are evaluated annually. Intangible assets are initially capitalized at cost, with the\n\nexception of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value.\n\nExpenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalized as an intangible asset if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, cost can be reliably measured, Signify has sufficient resources and the intention to complete development.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized comprises all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Other development expenditures and expenditures on research activities are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. Capitalized development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization of capitalized development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated statement of income on a straight- line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets in Research and development expenses.\n\nAmortization of other intangible assets is reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses for brand names and customer relationships and in Cost of sales for technologybased and other intangible assets.\n\nThe expected useful lives in years of intangible assets excluding goodwill are as follows:\n\n| Product development   | from 1 to 5   |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Software              | from 1 to 10  |\n| Technology            | from 1 to 20  |\n| Customer relations    | from 2 to 20  |\n| Brand names           | from 2 to 20  |\n| Other                 | from 2 to 10  |\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized but tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require impairment testing. Signify performed and completed annual impairment tests in the last quarter of the financial year. Judgment is required when analyzing impairments triggers and tests of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use. These analyses are based on the estimation of the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income whenever and to the extent that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the unit's recoverable amount, which is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset is deemed not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of impairment are recognized in the Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Pension and other employee benefits\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nSignify's retirement benefit obligation is calculated by an independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method. This calculation is performed separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the benefit that employees have earned in relation to their past services. The measurement date for all defined benefit plans is December 31. For plans with a relatively low defined-benefit obligation, Signify may decide to calculate the defined-benefit obligation with a lower frequency. The liability recognized in the Consolidated statement of financial position is the present value of these benefits at the end of the reporting period (defined-benefit obligation) less the fair value of plan assets. The defined-benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a discount yield curve of highquality corporate bonds with durations matching the terms of the benefits.\n\nThe increase in the defined-benefit obligation due to the passage of time and the expected return on plan assets, using the same interest rate as for the defined-benefit obligation, are included in the pension costs. Interest on the net defined-benefit obligation is recognized in Financing income and expenses in the Consolidated income statement.\n\nPast-service costs are recognized immediately in the Personnel costs in the Consolidated income statement. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity via other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\n\nWhen a plan is changed, settled or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in the definedbenefit obligation that relates to past-service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in the statement of income. Signify recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\nSignify presents all net defined-benefit post-employment obligations on one line within noncurrent liabilities on the Statement of financial position.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nContributions to defined-contribution plans are recognized in the Consolidated income statement in Personnel expenses as incurred.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by Signify before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Signify recognizes termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to a termination and when they have a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current employees without possibility of withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nSignify's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such as jubilee entitlements. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis. Signify recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and incentives based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to Signify's shareholders after certain adjustments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts form an integral part of Signify's cash management and often fluctuate from being positive to overdrawn and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets (disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Comparatives in the balance sheet are not changed when a non-current asset is classified as held-for-sale.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nWhen the economy of a country in which Signify operates is deemed hyperinflationary and the functional currency of a Signify entity is the currency of that hyperinflationary economy, the financial statements of such entity are adjusted so that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. This involves restatement of income and expenses to reflect changes in the general price index from the start of the reporting period and restatement of non-monetary items in the balance sheet, such as property, plant and equipment and inventory to reflect current purchasing power as at the period end using a general price index from the date when they were first recognized. Comparative amounts are not adjusted. Any differences arising were recorded in equity on adoption.\n\n## Equity\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Dividends are recognized as a liability in the period in which they are declared. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\nTreasury shares that are reacquired are recognized at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date, and deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued. When reissued, shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. When treasury shares are delivered under Signify's share plans, the difference between the market price of the shares delivered and the cost is recorded in retained earnings, the market price is recorded in share premium. Upon cancellation, treasury shares are deducted from the share capital at their nominal value of EUR 0.01 per share and retained earnings for the difference.\n\nCosts including dividend withholding tax in connection with Signify's purchase of treasury shares for capital reduction purposes are recorded in retained earnings.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives and residual values are evaluated annually. The costs of property, plant and equipment comprise of all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Government grants for assets are deducted from the cost of the related asset.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is calculated using the straight-line method taking into account the residual values and estimated useful lives and is primarily included in Cost of sales. Freehold land is not depreciated. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in Other business income. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless leading to an extension of the original lifetime of capacity.\n\nThe expected useful lives in years of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Building                    | from 5 to 50   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| Machinery and installations | from 3 to 20   |\n| Other equipment             | from 1 to 10   |\n| Right-of-use assets         | from 2 to 20   |\n\n## Share-based compensation expenses\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.\n\nThe grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as personnel expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the award. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period.\n\nService and non-market performance conditions are not considered when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value.\n\nNo expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash flows from derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Cash flows from other derivative instruments are classified consistent with the nature of the instrument. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated into euros using the exchange rate at the date of the cash flow.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nSignify presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Signify N.V. by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprises of restricted shares, conditional shares and performance shares granted to employees.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and Signify will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the Consolidated statement of income over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.\n\n## 3 Information by segment and main country\n\nOperating segments are components of Signify's business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Board of Management of Signify). The operating segments are Digital Solutions, Digital Products and Conventional Products. The segments are organized based on the nature of the products and services. 'Other' represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes certain costs related to central R&D activities to drive innovation as well as group enabling functions.\n\nThe following is an overview of Signify revenues and results by segment:\n\n|                                         | Digital Solutions  5   | Digital Products   | Conventional Products Other   | 4     | Inter- segment elimination   | Signify   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------|------------------------------|-----------|\n| 2021                                    |                        |                    |                               |       |                              |           |\n| Sales to external customers             | 3,524                  | 2,452              | 861                           | 23    |                              | 6,860     |\n| Sales including                         |                        |                    |                               |       |                              |           |\n| intersegment                            | 3,527                  | 2,673              | 868                           | 22    | (230)                        | 6,860     |\n| Depreciation and  amortization  1       | (79)                   | (28)               | (18)                          | (65)  |                              | (190)     |\n| EBITA  2                                | 318                    | 323                | 158                           | (164) |                              | 636       |\n| EBITA as a % of sales                   | 9.0%                   | 13.2%              | 18.4%                         |       |                              | 9.3%      |\n| Amortization  3                         |                        |                    |                               |       |                              | (122)     |\n| Income from operations                  | 205                    | 316                | 158                           | (165) |                              | 514       |\n| Financial income and  expenses          |                        |                    |                               |       |                              | (24)      |\n| Results from investments in  associates |                        |                    |                               |       |                              | -         |\n| Income before taxes                     |                        |                    |                               |       |                              | 490       |\n\n## 2020\n\n| Sales to external customers             | 3,252   | 2,288   | 943   | 19    |       | 6,502   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Sales including                         |         |         |       |       |       |         |\n| intersegment                            | 3,255   | 2,455   | 949   | 20    | (178) | 6,502   |\n| Depreciation and  1                     |         |         |       |       |       | (211)   |\n| amortization                            | (81)    | (30)    | (30)  | (71)  |       |         |\n| EBITA  2                                | 230     | 277     | 149   | (120) |       | 536     |\n| EBITA as a % of sales                   | 7.1%    | 12.1%   | 15.8% |       |       | 8.2%    |\n| Amortization  3                         |         |         |       |       |       | (120)   |\n| Income from operations                  | 119     | 269     | 149   | (122) |       | 416     |\n| Financial income and                    |         |         |       |       |       |         |\n| expenses                                |         |         |       |       |       | (54)    |\n| Results from investments in  associates |         |         |       |       |       | -       |\n| Income before taxes                     |         |         |       |       |       | 362     |\n\n- 3 Amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill.\n- 4 Considering the nature of Other, EBITA as a % of sales for Other is not meaningful.\n- 5 Includes Cooper Lighting from March, 2020.",

The difference is primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets as a result of Signify's determination that sufficient positive evidence exists to support a probable estimation that these deferred tax assets are realizable, one-off non-cash tax benefits from a business integration, offset by an increase of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\n\nThe line item \"Changes in tax rates\" includes a non-cash tax benefit of EUR 7 million related to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets following the planned statutory tax rate increase in the Netherlands. The effects of tax rate changes are included in the reported tax balances based on the information available per reporting date.\n\nThe increase in effective income tax rate in 2021 of 9% compared to 2020 is mainly due to lower non-cash benefits from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and business integration. For 2020, the impact of business integration  is included in the \"Tax incentives and exempt income\" line offset by \"changes in the liability for uncertain tax positions\" and \"changes in tax rates\". In addition, for 2020 the line item \"Changes in tax rates\" includes a non-cash tax benefit of EUR 32 million related to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets following the cancellation of the planned statutory tax rate decrease in the Netherlands.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Management's projections support the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate enough taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets.\n\nMovement in deferred tax balances during 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n| In millions of EUR                                           | Balance  as at  January 1   | Recognized  in income   | Other   | Balance  as at  December 31   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| 2021                                                         |                             |                         |         |                               |\n| Intangible assets                                            | 188                         | (12)                    | (7)     | 169                           |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                | (23)                        | (14)                    | 5       | (32)                          |\n| Inventories                                                  | 39                          | 4                       | 5       | 48                            |\n| Other receivables                                            | 32                          | (16)                    | (1)     | 15                            |\n| Provisions:                                                  |                             |                         |         |                               |\n| \u00b7 pensions and other post-retirement                         |                             |                         |         |                               |\n| benefits                                                     | 66                          | (7)                     | (1)     | 58                            |\n| \u00b7 termination benefits                                       | 9                           | (2)                     | (1)     | 6                             |\n| \u00b7 other provisions                                           | 29                          | 11                      | 1       | 41                            |\n| Other liabilities                                            | 56                          | 11                      | 8       | 75                            |\n| Tax loss carryforwards (including tax credit  carryforwards) | 55                          | 18                      | 1       | 73                            |\n| Net deferred tax assets                                      | 452                         | (7)                     | 9       | 454                           |\n\n## 2020\n\n| Intangible assets                                            | 44   | 144   | 1    | 188   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|------|-------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                                | (29) | 6     | -    | (23)  |\n| Inventories                                                  | 42   | -     | (3)  | 39    |\n| Other receivables                                            | 43   | (8)   | (3)  | 32    |\n| Provisions: \u00b7 pensions and other post-retirement  benefits   | 73   | (3)   | (4)  | 66    |\n| \u00b7 termination benefits                                       | 8    | 3     | (1)  | 9     |\n| \u00b7 other provisions                                           | 32   | (1)   | (2)  | 29    |\n| Other liabilities                                            | 53   | 4     | (1)  | 56    |\n| Tax loss carryforwards (including tax credit  carryforwards) | 90   | (32)  | (3)  | 55    |\n| Net deferred tax assets                                      | 356  | 112   | (16) | 452   |",

These uncertainties include, among others, the following:\n\n## Transfer pricing uncertainties\n\nSignify has issued transfer pricing directives, which are in accordance with international guidelines, such as those of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As transfer pricing has a cross-border effect, potential adjustments by local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country. In order to reduce the transfer pricing uncertainties, monitoring procedures are carried out by Group Tax and Internal Audit to safeguard the correct implementation of the transfer pricing directives.\n\n## Tax uncertainties on general and specific service agreements and licensing agreements\n\nDue to the centralization of certain activities in a limited number of countries (such as research and development, IT, group functions and head office), costs are also centralized. Consequently, these costs and/or revenues must be allocated to the beneficiaries, i.e. the various Signify entities. This could lead to discussions with local tax authorities if they do not accept these charges. For that purpose, service contracts such as intra-group service agreements and licensing agreements are signed with Signify group entities. Tax authorities review these intra-group service and licensing agreements and may reject the implemented intra-group charges.\n\n## Tax uncertainties due to permanent establishments\n\nSignify may encounter tax uncertainties, due to permanent establishments in countries where new operations are started or business models are altered. This is because when operations in a country involve a foreign Signify organization, there is a risk that tax claims will arise in the former country as well as in the latter country.\n\nWhen Signify has cross-border operations, there is a risk that tax claims will arise in all relevant countries.\n\nAssessing the amount of tax liabilities for these tax uncertainties is highly judgmental and the timing of possible outflows, if any, is uncertain. Signify has considered the merits of its filing position in its overall evaluation of potential tax liabilities and believes it has adequate tax liabilities recorded in its consolidated financial statements for exposures on these matters. Based on its evaluation of the potential tax liabilities and the merits of Signify's filing positions, it is unlikely that potential tax exposures over the amounts currently recorded as liabilities in its\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, related to similar uncertainties, an indemnification liability to Koninklijke Philips N.V. of EUR 52 million (2020: EUR 51 million) and an indemnification receivable of EUR 10 million (2020: EUR 13 million) is recorded. The total net indemnification liability increased in 2021 by EUR 4 million mainly due to settlements and expirations. Tax uncertainties also include exposures with a risk assessment which are deemed lower than probable, but possible. The best estimate of the maximum amount in connection with these uncertainties is EUR 121 million. Signify believes that in connection with these uncertainties it is probable that no additional taxes will be due. Therefore, no income tax payable is recognized.\n\n## 10 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                                                 | 2020        | 2021        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net income attributable to shareholders of Signify N.V.                                                         | 325         | 397         |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding  (after deduction of treasury shares) during the year    | 126,223,168 | 124,966,505 |\n| Plus incremental shares assumed from conversions of:                                                            |             |             |\n| \u00b7 Performance shares                                                                                            | 2,669,282   | 2,828,996   |\n| \u00b7 Conditional shares                                                                                            | 676,799     | 710,721     |\n| \u00b7 Restricted shares                                                                                             | 122,254     | 139,716     |\n| Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares  outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) during the |             |             |\n| year                                                                                                            | 129,691,502 | 128,645,938 |\n| in EUR                                                                                                          |             |             |\n| \u00b7 Basic                                                                                                         | 2.58        | 3.18        |\n| \u00b7 Diluted                                                                                                       | 2.51        | 3.09        |\n\n## 11 Acquisitions and divestments\n\nOn July 1, 2021, Signify completed the acquisition of 100% interest in Telensa Holdings Limited, a UK-based expert in wireless monitoring and control systems for smart cities. The acquisition involved a total consideration of EUR 31 million resulting in EUR 17 million goodwill and EUR 13 million intangible assets. Telensa Holdings Limited is consolidated within Digital Solutions. The acquisition is considered not material to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn December 20, 2021, Signify announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with ams OSRAM to acquire Austin, Texas-based Fluence for USD 272 million (EUR 242 million) on a cash and debt-free basis. This acquisition will strengthen Signify's global Agriculture lighting growth platform and extend its position in the North American horticultural lighting market.  It will operate as an entity within Signify's agricultural lighting business in Division Digital Solutions. Fluence employs more than 200 people.

The cashgenerating units correspond to the operating segments.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit Digital Solutions is considered to be significant in comparison to the total book value of goodwill of Signify at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021. The goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, is presented below.\n\n|                       | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Digital Solutions     | 1,902  | 2,089  |\n| Digital Products      | 296    | 315    |\n| Conventional Products | 53     | 59     |\n| Book value            | 2,251  | 2,464  |\n\nThe basis of the recoverable amount used of the cash-generating units is the value in use. In the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated recoverable amount of the cash-generating units tested exceeded the carrying value of the units. Therefore, no impairment loss was recognized.\n\nKey assumptions used in the impairment tests for the units were sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. These cash flow projections cover an initial period with specific estimates from 2022 to 2024. Projections were extrapolated with declining growth rates for a period of five years, after which a terminal value was calculated. The sales growth rates and EBITA used to estimate cash flows are based on past performance, external market growth assumptions, taking into account current market conditions, and industry long-term growth averages.\n\nFor Digital Solutions, EBITA is expected to increase over the projection period as a result of volume growth, cost efficiencies, and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Cash flow projections for 2021 and 2020 were based on the key assumptions included in the table below:\n\n## Key assumptions in %\n\n|                        | Compound sales growth rate  1   | Compound sales growth rate  1   | Compound sales growth rate  1   | Compound sales growth rate  1   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                        | Initial forecast  period  2     | Extra polation  period          | Used to  calculate              | Pre-tax                         |\n|                        |                                 |                                 | terminal value                  | discount rates                  |\n| Digital Solutions 2021 | 12.2                            | 2.6                             | 0.3                             | 11.0                            |\n| Digital Solutions 2020 | 9.7                             | 3.6                             | 0.3                             | 11.2                            |\n\nThe impairment test of Q4 2021 assumes the electronic components shortage will resolve over the course of 2022, and a recovery of the global lighting market to its pre-COVID-19 projected level by 2024. In addition, Signify performed a sensitivity analysis and noted that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions will not result in an impairment.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThe additions for 2021 contain internally generated assets of EUR 21 million for product development and EUR 11 million for software. In 2021, acquired other intangible assets are Customer relationships of EUR 5 million, Technology based of EUR 4 million, Brand names of EUR 2 million, and other intangible assets EUR 1 million which all relate to Telensa Holdings Limited.\n\nThe capitalized product development costs and software, for which amortization has not yet commenced, amounted to EUR 27 million as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: EUR 22 million).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of the customer relationships originating from the Genlyte acquisition in 2007 was EUR 37 million (USD 42 million) with a remaining amortization period of 1.1 years (2020: EUR 66 million, USD 81 million; 2.1 years). The carrying amount of the customer relationships originating from the Cooper Lighting acquisition in 2021 was EUR 288 million (USD 326 million) with a remaining amortization period of 18.8 years (2020: EUR 286 million, USD 352 million; 19.8 years).",

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding long-term loans amounting to EUR 280 million maturing in November 2024 and USD 225 million maturing in January 2025. In addition, the revolving credit facility (RCF) of EUR 500 million was extended to January 2027.\n\nThe EUR term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on the relevant applicable EURIBOR plus a fixed margin of 0.15%. The USD term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on the relevant applicable USD LIBOR with zero floor plus a margin. As of December 31, 2021, the margin on the USD term loan was 0.75% and is subject to change, depending on the public credit rating of Signify assigned by rating agencies.\n\nThe term loans and RCF agreement include a financial covenant providing that Signify maintains a net leverage ratio of no greater than 3.5x. The net leverage ratio may temporarily increase to 4.0x within 12 months of the closing of material acquisitions. The covenant does not apply if Signify has at least one investment grade rating, which is currently the case, as Signify has two investment grade ratings.\n\n## Eurobonds\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Signify had outstanding EUR 675 million of fixed rate notes due in May 2024 with an annual coupon of 2.000% and EUR 600 million of fixed rate notes due in May 2027 with an annual coupon of 2.375%.",

As at December 31, 2021, the provision relates primarily to the restructuring of the central organization and programs in Division Conventional Products and is mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. Signify expects the provision will be utilized mainly within next year.\n\n## Environmental provision\n\nSignify is exposed to environment risks, mainly because it has been in the business of manufacturing products for more than a century. During that period, Signify has opened, discontinued and acquired many manufacturing plants and sites. Some of these plants and sites have been used for industrial purposes for decades and as such, there is a latent risk that these premises may have environmental conditions that require corrective actions as a result of such use. The environmental provisions include accrued costs recorded with respect to environmental remediation in various countries. Provisions for environmental remediation can change significantly due to the emergence of additional information regarding the extent or nature of the contamination, the need to utilize alternative technologies, actions by regulatory authorities as well as changes in judgments and discount rates. The environmental provision is expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n## Product warranty\n\nManufacturing of Signify's products involves complex processes and defects might occur. In addition, it is possible that some of Signify's products may not perform as expected (for example, in terms of estimated life span and projected energy savings). These defects or shortfalls may cause Signify to incur significant warranty, support and replacement costs. The provision for product warranty reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to products sold. Signify expects the provision will be mainly utilized within the next two years.\n\n## Other\n\nSignify and certain of its group companies are involved in legal proceedings relating to such matters as product liability and claims for property damage and personal injury, alleged to have been caused by failure or malfunction of its products as well as commercial transactions, and intellectual property infringements (among others). The outcome of asserted claims and proceedings, or the impact of any claims that may be asserted in the future, cannot be predicted with certainty. Signify makes provisions if payments with respect to such matters are probable and the amount can be estimated reliably. Furthermore, other provisions mainly comprise of provisions for self-insurance, decommissioning and provision for employee jubilee funds. Other provisions are expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 25 Post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment benefits covered in this note relate to defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, including defined-benefit retiree medical plans. The benefits provided by these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation levels. Employee post-employment defined-benefit plans have been established in several countries in accordance with the legal requirements, customs and local practice.\n\n## Net defined-benefit liabilities per country\n\n|                 | 2020       | 2020         | 2020           | 2021       | 2021         | 2021           |\n|-----------------|------------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                 | Obligation | Plan  assets | Net  Liability | Obligation | Plan  assets | Net  Liability |\n| Germany         | 227        | (15)         | 212            | 208        | (15)         | 193            |\n| Unites States   | 579        | (485)        | 94             | 563        | (475)        | 88             |\n| Other countries | 153        | (69)         | 84             | 133        | (51)         | 82             |\n| Total countries | 959        | (569)        | 390            | 904        | (541)        | 363            |\n\n## United States\n\nThe defined-benefit Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan in the US covers certain hourly workers and salaried workers hired before January 1, 2005 and has a net liability of EUR 14 million. The plan is closed for new entrants and since 2016 no further benefit accruals are taking place. Employees only accrue benefits in a defined-contribution plan. Signify pays the administration cost and contributions to cover the funding deficit of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan. The plan assets are governed by an Investment Committee. Signify also has an unfunded pension plan in place for higher salaried employees with a net liability of EUR 20 million and a post-retirement welfare plan with a net liability of EUR 54 million.\n\nSignify reviewed the funding level of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan and decided that it would not make a contribution in 2021 and neither expects to make a contribution in 2022. Signify expects cash outflows of EUR 8 million in 2022 for the unfunded plans.\n\nFor the funding of the deficit of the US Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan, Signify adheres to the minimum funding requirements of the US Pension Protection Act.\n\n## Germany\n\nFor employees with a salary above a certain salary threshold, there is a funded defined-benefit pension plan which has a deficit of EUR 8 million. This plan has been closed for new entrants since January 1, 2018. Since 2016, Signify no longer makes any contributions to this plan but funds the liabilities when these are paid out to retirees. New employees accrue pension benefits through a defined-contribution plan. For other closed defined-benefit plans, Signify had an unfunded liability of EUR 184 million as at December 31, 2021. Signify expects cash outflows of EUR 17 million in 2022 for the pension plans.\n\nCash outflows for the defined-benefit plans in countries other than the USA and Germany are expected to total EUR 10 million in 2022.\n\n## Risks related to defined-benefit plans\n\nThe defined-benefit plans expose Signify to various demographic and economic risks, such as longevity, investment, currency and interest rate risks and, in some cases, inflation risk. The latter plays a role in the assumed wage increase and in some smaller plans where indexation is mandatory.\n\nThe larger plans are governed by either independent boards, committees or trustees who have a legal obligation to evenly balance the interests of all stakeholders and operate under the local regulatory frameworks. These boards and trustees are responsible for and have full discretion over the investment strategy of the plan assets, in general they manage pension fund risks by diversifying the investments of plan assets and by (partially) matching interest rate risk of liabilities.\n\nSignify has an active de-risking strategy in which it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its defined-benefit plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Plan assets in 2021 do not include property occupied by or financial instruments issued by Signify.\n\nSome 88% of the total plan assets of the Signify pension plan are in the US and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio. The interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio of the US qualified pension plan is closely aligned to that of the plan's pension liabilities. The remaining 12% of the total plan assets is mainly the market value of insured pension benefits.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThe mortality tables used for Signify's major schemes are:\n\n- \u00b7 US: Base table PRI-2012 White Collar mortality table, projected forward with future mortality improvements according to Scale MP-2021.\n- \u00b7 Germany: Richttafeln 2018 G K. Heubeck.\n\nThe weighted averages of the assumptions used to calculate the defined-benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n## In %\n\n|                           |   2020 |   2021 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate             |    1.9 |    2.3 |\n| Pension cost increases    |    0.4 |    0.4 |\n| Healthcare cost increases |    0.4 |    0.5 |\n| Wage increases            |    0.4 |    0.4 |\n\nThe average duration of the defined-benefit obligation of the defined-benefit plans is 9.3 years. For the defined-benefit plans in the US and Germany, the average duration is respectively 9.1 years and 8.9 years. The average discount rates for the plans in these countries are respectively 2.6% and 0.8%. The pension cost increase rate assumption for the German defined-benefit plans is 1.75%.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe table below illustrates the approximate impact on the defined-benefit obligation if Signify were to change key assumptions. The defined-benefit obligation was recalculated using a change of 1% in the respective assumptions which overall is considered a reasonably possible change. The impact on the defined-benefit obligation of changes in discount rate is for funded plans normally accompanied by offsetting movements in plan assets, especially when using matching strategies.\n\n|                                         | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Increase                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | (88)   | (80)   |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | 7      | 11     |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | 22     | 19     |\n| Longevity (see explanation)             | 32     | 40     |\n| Healthcare cost change (1% movement)    | 6      | 6      |\n| Decrease                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | 102    | 91     |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | (6)    | (9)    |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | (20)   | (21)   |\n\nLongevity also impacts the post-employment defined-benefit obligation. In the above sensitivity table, the impact on the defined-benefit obligation of a further 10% decrease in the assumed rates of mortality for Signify's major schemes is illustrated. A 10% decrease in assumed mortality rates equals improvement of life expectancy by six months to a year.\n\n## 26 Related party transactions\n\nSignify considers the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to be key management personnel as defined in IAS 24 'Related parties'. For remuneration details of Key Management, see note 28, Information on remuneration.\n\n## 27 Share-based compensation\n\nThe total share-based compensation costs for the period ended December 31, 2021 amounted to EUR 31 million (period ended December 31, 2020: EUR 35 million)\n\n## Long-term Incentive Plan\n\nUnder the Signify Long-term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan), which is equity settled, eligible employees are granted both conditional shares and performance shares. Conditional shares have a threeyear cliff vesting period and will vest if a grantee is still employed with Signify at the vesting date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shares are conditionally granted annually.\n\nIn addition to shares awarded under the Signify LTI Plan, Signify may in individual cases, such as in the hiring process of members of (senior-) management, also grant restricted shares. Restricted shares have either three-year cliff vesting period or vest gradually over the vesting period of one, two or three years.\n\nUnder the terms of the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), employees are eligible to purchase a limited number of Signify shares at discounted prices through payroll withholdings.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nThe fair value of shares granted with the market performance condition of relative TSR is measured based on Monte Carlo simulation. The closing share price at grant date is adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, as participants are not compensated for Signify dividend payouts. Monte Carlo simulation takes into account market conditions expected to impact relative Total Shareholders' Return performance in relation to selected peers and the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\n## Assumptions used in Monte-Carlo simulation for valuation in %\n\n|                                 | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Risk-free interest rate         | (0.7) % |\n| Expected share price volatility | 39 %    |\n\nThe assumptions were used for these calculations only and do not necessarily represent an indication of Signify management's expectation of future developments for other purposes.\n\nHistoric volatility was measured over the same timeframe as the simulation period (weighted average 2.6 years).\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for TSR shares is not adjusted for actual performance.\n\nFCF, Sustainability, and ROCE related measurements are non-market performance conditions. Fair value of shares granted under FCF, Sustainability, and ROCE objective conditions equals the closing share price on the grant date, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for shares granted with a non-market performance condition is adjusted for actual performance.\n\nA summary of Signify performance shares movements and outstanding balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, is presented below.\n\n## Signify performance shares\n\n|                           | 2020 Weighted   | 2020 Weighted                   | 2021 Weighted   | 2021 Weighted                   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|\n| EUR-denominated           | Shares          | average  grant-date  fair value | Shares          | average  grant-date  fair value |\n| Balance as at January 1   | 1,899,991       | 27.12                           | 3,380,119       | 20.14                           |\n| Granted                   | 1,110,226       | 15.96                           | 579,559         | 50.20                           |\n| Vested                    | (672,036)       | 34.96                           | (954,446)       | 21.18                           |\n| Forfeited                 | (162,444)       | 30.34                           | (177,453)       | 22.88                           |\n| Performance adjustment    | 1,204,381       | 22.62                           | 257,992         | 17.85                           |\n| Balance as at December 31 | 3,380,119       | 20.14                           | 3,085,771       | 24.51                           |\n\nThe performance adjustment originates from updates in the number of shares which are expected to vest in relation to the mentioned non-market performance conditions.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, estimated unrecognized costs related to non-vested performance shares amounted to EUR 25 million. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.\n\n## Conditional shares\n\nFair value of conditional shares is determined by subtracting the present value of expected dividends from the closing share price on the grant date as participants are not compensated for Signify dividend payouts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by Signify using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will ultimately be realized by Signify upon maturity or disposal. The use of market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\nThe following hierarchy is applied to classify the financial assets and liabilities:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInstruments included in Level 1 are comprised primarily of listed Eurobonds classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Level 2\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, overthe-counter derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. Please refer to note 2, Significant accounting policies, for further details.\n\n## Level 3\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuating because of changes in the market interest rates. Financial instruments included in the debt position create an inherent interest rate risk. Failure to effectively hedge this risk could negatively impact financial results.\n\nSignify monitors interest rate coverage, short-term and long-term interest rate developments and has the flexibility to opt for different short-term interest periods for the variable debt instruments at roll-over dates and/or could enter into derivative financial instruments to fix\n\ninterest rates for a certain period of time. As of December 31, 2021, Signify had a ratio of fixedrate debt to total outstanding debt of approximately 75% (2020: 65%).\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted in January 2022 shows that if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by 1% from their level of December 31, 2021, with all other variables held constant, the annualized net interest expense would decrease by EUR 6 million. This impact was based on the outstanding net floating debt position as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Details on the COVID-19 impact are disclosed in note 1, Basis of preparation.\n\nLiquidity risk for Signify is monitored through the Treasury Risk Committee which tracks the development of the actual cash flow position and uses input from a number of sources in order to forecast the overall liquidity position.\n\nThe table below analyzes Signify's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant. Interest on Long-term debt is based on floating rate adjustments according to market expectations.\n\n|                                 |       | Payments due by period Between   | Payments due by period Between   | Payments due by period Between   |\n|---------------------------------|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                 | Total | Less than 1 year                 | 1 and 5  years                   | Over 5 years                     |\n| Debt, including bank overdrafts | 1,759 | 15                               | 1,150                            | 594                              |\n| Interest on debt                | 120   | 30                               | 84                               | 6                                |\n| Trade and other payables        | 2,334 | 2,334                            | -                                | -                                |\n| Lease liability                 | 249   | 62                               | 155                              | 32                               |\n| Derivative liabilities          | 45    | 44                               | 1                                | -                                |\n| Off-balance sheet commitments   | 125   | 30                               | 94                               | -                                |\n| Purchase obligations            | 102   | 59                               | 43                               | -                                |\n| Contractual cash obligations    | 4,733 | 2,574                            | 1,527                            | 632                              |\n| Revolving credit facility (RCF) | 500   | -                                | -                                | -                                |\n\nSignify invests surplus cash primarily in money market deposits with investment graded financial institutions, and with maturities up to three months, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet liabilities when due.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of December 31, 2021, Signify did not have any amounts drawn under this facility.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk is the risk that reported financial performance, or the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument, will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Signify operates in many countries and currencies and therefore currency fluctuations may inevitably impact its financial results. Signify is exposed to currency risk in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction exposures related to anticipated sales and purchases and on-balance-sheet receivables/payables resulting from such transactions.\n- \u00b7 Financing exposure arising from foreign currency intercompany and external debt and deposits.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of net income in foreign entities.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of foreign currency denominated equity invested in consolidated companies.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure to equity interests in non-functional-currency investments in associates and financial assets at fair value.\n\nIt is Signify's policy to reduce the volatility caused by foreign currency movements on its net earnings by hedging the anticipated net exposure of foreign currencies resulting from foreign currency sales and purchases. In general, net anticipated exposures are hedged during a period of 15 months in layers of 20% up to a hedge ratio of 80%, using derivatives.\n\nSignify's policy requires significant committed foreign currency exposures to be fully hedged, generally using forwards. However, not every foreign currency can or shall be hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost preventing Signify from effectively and/or efficiently hedging its currency exposures. As a result, hedging activities cannot and will not eliminate all currency risks for anticipated and committed transaction exposures.\n\nThe following table outlines the estimated nominal value in millions of EUR for transaction exposures and related hedges for Signify's most significant currency exposures:\n\n|                           | Receivables / Sales   | Receivables / Sales   | Payables / Purchases   | Payables / Purchases   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                           | Exposure              | Hedges                | Exposure               | Hedges                 |\n| Balance as at December 31 |                       |                       |                        |                        |\n| Exposure currency         |                       |                       |                        |                        |\n| CNY                       | 12                    | (12)                  | (1,117)                | 784                    |\n| USD                       | 1,251                 | (837)                 | (177)                  | 175                    |\n| GBP                       | 123                   | (78)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| EUR  1                    | 59                    | (59)                  | (12)                   | 12                     |\n| CAD                       | 110                   | (73)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| SEK                       | 74                    | (44)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| CHF                       | 68                    | (42)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| AUD                       | 52                    | (35)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| NOK                       | 53                    | (32)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| SGD                       | 37                    | (23)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| NZD                       | 24                    | (16)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| RON                       | 25                    | (16)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| CZK                       | 24                    | (15)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| PLN                       | 67                    | (67)                  | (133)                  | 95                     |\n| Others                    | 46                    | (46)                  | (19)                   | 19                     |\n| Total 2021                | 2,024                 | (1,394)               | (1,458)                | 1,085                  |\n| Total 2020                | 1,866                 | (1,177)               | (1,471)                | 920                    |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, a loss of EUR 3 million was deferred in equity as a result of these hedges (2020: gain of EUR 22 million). The result deferred in equity will be released to earnings mostly during 2022 at the time when the related hedged transaction affects the Consolidated statement of income. During 2021, EUR nil million (2020: EUR nil million) was recorded within cost of goods sold in the Consolidated statement of income as a result of ineffectiveness on certain anticipated cash flow hedges.\n\nThe total net fair value of hedges related to transaction exposure as of December 31, 2021, was an unrealized asset of EUR 2 million (2020: asset EUR 23 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to an increase of EUR 29 million in the value of the derivatives. This increase includes a gain of EUR 4 million that would impact the income statement, which would largely offset the opposite revaluation effect on the underlying accounts receivable and payable, and the remaining gain of\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "EUR 25 million would be recognized in equity to the extent that the cash flow hedges were effective.\n\nForeign exchange exposure also arises from intercompany loans and deposits. Where Signify enters into such arrangements the financing is generally provided in the functional currency of the subsidiary. The currency of Signify's external funding and liquid assets is matched with the required financing of subsidiaries either directly through external foreign currency loans and deposits or synthetically by using foreign exchange derivatives. In certain cases, where Signify subsidiaries may also have external foreign currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also hedged using foreign exchange derivatives. The fair value of these hedges as of December 31, 2021 was an unrealized asset of EUR 8 million (2020: asset of EUR 2 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to a decrease of EUR 21 million in the value of the derivatives.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Signify continued to hedge part of its investment in one of its foreign subsidiaries which includes Cooper Lighting by entering into foreign currency forward contracts of nominal amount of USD 150 million. This hedge mitigates foreign currency translation risk arising from the net assets of the subsidiary. This hedge was fully effective, as such there was no ineffectiveness recognized in profit and loss in 2021. As at 31 December 2021, the market value of these forward contracts was an asset of EUR 4 million. A 10% increase in the value of the EUR against USD would lead to an increase of EUR 12 million in the fair value of derivatives that end up in the Currency translation differences within Equity.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in commodity prices.\n\nSignify is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals and energy. Signify could hedge certain commodity price risks using derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2021, Signify had EUR 17 million of commodity derivatives recognized in the Statement of financial position (2020: EUR nil million).\n\nChange of the commodity price by 10% will lead to the commodity derivatives value change of EUR 7 million (2020: EUR 5 million).\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date, if counterparties failed completely to perform their payment obligations as contracted. Credit risk is present within Signify trade and other receivables and contract assets. To have better insights into the credit exposures, Signify performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its customers and adjusts credit limits when appropriate. In instances where the\n\ncreditworthiness of a customer is determined not to be sufficient to grant the credit limit required, there are a number of mitigation tools that can be utilized to close the gap, including reducing payment terms, cash on delivery, prepayments and pledges on assets.\n\nSignify invests available cash and cash equivalents and enters into financial derivative instruments with various financial institutions and is exposed to credit risk with these counterparties. Signify does not enter into any financial derivative instruments to protect against default by financial institutions.\n\nWhere possible, Signify requires all financial institutions to complete legally enforceable netting agreements under an International Swap Dealers Association master agreement or otherwise prior to trading, and whenever possible, to have a solid credit rating from generally accepted rating agencies. Signify also regularly monitors the development of the credit risk of its financial counterparties.\n\nSignify minimizes this risk by limiting the deposits made with any single bank and by making deposits, the majority of which is with banks that have strong credit ratings.\n\nMaximum credit risk exposure for Signify equals carrying amounts of all financial assets recognized in the Statement of financial position plus off-balance sheet guarantees provided.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk is the risk that political, legal, or economic developments in a single country could adversely impact our performance. The country risk per country is defined as the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and associated companies in country cross-border transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts receivable from third parties and intercompany accounts receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Signify had country risk exposure of EUR 2.6 billion in the United States, EUR 1.1 billion in the Netherlands, EUR 566 million in China including Hong Kong and EUR 508 million in Belgium. Countries where the risk exceeds EUR 200 million but was less than EUR 500 million are Poland (EUR 491 million) and Saudi Arabia (EUR 206 million). Countries where the risk exceeded EUR 50 million but was less than EUR 200 million are Spain, Mexico, France, Canada, India, Australia and the United Kingdom. The degree of risk of a country is taken into account when new investments are considered. Signify does not, however, use financial derivative instruments to hedge country risk, except for the net investment hedge as described in the currency risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is embedded in our purpose and integral to our strategy and the way we do business. And we believe we have an important role to play in helping achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They have been our strategic compass in creating our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program and commitments. We report our contribution to six SDGs: 3 - Good health and well-being; 7 Affordable and clean energy; 8 - Decent work and economic growth; 11 - Sustainable cities and communities; 12 - Responsible consumption and production; and 13 - Climate action. Through our activities, we contribute to the achievement of these SDGs.\n\nWe create value within the financial, environmental and social domains, and we have made our approach towards long-term value creation transparent by preparing this Annual Report with key elements of the Value Reporting Foundation's Integrated Reporting framework and reporting in accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards.\n\nSignify is subject to E.U. Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (so called EU Taxonomy) and disclosures can be found in section 16.5 of this chapter.\n\nAt the core of our reporting approach is the value creation model. This model shows how our business activities depend on various financial, environmental, and social resources that are converted to outputs. Our activities and their outputs lead to outcomes in terms of the impact made on our stakeholders and society at large. Since 2017, Signify communicates its impacts in monetary terms, enabling more effective and efficient decision making and giving a holistic view on our most prominent risks and opportunities. It also provides further transparency to our stakeholders on company performance. By publishing the results of our analysis and being transparent on the methodology, we strive to contribute to developing a global standard for impact analysis.\n\nOur external auditor Ernst & Young Accountants LLP (EY) has provided reasonable (highest level) assurance on our sustainability performance and sustainability statements in this Annual Report. To read the combined assurance statement, including detailed scope of assurance, please refer to chapter 17, Combined independent auditor's report, of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## 16.1.1 D efinition of Signify's strategic focus: our\n\n## materiality assessment\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur materiality assessment is the first step towards defining our strategy. By identifying future trends and understanding stakeholders' perspectives at a global and local level, we are better able to manage the risks and opportunities that could impact our ability to create value in the long term.\n\nWe define materiality along two axes. The vertical axis captures the importance of each topic for external and internal stakeholders. The horizontal axis captures both our company's significant impacts on the economy, the environment, and society, and the impact of externalities on our business. Assessing both aspects enables us to prioritize and focus on the most relevant issues in terms of our efforts as well as reporting progress in this Annual Report. Our materiality assessment was conducted using the GRI Standards' principles for defining report content while integrating the concept of double materiality.\n\nAs a first step in our materiality assessment, we use different sources of information to identify possible material topics. This includes external sources (media and trends analysis, on-going stakeholder engagement insights) as well as internal input. For the first time in 2021, we integrated the top risks and opportunities identified during Signify's annual risk workshop. We translated top risks into material topics to offer a complete overview of our financial and non-financial risks and\n\nopportunities and improve the link between sustainability, risk management, and strategy. By the end of this first phase, we can list all material topics for Signify (17 topics in 2021). To prioritize these topics, Signify organizes dedicated stakeholder engagement activities. In 2021, this consisted of an online survey reaching out to 550 internal and external stakeholders (response rate of 22%) and internal strategic discussions. At the end of this process, we are able to identify the most material topics Signify should be reported on.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\n## On-going discussions\n\nWe engage with stakeholders considered most relevant to our company including customers, employees, suppliers, investors and analysts, municipalities and governments, and civil society organizations. These stakeholders are most likely to be impacted by our activities and have the most influence on achieving our commitments. Capturing\n\nperspectives from multiple stakeholder groups enables us to gain broader insights into value creation and contributes to the definition of our future strategy and plans.\n\nIn 2021, part of Signify's strategic stakeholder engagements focused on the ambition levels, interrelations and alignment of global and regional 2030 and 2050 climate goals with the economic recovery programs of the world's major economies.

During each of these conferences, we issued a call for action highlighting the multiple benefits of switching to connected LED lighting and the increase of infrastructure renovation rates to 3% per year.\n\nThroughout the year, we were deeply involved in the European Green Deal and Recovery process, with all of our markets messaging and exploring support and opportunities in the National Recovery & Resilience Plans (NRRP's). We have launched a dedicated 'Green Switch' program, while mainly through our partnerships with the Corporate Leaders Group Europe, the European Alliance to Save Energy and the World Economic Forum, we were involved in the concurrent policy developments that led to the creation of the 'Fit for 55' package. The goal of this initiative is for the EU to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Through NEMA and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, we contributed to the 'Build Back Better' economic recovery planning in the USA leading to the encouraging approval of the American Infrastructure and Jobs Act in November 2021.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to hold memberships and be active in many organizations, including the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), and The Climate Group.\n\n## Materiality assessment engagement\n\nFor the dedicated stakeholder engagement related to our 2021 materiality assessment, we defined stakeholder representatives from each of the six identified groups: customers, employees, investors and analysts, suppliers, governments and municipalities and civil society organizations. Representatives have been selected based on expertise, constituency and geography. The broad range of stakeholders minimizes bias and creates a diverse insight.\n\nStakeholders' expectations and inputs are captured at all phases of our materiality assessment. Through different engagement channels, we inform our stakeholders about our activities, the measures taken and the results.\n\n## 2021 materiality assessment: conclusions\n\nIn 2021, as an outcome of the assessment, we confirm that Climate action and Human rights are our two most material topics. Business ethics and Safety at work remain very important and Signify has robust processes in place. Social impact of light, Circular economy, Digitalization, and Geopolitical instability are important for Signify and are positioned on the right-hand side of the matrix. Biodiversity and Water are both in the lower quadrant of this matrix and are our two least material topics. The result of the materiality assessment has been reviewed by the Leadership Team and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe details of our 2021 materiality assessment, as well as the definition of each material topic can be found in the Sustainability Supplements to the Annual\n\nReport, available on our Sustainability downloads webpage: https:// www.signify.com/global/sustainability/ downloads.\n\nMateriality matrix\n\n<!-- image -->",

Progress is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Board of Management and the Leadership Team. During these meetings, progress on strategic programs is reviewed and corrective actions are taken when necessary.\n\nProgress is also reviewed with the Supervisory Board on an annual basis. In addition, the results of our sustainability programs are communicated on a quarterly basis to Signify employees and on our website to external stakeholders.\n\nSustainability programs are embedded in the Signify organization and ways of working.

We also used additional company disclosures. An overview of the information on data definitions, measurements and any uncertainties inherent to measurements can be found in the Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report, available on our Sustainability downloads webpage: https:// www.signify.com/global/sustainability/ downloads. These supplements also include more information on our 2021 materiality assessment, a GRI Content Index, our Task\n\nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting and to the E.U. Directive on non-financial information. In 2021, Signify re-committed to the United Nations Global Compact to advance 10 universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anticorruption efforts. This report also serves as our annual Communication on Progress (COP) towards abiding by these principles.\n\nNew Signify ventures and acquisitions are included in environmental and social disclosures to the extent that the integration process of these ventures has been finalized. The normative integration period is two years. Divestitures completed before December 31 of the book-year are excluded from environmental and social reporting. For our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 doubling commitments, we use best estimates for 2019 as a base, including for Cooper Lighting and Klite.

Our sustainable products and systems must demonstrate proven measurable benefits in one or more of the eight sustainable focal areas (SFAs) compared to the relevant, regularly updated benchmark.\n\nWe have five Better World SFAs:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy & solar - increasing energy efficiency of products, systems and services, and solar systems and solutions\n- \u00b7 Circularity - optimally preserving value and avoiding waste via serviceable luminaires, circular components, intelligent assets, and circular services\n- \u00b7 Packaging - reducing packaging weight and volume, increasing recycled content in packaging of professional products and eliminating the use of plastics in packaging of consumer products\n- \u00b7 Substances - eliminating harmful substances\n- \u00b7 Weight & materials - reducing product weight, selecting recycled and/or renewable materials, and increasing commonalities\n\nAnd three Brighter Lives SFAs:\n\n- \u00b7 Safety & security - providing light that improves the safety of people in traffic,\n\ncities and houses and increases protection against cybercrime\n\n- \u00b7 Health & well-being - supporting health, well-being, and performance of humans through unlocking the visual, biological, and emotional benefits of light\n- \u00b7 Food availability - providing light that enables the production of more and better-quality food, while optimizing the use of land, water and energy and avoiding pesticides\n\nOur sustainable innovations continue to transform the lighting industry. In 2021, we invested EUR 266 million in sustainable innovation which represents 92.9% of Signify R&D expenses (85.1% in 2020).\n\nWe believe that sustainable innovation will help create a more future-proof and purposeful portfolio of products, systems and services.\n\n## 4VPUMJOMNMFAJOOPRMUJPOAJOANJMMJPOP PGA&63\n\n\"PAMAglyph<c=6,font=/AAAVPT+SignifyRaisonne-DemiBold>APGA3glyph<c=7,font=/AAAVPT+SignifyRaisonne-DemiBold>GAPQFOU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 16.3 Brighter Lives\n\nWith the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals as our strategic compass, in 2020 we launched our new Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program with even more ambitious goals.

Creating a great place to work, where people belong, have an impact, and take pride in the company we build together, remains at the heart of our people vision. Our people priorities for 2021 were focused on creating a more diverse workforce and inclusive, equitable\n\nwork environment, accelerating the reskilling of our workforce for Digital excellence, strengthening our Performance culture, and ensuring our competitiveness through creating a leaner corporate center.\n\nIn July 2021, as part of our DE&I journey, we signed the UN Women's Empowerment Principles, a global initiative to promote and strengthen women in companies. We focused on attracting and hiring new, diverse talent. We continued to strengthen our learning culture with a dedication to develop all our employees. We also have increased our efforts to become a truly digital company by reshaping our digital organization while advancing on our strategic initiatives to digitize our customer interfaces, internal processes and products & services. Our people and their digital capabilities are essential enablers, which we have invested in to deliver on our digital ambition.\n\nGiven the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lighting industry, we have taken a proactive approach to adjust our cost base and improve our competitiveness through delayering our commercial organization and creating a leaner corporate center.\n\nI am proud to be part of this fantastic team; together we have shown that also in difficult times our values guide us to create brighter lives and a better world.\"",

The remaining 9% worked in corporate functions. In line with the ongoing external workforce changes and digital transformation, we expect that the nature of the current workforce will continue to evolve.\n\nIn 2021, the total employee turnover was 54% (2020: 32%), with the vast majority related to turnover in factory and distribution staff in Mexico. The increase in turnover year-onyear was driven by stronger seasonal adjustments in production and labor volumes due to the logistical challenges this year, and\n\nis also reflecting the increasing labor market competitiveness we faced in 2021.

We believe that we will maintain our position as the market leader in lighting by being a talent-builder, developing and growing people from within. We want our employees to have a challenging and rewarding work experience. One where they can grow and make an impact, where they gain new experiences and develop themselves.\n\nOur approach to talent is to continuously build and develop employees' functional and leadership skills, whilst attracting new, diverse talent where critical capabilities are needed to strengthen our talent pool and achieve our strategic objectives.\n\nIn 2021, we welcomed 14,135 external talents to help bring our business vision to life, most of whom were employed in manufacturing functions. In line with our people philosophy to promote talent from within the organization, 85% of our senior management and leadership roles were filled internally\n\n## A robust global employer brand\n\nIn 2021, we continued to build on our refreshed Employer Value Proposition (EVP): Shine Brighter at Signify - together we unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world. The sustainability proposition is aligned with our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability commitments, focusing more on continuous learning as well as DE&I.\n\nIn 2021, notable achievements include various certifications and awards in many countries, for example: Certification as Top Employer in the Netherlands, China, Brazil (Top Employer\u00ae Institute), Great Place to work (The Great Place to Work\u00ae Institute) in Singapore and India where we were also recognized as one of India's 100 Best Workplaces for Women and we made it to Mogul's list of Top 100 workplaces with the best D&I initiatives.\n\nWe directed our recruitment marketing campaigns on the most critical segments, to drive our transformation and growth and build talent pipelines. In 2021, we focused on reaching diverse technology, marketing, and sales candidates with relevant messaging customized per region and reflecting our EVP.\n\nAs part of our global talent acquisition strategy, we continue to attract talent from proven high-quality sources. In 2021, the main sources of hire were:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal - Over the last few years we have filled approximately 30% of our vacancies internally.\n- \u00b7 Employee referral - 24% of total external hires came from employee referrals.\n- \u00b7 Sourcing - Our recruiters focus on proactively building talent pipelines and identifying talent, supported by recruitment marketing campaigns to increase awareness and drive conversion for-hard-to-fill roles.\n- \u00b7 Signify careers website - Via our content strategy on social media \"Humanizing our employer brand\", employees shared why Signify is a great place to work, in alignment with our values and EVP and enabled us to outperform competition. We were nominated by LinkedIn as a finalist at the 2021 LinkedIn Best Employer Brand Award in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Signify global career website can be found at www.careers.signify.com.\n\n## Employee engagement & well-being\n\nEmployee engagement and well-being are key to our competitive performance and integral to our people vision: creating a workplace where people belong, have impact and take pride in the company we build together. Engaged employees are emotionally committed to our company. They help us to meet our business goals and sustainability commitments, whilst contributing to a dynamic, high-performance workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the effects of lockdowns on mental health and well-being became clear. A stronger focus was brought in the learner domain for these essential topics. We also established a number of grassroots initiatives to create awareness on these topics:\n\n- \u00b7 Meet2Grow sessions, organized by the learning team, with topics focused on resilience, emotional intelligence, and stress management.\n- \u00b7 Healthy Breaks sessions, as short virtual energizing moments to connect colleagues on topics such as music and food.\n- \u00b7 Virtual Coffee corners around the globe, as informal meetings for our leaders and employees to stay connected while working from home.\n\nBecause sustainability is central to our company strategy, we have engaged our employees on the topic of sustainability since 2019. We do this with quarterly employee engagement themes and challenges that help employees reflect on and connect personal values with Signify's business practices.\n\nThe Signify Team Survey poses questions in line with our company purpose and values, and it has proven to be a positive driver of employee engagement to increase team effectiveness. As a result, we have continued to run the Team survey every quarter to monitor employee engagement and take corrective actions when needed.\n\nThrough the Signify Team Survey, in 2021 91% of our employees said that we truly put our Customer First (2020: 88%); 87% of our employees acknowledged that we are Greater Together (2020: 89%); 85% of our employees felt that we are considered a\n\nGame Changer (2020: 90%) and 87% of our employees agreed that we have Passion for Results (2020: 81%). We noted that we need to continue improving in the areas of effectiveness and recognition. Initiatives to address our improvement points are driven at a team level via our Team dialogues, and we continue to track progress on these questions during our Quarterly Performance Reviews.\n\nTo measure employee satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology is used as part of our Team survey. Employees are asked to rank how likely it is that they would recommend our company as a great place to work. In 2021, the Team survey had an average employee response rate of 84%, the highest level since we began running the survey (2020: 83%). At the end of 2021, we recorded an NPS score of 32 (Q4) and an average annual NPS score of 30 across the Signify population (2020: 25). Despite all the challenges we faced in 2021, our employee engagement score remained high and we continue to prioritize employee health and safety. Our eNPS score is in the top 25% of companies making up the ETS eNPS benchmark.\n\n## Learning & development\n\nLearning continued to be a competitive advantage at Signify and plays an important role in attracting and retaining talent. Our personalized learning environments flourished as remote working became the new standard for many colleagues and customers around the globe. Empowering our employees and customers to upskill anytime, anywhere was a key focus in 2021.\n\nA wide range of learning offerings supported the new challenges that our employees and customers had to overcome: How to stay connected with colleagues and customers? How to prepare for the (hybrid) future, where customer experiences are entirely digital and supported by technology?\n\nPeople connected virtually on our knowledge-exchange platforms to consume or to share their knowledge with colleagues and customers. The learning experience platform Learning@Signify reached an active learner rate of 69% in Q4 2021.  Additionally, we successfully launched a new customer learning platform  and the Lighting Academy on LinkedIn reached over 12,000 followers.\n\nIn 2021, the average number of hours spent on training and development per FTE was 34 hours. Based on our value creation methodology, Signify has created EUR 4.03 million in value for our society through its employees' learning and development programs.\n\n## Live virtual connections as a substitute for formal classrooms\n\nAs a result of travel restrictions, people actively came together in virtual classrooms to practice new skill sets and listen to industry experts. In 2021, offering more online learning possibilities contributed to reduce emissions from air travel in 2021.\n\nIn our S-Talks training, over 6,000 customers and employees came together to be upskilled on System knowledge. During the year, we reached the 10,000 certificates milestone for the Let's Get Systemized program, launched in 2019. For example, the Dynalite training that used to be done face-to-face was wholly\n\nmigrated to a Live Virtual Classroom that was upskilled via innovative virtual assessments and newly designed knowledge tests.\n\nAnother essential capability building training focused on Product Security, where Signify was awarded the IEC62443-4-1 security certification for its connected lighting development process by DEKRA. Product Management and Service Bootcamps were organized to grow the value-creation and selling capability.\n\n## Upskill for greater customer impact\n\nIn 2021, an innovative sales training program was developed and deployed for customerfacing roles in the organization. The Impact program focuses on how to stay relevant for our customers in today's reality, where everything is available online. It introduces a consultative and innovative approach to selling, with a greater emphasis on relationship building and trust. The program covers a range of fundamental skills, such as how to optimize the use of social media to connect more widely in the customer organization, how to build trust in the new virtual reality, and how to grow opportunities for sustainable growth. In total, 28 global training cohorts got involved in this 24-week training program in 2021.\n\n## Upskill for digitalization\n\nHow do we lead the digital transition and transform our business models for the future? In 2021, we continued to invest in digital reskilling designed around critical digital competencies such as: Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Data & Analytics (AI / Machine Learning / Data Analytics), Cloud Computing, Information & Cyber security, AGILE (SAFe & SCRUM),\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to self-paced learning modules, the journey had several interactive learning experiences covering:\n\n- \u00b7 Master classes: Orchestrated by our Subject Matter Experts, with drop-in clinic dialogues\n- \u00b7 Exploration of Outside-In dialogues: Sharing best practices with external executives and/or our internal teams in fire-chats\n- \u00b7 Lunch and learn sessions: Peer dialogues to reflect and exchange ideas\n\n## Leadership development\n\nLinked to the people pillar of our 5 Frontiers strategy - be a great place to work - we continued to ensure that our leadership development experiences are aligned to this and to our talent philosophy. In 2021, given the necessity to adjust to the travel limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to deliver on-site and virtual leadership programs in various parts of the world.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced the new iEDGE program to strengthen the leadership skills of our new people leaders. This ensured that our early talents and people leaders continued to get support in their roles for\n\nSignify to build a pipeline of future-ready leaders who can further take the company down paths of excellence and sustainable growth. We completed 2 EDGE I leadership programs and 3 iEDGE programs in 2021.\n\nAs we move into 2022, we will continue to improve the leadership offerings ensuring our leaders are equipped to lead, develop and inspire our people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 16.3.2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D iversity, equity & inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Signify, we believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment are essential to a thriving innovative business and long-term value creation. We are an equal opportunity employer committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. This means we celebrate and foster an environment in which all ideas, perspectives, experiences and styles are highly valued and where all individuals are treated fairly with equal access to opportunities and resources. Diverse representation in our workforce is critical for our long-term success as a company. It enables us to understand, connect and communicate with our customers, end-users and stakeholders while helping us to attract and retain people who want to be part of our purpose to create brighter lives and a better world. Our diversity, equity and inclusion\n\n(DE&I) strategy reinforces our Greater Together value, enabling us to make better decisions, boost innovation, create growth, and strengthen our culture.\n\nIn 2021, we signed the United Nations (UN) Women Empowerment Principles, which underpins our commitment to double the percentage of women in leadership in our business to 34% by the end of 2025, and is another step towards ensuring equal opportunities, fairness, and impartiality for all. We also participated in the UN Global Compact Target Gender Equality Program, which helps us assess our practices from an equity and inclusion perspective and learn from peers to deepen implementation of Women Empowerment Principles.\n\nWe continued to reinforce our existing '2+1' approach i.e., global focus on two specific diversity dimensions of gender and generation with space for markets, divisions and functions to locally implement important and relevant initiatives. Some recent examples include DE&I Speaker Series and Courageous Conversations in the US, which fostered understanding on key concepts of DE&I. We also facilitated gender inclusion workshops in Market India to tackle unconscious biases based on gender and develop more inclusive leadership. Market France conducted a webinar session on disability inclusion to raise further awareness and understanding. Market UK&I facilitated a session to show their support and connection with the LGBTQ+ community. Market Benelux organized a session on mental well-being to support mental health inclusivity.\n\nIn 2021, our DE&I champions' network grew to around 160 members, who continue to drive actions locally and share best practices. Our DE&I Board, created in 2019, continued to structure and advance our strategy and roadmap. In 2021, we designed and deployed a new e-learning program on DE&I awareness to build a common language and understanding across the organization. At the end of the year, the global completion rate was 91%.\n\nGlobally, we recognize the need for a more diverse representation in the areas of gender and age, and we continually monitor related data to support our aim of reaching greater diversity representation in our organization. Over the past three years we have maintained the representation from different generations in our workforce. We plan to further improve our generational diversity in the future by increasing the inflow of earlycareer talents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

From a generational perspective, 18% of employees were 30 years old or under (2020: 15%). We have the ambition to attract and retain more early-career talents to build a sustainable talent pipeline.

Signify establishes formal pay policies and practices that govern hiring, benefit entitlements, annual merit, and promotional guidelines to ensure equity. Furthermore, Signify performs regular reviews which are designed to ensure compliance with our policy of equal pay for equal work and all local legal requirements in the countries in which we operate. Our regular review process includes a comprehensive statistical analysis of pay to employees across the world. Any statisticallysignificant variance within any employee group is promptly addressed.\n\n100\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 16.3.3 Human rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our approach\n\nRespecting human rights is a central foundation of the way we work.

Dedicated communication campaigns urged everyone to speak-up and report concerns of possible violations. In those campaigns, the availability of our Ethics hotline was also highlighted.

In 2021, we identified in the sites of our newly-acquired operations some practices that are not yet aligned with our policy. We have put a plan in place to align these practices with our policy.\n\n## Living wages\n\nRecognition and rewards have been identified as an important engagement driver for our employees and direct suppliers. By ensuring good working conditions, Signify not only aims to provide a fair, safe, and respectful work environment, but also an inspiring place to work and grow. Fair remuneration is considered a precondition for our employees\n\nto flourish. Signify provides total minimum requirements and is in line with the industry practices in the markets in which we operate. In addition, we are committed to providing our employees with a living wage, ensuring that their everyday needs are met. The guiding principles of our pay policy include providing competitive remuneration relative to all labor markets, ensuring equity, and providing a living wage to our employees.\n\nAs such, to ensure compliance against our guiding principles, Signify launched its Living Wages program in 2017. Every two years, Signify performs an analysis of salaries and benefits for employees globally with respect to a living wage, covering the necessary living costs. We compare our wages to the WageIndicator Foundation database.\n\nIn 2021, Signify enhanced its analysis by looking at 43 different regions around the world rather than on an overall country basis for a select number of countries, as was done in previous years. The results show that company standards exceed the living wage standards in all regions examined except two. We will create a plan to address this delta for each of the two regions in 2022.\n\nFair compensation in terms of wages, overtime and benefits for our suppliers' employees in risk countries is part of our sustainable supply chain program. Through our active engagement, 98% of our risk suppliers met our requirements. In 2020, we started to collect relevant data among our suppliers, and we continued to do this in 2021.",

Responsible procurement practices and management of our supply chain require a structured and innovative approach due to the wide variety of stakeholders.\n\nSignify has developed programs over the years to prevent human rights violations in its supply chain. These programs cover the assessment and development of supplier sustainability performance (audits and training) and responsible minerals sourcing. As part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we are strengthening our commitment towards a more sustainable supply chain by increasing our supplier sustainability performance rate annual target to 95% until the end of 2025.\n\nThrough our efforts, we foster decent work and economic growth by improving the safety & well-being of suppliers and directly contribute to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth,\n\n## Supplier sustainability performance\n\nThe core of our supplier sustainability performance program is the Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD). This declaration forms an integral part of our supplier contracts and can be found on our website: https://www.signify.com/global/ contact/suppliers/sustainability/ourprograms/supplier-sustainabilitymanagement.\n\nThe SSD is derived from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and sets out the standards and behaviors we require from our suppliers and their suppliers. It covers labor, health & safety, environment, ethics and management systems. We monitor supplier compliance with the SSD through a system of regular audits. In the RBA Code of Conduct and in our SSD, special attention is given to the prevention of human slavery as referred to in the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act Disclosures and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The formal statement on these legislations can be found on our website.\n\nOur audit program consists of full audits performed in a three-year cycle by an independent audit firm for selected suppliers in risk countries. In 2021, we continued the integration of our new acquisitions' suppliers in the program and we aim to finalize it in 2022.\n\nIf non-conformances are identified, we require the supplier to develop and execute a corrective action plan. We support our suppliers to correct the non-conformances, for instance by providing training or sharing best practices. We monitor the execution of the corrective action plans until the supplier is compliant with our requirements. In case of delays, the supplier is classified as noncompliant in our Tritium program and we apply a stratified approach for consequence management. Tritium is a program that helps us develop a strong supply chain with bestin-class suppliers and is based on selection and rewards criteria against our strategic priorities. We work with each supplier to resolve non-conformances within ninety days, where possible.\n\nThe table below shows the summary of our 2021 audit program.\n\n## Summary of 2021 audit program (three-year cycle, third-party audit)\n\n|                                   | Greater  China   | Rest of  the World   | Americas   |   Europe | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|----------|---------|\n| Total no. of risk suppliers       | 192              | 42                   | 31         |        0 | 265     |\n| Total no. of audits               | 69               | 9                    | 14         |        0 | 92      |\n| Initial audits                    | 26               | 5                    | 8          |        0 | 39      |\n| Continued conformance audits      | 43               | 4                    | 6          |        0 | 53      |\n| Workers employed at sites audited | 28,756           | 6,317                | 4,256      |        0 | 39,329  |\n\nIn 2021 we added 25 new suppliers to our program.\n\n## Total new suppliers in 2021 audit program\n\n|                            |   Greater  China |   Rest of  the world |   Americas |   Europe |   Total |\n|----------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|----------|---------|\n| New suppliers (onboarding) |               17 |                    3 |          4 |        1 |      25 |\n\nThe supplier sustainability performance rate represents the percentage of risk suppliers that have an audit score of at least 90 out of 100 points. Despite COVID-19, we were able to fully execute our program at suppliers' facilities with limited need for remote auditing. In 2021, while we continued integrating our new acquisitions' suppliers, we surpassed our target of 95% by achieving a supplier sustainability performance rate of 98% (2020: 99%).",

        "page_content": "## Supplier training and developments\n\nSince 2017, we have put in place on-site trainings for our suppliers. These trainings are tailored towards the non-conformances that were found during the audit. By doing so, we train supplier staff on the topics that are most important for them to improve on. In 2021, we performed on-site trainings at 67 supplier sites, with a total of 351 attendees.\n\nWe also organize training sessions on the RBA Code of Conduct and SSD. To address critical and emerging issues, we provide in-depth capability building programs for our suppliers on specific topics. In 2021, we focused these extra trainings on carbon emissions and reduction activities, related to the CDP Supply Chain program, and initiated a new Science-Based Targets (SBTs) program to help our suppliers implement SBTs and drive greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in our supply chain.\n\nIn 2021, we organized five training sessions which were attended by 198 suppliers, with a total of 381 attendees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reducing water and air pollution levels in China\n\nTo contribute to the reduction of the environmental pollution in China, Signify worked with the Chinese Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE), leveraging their work to engage with our suppliers. For instance, to help suppliers better understand environmental issues, we organized three IPE training sessions in 2021 as a part of our overall RBA training program.  Periodically, IPE publishes a list of Chinese factories associated with concerning environmental pollution levels. Signify engages with any suppliers on the IPE list to resolve environmental nonconformances. From 2015 to the end of 2021, there were 57 direct suppliers flagged on the IPE's list. In 2021, this number was reduced to 10 (2020: 9), and 47 suppliers have taken action to remediate and their violation records were removed from the IPE website. Signify also requested direct suppliers to engage their own direct suppliers that appear on the IPE's list to resolve nonconformances.\n\n## Responsible mineral sourcing\n\nOur commitment to sustainable development extends to issues further down the supply chain, to prevent human rights abuses and financing of conflicts in the extractive sector. Global supply chains in the lighting industry are long and complex, typically with more than seven tiers between the finished product and the source of raw materials used for manufacturing. However, we believe that through strong multi-stakeholder partnerships we can make a difference.\n\nAs part of the Signify Conflict Minerals program, we implement measures in our supply chain to ensure that our products are not directly or indirectly funding atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We support and follow the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and HighRisk Areas. The full description of our due diligence process and Signify's position on Conflict Minerals are available on our website: https://www.signify.com/global/contact/ suppliers/sustainability/our-programs/ conflict-minerals .\n\nSince 2016, we are a member of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), a public-private partnership initiative. The EPRM provides a platform for cooperation between European governments, companies and civil society to address the issues occurring in the mining of minerals and to enable responsible sourcing from high risk and conflict regions.\n\nWe are also an active member of the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) which runs the audit program to verify the smelters'\n\nconflict-free status and to identify sources of 3TG and cobalt in our supply chain. We use the tools and programs developed by the RMI, especially the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) and the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). Each year, we invite our main suppliers, based on purchasing spend and metal usage, to fill in the latest version of the CMRT and/or CRT. We carefully review the information received via the CMRT and CRT from each supplier against our requirements and we check our upstream smelters against the RMI smelters list. The smelters identified through this process are included in the Signify smelter list published in our Signify Conflict Minerals Declaration (see link above).\n\nIn 2021, we identified 324 3TG smelters, of which 83% are conformant or in the compliance process with RMI audits, 15% are not yet included in the process and 2% are non-conformant (8 cases). We also identified 7 smelters for cobalt, of which one is nonconformant. Follow-up actions are planned with the involved suppliers for 2022. At the end 2021, the suppliers of Cooper Lighting and Kite were not yet fully integrated in this program.\n\nMore can be found on our website: https:// www.signify.com/global/contact/suppliers/ sustainability/our-programs/responsibleminerals.\n\nThe results of the Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI) for conflict minerals can be found in the table below. The information for the RCOI is provided by RMI.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To enhance transparency in the cobalt supply chain, in 2018 we co-founded the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA) with Fairphone, Huayou and Impact Facility. This multistakeholder action platform offers actors across the cobalt supply chain a precompetitive environment for collaboration to help strengthen and professionalize DRC's artisanal cobalt mining sector and contribute to local economic development at large. The 2021 focus was on preparing for a solar project that will deliver clean-technologybased lighting systems to schools, communal spaces and institutions, empowering communities to be safer, more active, and economically productive after sunset.

We commit to provide a safe working environment for our employees and we contribute to the achievement of SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth,\n\nThe total recordable cases (TRC) rate is the central lagging indicator through which we measure our overall safety performance.\n\nTargets for this indicator are set and managed at a company-wide level, and for the individual divisions and manufacturing sites and distribution centers.\n\nAs part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program, we will continue to strengthen our programs to maintain a safe and healthy workplace. We strengthened our commitment with a TRC target of 0.30 by the end of 2025, with the ambition for all individual sites to reach it.\n\nIn 2021, we strengthened employee behaviors in non-routine situations. With the STAR (Stop-Think-Act-Reflect) campaign and risk awareness trainings, we have enforced engagement and accountability of employees to stop (Andon) and speak-up when facing non-standard or hazardous situations at work. STAR was the theme of our Safety Week 2021.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to improve equipment safety, warehousing safety, behavioral safety and drive progress for leading indicators related to first aid cases, near-misses, unsafe conditions and at-risk behaviors. Our injury prevention framework, launched in 2015, continued its integration into the operational Lean framework and Signify management system. All our industrial sites have now adopted the key elements of this framework and dedicated integration programs are executed for our recently acquired sites of Cooper Lighting and Klite. In 2021, we continued our efforts to further reduce injury and illness rates by improving daily standards to prevent injuries. We increased our injury prevention requirements in the upgrades of Signify's Lean program.\n\nAt the end of 2021, we recorded 58 TRC cases in 2021 (2020: 52) and we had no fatality incident. The TRC rate decreased to 0.17 per 100 FTEs, compared to 0.22 in 2020. This is a 23% improvement compared to 2020.\n\nIn 2021, 57% of our industrial units had no recordable injuries. There are 10 industrial sites that have had no recordable injuries over the last 3 years, while 11 sites had achieved more than 500 days injury-free (excluding acquisitions integrated in 2021).\n\n## Recordable cases\n\n|                             |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total recordable  case rate |   0.32 |   0.22 |   0.17 |\n| Lost workday  cases rate    |   0.19 |   0.17 |   0.12 |\n| Fatalities                  |   1    |   0    |   0    |\n\n## Management system\n\nIn 2021, we added two new sites to the scope of our multi-site management compliance system with ISO 45001. Part of our manufacturing sites continued to be certified locally and at the end of 2021, 60% of our reporting manufacturing sites were ISO 45001 certified. The remaining manufacturing sites have procedures in place which assure compliance with local regulations and Signify policies.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## 16.3.5 Business ethics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Signify's Integrity code\n\nOur Integrity code serves as our code of conduct. This code embodies our commitment to always act with integrity, both in our internal and external interactions. The code sets the standard for business conduct of our employees and for the company itself and also gives more information on how to speak up or raise concerns. Translations of our Integrity code are available in 26 languages. For a description of Integrity code processes and policies, please refer to chapter 12, Risk factors and risk management, section 12.1, of this Annual Report.\n\nIn 2021, we focused on increasing awareness of our Integrity reporting channels. We launched a company-wide campaign via various videos and through the company's portal and one of the company's global webcasts. In addition, we used infographics detailing the steps of our investigation process and actively engaged in conversations through posts and polls on our social networking tool. We continued our company-wide Speak up campaign to raise awareness on the importance to speak up when employees encounter integrity concerns. Employees were requested to complete a mandatory e-learning, and by the end of 2021 the completion rate was 92% of the targeted employees.\n\nIn 2021, 195 Integrity code concerns were captured via the Signify Ethics line and through our network of compliance officers, a 10% increase compared to 2020. The number of concerns raised were in line with expectations building on the trends we identified the previous year. Details per category are shown in the table on the next page. In 2021, we also saw an increase in the number of people using the 'Ask a question' functionality in our reporting tool. This functionality was introduced some years ago with the intention to lower the bar for people to approach the Compliance department. We will continue to promote this functionality in the coming period.\n\n## Most commonly reported concerns Treatment of employees\n\nThe category Treatment of employees represents 46% of the total cases reported (48% in 2020). Within this category, the largest subcategory is Equal, fair & respectful treatment. This made up to 66% of the concerns related to Treatment of employees in 2021 (70% in 2020). This category, for example, relates to concerns about verbal abuse, (sexual) harassment, favoritism and matters of discrimination in the workplace. This is a further decrease compared to the percentages in previous years, and may be partly due to a continuation of a high number of employees working from home or remotely in 2021.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nThe second most reported type of concern relates to Business integrity. The number of complaints reported in this segment represents 29% of the total cases reported (33% in 2020).\n\nIn 2021, we saw a further increase in reported cases relating to Security, including IT. This category represents 15% of the total cases reported in 2021 (13% in 2020) and relates, for instance, to concerns about unauthorized use of the company's assets, theft, cyber security or other IT-related concerns. This increase builds on the trend of previous years and Signify continues to actively increase awareness of security and (cyber)crime among its employees.\n\n## Substantiated concerns\n\nAt the start 2021, 46 cases were open. During 2021 a total number of 195 cases were reported. As per December 2021, 29 cases were open. That means that during 2021, we\n\nclosed 212 cases. Of these 212 cases, 81 were found to be substantiated, which represents 38% of the closed cases.\n\nSubstantiated cases are followed up with corrective actions, where possible. Such corrective actions can include additional measures, such as training, strengthening of internal controls, creation of additional policies or other measures that aim to promote or enhance a culture of business compliance. Corrective actions can also take the form of disciplinary action. In 2021, Signify applied disciplinary actions ranging from training, coaching to verbal and written warnings and to termination of employment, depending on the severity of the matter.\n\n## Breakdown of alleged violations Integrity code\n\n|                                           | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Health & Safety                           | -      | 2      | 3      |\n| Treatment of employees                    | 114    | 86     | 90     |\n| \u00b7 Equal, fair and respectful treatment    | 89     | 60     | 59     |\n| \u00b7 Employee development                    | 1      | 4      | 3      |\n| \u00b7 Employee privacy                        | -      | -      | -      |\n| \u00b7 Employee relations                      | 1      | 2      | 5      |\n| \u00b7 Remuneration                            | 2      | 5      | 11     |\n| \u00b7 Right to organize/Collective bargaining | 1      | -      | -      |\n| \u00b7 Working hours                           | 1      | 2      | 2      |\n| \u00b7 HR other                                | 19     | 13     | 10     |\n| Legal                                     | 4      | 7      | 11     |\n| Business integrity                        | 66     | 59     | 56     |\n| Security, including IT                    | 9      | 24     | 30     |\n| Other                                     | 4      | -      | 5      |\n| Total                                     | 197    | 178    | 195    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Responsible tax policy\n\nOur tax principles are based on the recognition that tax is an integral element of our overall corporate social responsibility as well as commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals. The UN and other global organizations have emphasized the importance of fair contributions and are asking for more transparency on tax.\n\nResponsible Tax is an important topic for Signify to report on. For us, acting with integrity means paying the right amount of tax, in the right place, at the right time. Being a responsible taxpayer is aligned with our purpose, business strategy and Integrity Code. Our Tax Principles set the standard for our conduct, by which individual employees, the company and its subsidiaries must abide. The tax principles ensure compliance with local and international tax laws and internationally accepted standards of good corporate governance such as various OECD Guidelines. We are committed to providing timely, regular, and reliable information on Signify's tax position, including the Group effective tax rate, our corporate income tax contributions, and our main tax exposures (see chapter 14, Consolidated financial statements, note 9, of this Annual Report).\n\nSignify has a Tax Control Framework in place, which provides awareness and assurance of adherence to up-to-date tax policies. Risks are managed and monitored through a tool for collecting details on a quarterly basis of all our corporate income tax exposures and provisions. In 2021, Signify implemented a web-based tool for supporting and central monitoring of the filing of all corporate income tax returns worldwide. We monitor\n\nand seek to minimize the number of open tax years. Our Board of Management approves our tax strategy and reviews the tax control framework and our key tax positions. External auditors regularly review our tax controls and our key tax positions as part of the audit of our financial results. The responsibility for tax management ultimately rests at the executive Board of Management with the CFO.\n\nSignify complies with internationally-accepted tax standards (such as OECD guidelines) as well as more local initiatives. In accordance with these international standards, Signify prepares its Country-by-Country report for its entire Group and provides it to the Dutch Tax Authorities. In 2021, we also implemented unified internal standards of reporting under Mandatory Disclosure Rules (DAC6 Directive). Signify's transfer pricing model is driven by the activities undertaken and the value created in each part of our business, and is in accordance with the OECD transfer pricing guideline. As a local initiative, we seek to build open and constructive relationships with tax authorities and participate in cooperative compliance programs or related schemes, for example in the Netherlands.\n\nMore information can be found in our Global Tax Principles: https:// www.assets.signify.com/is/content/ PhilipsLighting/Assets/signify/global/ir/ signify-tax-principles.pdf.\n\n## Product quality\n\nSignify is strongly committed to responsible product stewardship. The Signify quality management system is ISO 9001:2015 certified, covering all business activities. When it comes to quality, we believe\n\nprevention of defects is better than cure. This is reflected in our structured approach towards the selection and qualification of suppliers, manufacturing, installation and delivery of our products and services. In line with mandatory legislation all over the world, Signify is committed to placing only safe products on the market. In the event products have been brought to market that do not meet the essential safety requirements, Signify takes a systematic approach and appropriate actions, which may include a product recall, especially in case the health and safety of individuals are of concern. Signify has a robust process in place to ensure impacted constituents are informed. In 2021, no product safety issues were found that resulted in a material fine or penalty.\n\n## 16.3.6 Cybersecurity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDigitalization is one of our strategic frontiers and our connected lighting offer is expanding. We are focusing on improving our digital front and back-ends and increasing our data analytics capabilities to better serve our customers. In this context, it has been more important than ever to ensure that access to network, IT systems and data is assured at all times. Signify has a dedicated Corporate Security department which focuses on Information, Product and Operational security, and follows the three lines of defense model. We have a cybersecurity team that provides Threat Intelligence, Guidance and Assurance services. Our threat\n\nintelligence team has a defined process for gathering, analyzing, and distributing actionable intelligence on potential threats to Signify, and proactively alerts stakeholders. Our Guidance team is responsible to provide security guidance through the development of Policies, Standards and Process Guidelines, and establish an Enterprise Security Architecture to keep the digital identities, data and environment secure. Our Assurance team performs assessments to validate implementation of standards to assess residual risks and gaps. Our security operation reporting center is responsible for detection, mitigation and resolution of cybersecurity-related incidents, enabling action to be taken in a timely manner. Technical security measures are implemented to support the 'defense in depth' principle, starting from the collection of information to infrastructure controls.\n\nIn 2021, we have created a process to extend the reach of our cybersecurity services directly to business and IT stakeholders. Additionally, our employees were asked to complete a mandatory training on security. Our cybersecurity requirements also apply to our partners and suppliers as part of security schedules and contracts signed as they need to comply with the same standards we set for ourselves. Our cybersecurity processes and measures are based on ISO 27001 (Information security) and ISO 62443 (Product Security) certifications, as well as other related best practices (such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Center of Internet Security (CIS)).\n\nThe threats of phishing and ransomware as well as the insider threat continue to be a\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are constantly trying to evolve and improve our cybersecurity guidance, alerting, monitoring and incident response mechanisms to manage these threats without causing disruptions to Signify businesses. All cybersecurity activities are reported to and monitored by the Security Board, chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Rondolat. Other members of the Security Board are the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Security Officer, and the Heads of Internal Audit, Legal and Human Resources. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are informed regularly.\n\n## 16.3.7 Social impact of light\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Brighter lives revenues\n\nWe are driving change to create brighter futures. With our lighting innovations, we support the health and well-being of people, sustainable food production for a growing global population, and a safer and more secure society. We commit to double our Brighter lives revenues to 32% by the end of 2025, which means our revenues coming from lighting innovations that increase food availability, safety and security, or health and well-being. At the end of 2021, our Brighter lives revenues were between 25% and 27%.\n\nThrough our actions, we directly contribute to the achievement of SDG 3: Good health and well-being.\n\n## Health & well-being\n\nLight is essential for life, equally important as food, water and air. Light allows us to see and to experience the world around us. It affects us visually, biologically and emotionally, supporting comfort, well-being and performance. Scientific evidence shows that light has a powerful impact on our emotions and important physiological and biological processes in our body. Circadian lighting in an office environment for instance makes an office more liveable and up to 12% more productive.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on quality of light in our LED portfolio meeting the EyeComfort criteria which measures factors that can impact the comfort of your eyes (such as flicker or glare). We upgraded the majority of our LED lamps and Hue and WiZ portfolio. We continued to expand our NatureConnect, lighting inspired by Nature. We also focused on Office and Healthcare applications, contributing to employees', patients' and staff's health and well-being. NatureConnect brings the benefits of natural light indoors. Based on combined results of end-user surveys at different customer sites, 80% of the office workers confirmed that the lighting feels like daylight. \"I really feel like I'm outside\" is the most common reaction from customers.\n\nThe continuing coronavirus pandemic shows that health and well-being are top priorities, and lighting can offer reliable disinfection through several UV-C applications. In 2021, our portfolio of new innovative solutions based on our UV-C offering was further extended to help fight the virus.\n\nThe risk of contracting and spreading viruses and bacteria increases in busy and public areas, such as offices, stores, schools, museums and public transport. In laboratory testing, our UV-C light sources inactivated 99% of the SARS-CoV-2 on a surface with an exposure time of 6 seconds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Food availability\n\nTo meet the needs of a growing population, we need to consume resources more efficiently. The global food demand will rise by 70% by 2050, while 80% of arable land globally is already currently farmed. Many of the vegetables we consume are not produced locally and are transported over long distances. Approximately one-third of the world's available food is either spoiled or thrown away before it ever reaches a plate. Overall, the world's current food production and distribution systems contribute to 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions. To answer these challenges, significant changes to our food systems are needed to ensure enough safe, healthy, accessible and affordable food for all in the (near) future.\n\nHorticulture LED technologies can provide an answer by realizing extremely efficient farming with high yields, efficient use of space\n\nand enabling local production, at least a 90% reduction in water use, and avoiding pollution by pesticides. With the right light spectrum and growth recipe, our lighting innovations give better control over climate and crops, and help to achieve high quality and yield at the right time. Our technology applies also to aquaculture, animal centric lighting and water and air purification.\n\n## Safety & Security\n\nFor the past 10 years, lighting has gone through a significant technological transformation, opening new possibilities in using light. With increasing urbanization, street crime and traffic accidents are a real challenge. Interact-connected LED systems and management software improve city services and can help to reduce street crime and night-time traffic accidents, while reducing energy costs. Our connected LED systems also have applications for outdoor homes, enhancing feeling of safety and security.\n\nToday, more than 50 billion devices are connected to the Internet, most of them wirelessly. This is placing wireless communication under increasing pressure, and the radio spectrum is becoming congested. In addition, there are areas where radio frequency wireless communication is not permitted or the best fit. Trulifi by Signify offers a range of LiFi systems, providing a two-way wireless communication that is reliable, secure, and fast. Next to this, Trulifi is immune to any electromagnetic interference from, for example, industrial processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, the Signify Foundation's social impact focus has been on building recovery and resilience for underserved communities by enabling access to light and livelihood development. Lighting interventions designed in collaboration with local groups and aid agencies have made a positive impact on communities, providing better access to health care, essential services, sports, and productivity.\n\nIn its fourth year of operations, the Signify Foundation remains committed to enabling access to the benefits of sustainable lighting for underserved communities. To fulfill this mission, the Foundation partners with actors across the entire value chain that play a key role in the delivery of clean technology-based lighting systems to homes, communal spaces and institutions, empowering communities to be safer, active, and economically productive after sunset. Its work contributes to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular to SDG 5: Gender equality, SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy, SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth, and SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities.\n\nProjects supported by the combined resources of Signify and Signify Foundation have lit 7.2 million lives in communities around the globe and supported 11,784 lighting entrepreneurs (baseline 2017).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Lighting lives program aims to create long-lasting impact through investing in communities and developing market ecosystems, where lighting can be bought and traded. This aim drives the Foundation towards innovative finance models, such as recoverable grants to help social enterprises overcome their barriers to grow and scale.\n\nSignify entities around the globe actively work alongside the Foundation and its partners to light up underprivileged public service institutions like hospitals, schools and sport facilities. In 2021, the Foundation partnered with the Signify South Africa office and Earthrise Trust for a Lighting Lives project to improve the lives of Franshoek and Naledi village communities. Solar lights installed in and around the community centers, farms, and soccer fields allow residents to safely socialize, mobilize, and take part in sports at night, as well as increasing their farming productivity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough its Lighting entrepreneurs programs, the Signify Foundation supports local capacity building, with the focus on business and technical skills, to develop sustainable communities and livelihoods. Its support focuses on empowering people who currently lack access to formal employment, particularly youth and women, and who are motivated to start their own clean energy businesses.\n\nWithin this scope, a women-led last-mile distribution program, 'Bright Dada', kicked off in 2021. Through the program, women entrepreneurs receive business skills training and will start to distribute energy-efficient lighting to remote households in Uganda and Kenya. The program is designed to tackle the gaps in income generation opportunities and access to good quality lighting in rural parts of East Africa.\n\nIncreasing safety and security for vulnerable communities facing natural and man-made disasters remains a priority for the Signify Foundation. This is addressed through the Humanitarian Lighting program. Lighting is a central element in improving security, reducing the incidence of gender-based violence outside the home, improving sanitation and hygiene, and contributing to people's overall sense of dignity.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the Foundation donated 11,000 portable solar lamps for distribution to vulnerable groups in locations throughout Syria, including internally displaced people, people living with a disability, and the elderly. This intervention has a particular focus on women and adolescent girls and aims to integrate lighting into the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s humanitarian response.\n\nThrough the Foundation and Signify's continued focus on these areas, we are on track in our efforts to reach our target of lighting 10 million lives by the end of 2025.\n\nTo learn more about the Foundation, please see the Signify Foundation's Annual Report.",

With the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) as our strategic compass, we set even more ambitious goals through our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, to provide solutions that address some of the most important challenges of our time - for a better world.\n\nIn line with our commitment to Climate action (SDG13) and Affordable and clean energy (SDG7), we are going beyond carbon neutrality and aim at doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C scenario to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over our full value chain by the end of 2025. We will do so by increasing the energy efficiency of our portfolio, to reduce emissions of our customers and by driving carbon reduction at our suppliers. Also, we aim at doubling our revenues from circular products, systems and services by the end of 2025, contributing directly to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).\n\nAll our environmental policies and our management framework are based on the international ISO 14001 standard. In 2021, 83% of our manufacturing sites were certified to ISO 14001.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 16.4.1 Climate action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate leadership\n\nAt Signify, we acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and believe we have an important role to play in the transformation towards a lowcarbon economy, with deep decarbonization across our value chain. Signify is one of the first 28 companies committing to verified Science-Based Targets in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C pathway, to cut GHG emissions in our operations as well as in our value chain. We commit to reduce 70% of absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 30% of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 (baseline 2015).\n\nIn 2021, Signify was again recognized in CDP's Climate A list for our leadership in environmental performance. We continued to partner with the Climate Group's EV100 Initiative to operate a lease fleet of hybrid and fully electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. We remain engaged in the AndersReizen Dutch Business Sustainable Mobility Pledge to further improve the sustainability performance of our business travel.\n\nThrough our partnership with the RE100 Initiative, we shifted to 100% renewable electricity use in 2020. As an active member of Clean Cargo and the WBCSD Transforming Heavy Transport project, we engage in crossindustry collaboration and strive to lower the carbon footprint of our freight transport. We renewed our partnership with Maersk, one of our key partners in ocean freight, and supported them in launching new vessels that operate on zero-carbon fuels. This will help us to scale zero carbon solutions in our supply chain and logistics operations. Our continuous pledge to the World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings commitment facilitates improvement in energy efficiency as well as reduction in electricity consumption in our non-industrial buildings.\n\nIn 2021, we continued our efforts to align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and we established an internal cross-department task force to further assess our climaterelated risks and opportunities and strengthen our climate risk mitigation and adaptation strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This means we aim to achieve the emission reduction goals laid out in the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C pathway for 2031 by 2025, six years early.\n\nBy the end of 2025, we will reduce our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 35% compared to our 2019 baseline year.\n\nIn 2021, we are on track to deliver against our ambitious goal of doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5 \u1d52 scenario.\n\nReporting emissions across the value chain is still a niche practice where Signify is taking the lead. We are working on improving the accuracy of the data used, and have the ambition to include additional Scope 3 data in next year's report.\n\nAs shown in the graph on the right, the large majority of our value-chain emissions lies in the product use phase.\n\n## Doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Signify footprint over its value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Operations (Scope 1, 2, Logistics, Business travel)\n- Scope 3 suppliers\n- Scope 3 use of sold products\n- Scope 3 end-of-life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon neutral in our operations\n\nSince September 2020, we run carbon neutral operations around the globe, which means GHG emissions from our manufacturing facilities (scope 1 and 2), non-industrial locations (scope 1 and 2), upstream and downstream logistics activities (scope 3), and business travel (scope 3) are all carbon neutral. We continue sourcing 100% renewable electricity in our global operations, contributing to the green energy transition.\n\nOver the last decade, Signify reduced its operational footprint by more than 70% and\n\nhas been driving hundreds of initiatives to reduce emissions in factories, offices, logistics and business travel.\n\nIn 2021, total gross CO2 emissions were 290 kilotonnes, a 12% increase year-on-year. This increase can be explained by the integration of Cooper Lighting and Klite into our sustainability commitments. Our operational emission intensity in tonnes of CO2e per million-euro sales was 42 in 2021 (2020: 40).\n\nAs a manufacturing company, we still have residual emissions, such as emissions from the use of natural gas in glass ovens. To fulfil our carbon neutral commitment, we invest in certified carbon offsetting projects.\n\n## Operational carbon footprint in kilotonnes\n\n|        |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross  |    363 |    260 |    290 |\n| Offset |    299 |    260 |    290 |\n| Net    |     64 |      0 |      0 |\n\nIn 2021, we continued to partner with South Pole for carbon offsetting projects that are aligned with our purpose. Among others, we initiated off-grid renewable energy generation with solar panels in India. We continued supporting reforestation and forest conservation in Uruguay and Zimbabwe and continued to engage in increasing the availability of renewable electricity through wind farms in India. Our partnership with South Pole enabled us to offset 100% of our residue emissions, resulting in carbon neutrality across our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is a slight decrease of 3% compared to 2020 despite our acquisitions' integration. In 2021, we continued to lead operational changes and efficiency improvements, for instance through the optimization of heating systems.\n\n## Non-industrial operations\n\nIn 2021, CO2 emissions from non-industrial operations (offices, warehouses) represented 2% of our total operational carbon footprint. In 2021, our emissions from non-industrial operations increased by 2 kilotonnes compared to 2020.\n\n## Logistics\n\nIn 2021, 43% of our total CO2 emissions in our operations were attributed to logistics, and our total emissions from logistics increased by 36% compared to 2020. This is a result of the gradual business recovery from the COVID-19 impact and the integration of Cooper Lighting Solutions and Klite into our sustainability commitments.\n\n## Business travel\n\nIn 2021, our CO2 emissions related to business travel accounted for 2% of our operational carbon footprint. While the total emissions from logistics kept the same level compared to 2020, we lowered emissions from air travel by 33%.\n\n## Energy use in operations\n\nOur total energy usage in 2021 amounted to 3,630 terajoules. Our operational energy intensity in terajoules per million-euro sales was 0.53 in 2021. This is 26% more efficient than 2020 (0.72) and is due to operational optimization, reduced heating requirements and energy efficiency improvements in our factories.\n\n## Electricity\n\nIn 2021, we procured 100% of our electricity from renewable sources. This achievement directly contributes to SDG 7: Clean and affordable energy. All electricity consumed by our operations worldwide was sourced from renewable sources or matched with Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Approximately 11% of our renewable electricity was contracted via our energy providers, 51% was sourced through the procurement of renewable energy certificates, and 38% came from our participation in two Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) in the US and Poland. Our PPAs contribute to the transition to more sustainable electricity grids and reinforce our long-term commitment to using renewable electricity. In 2020 we signed the first panEuropean PPA, which will power our European operations with green electricity from 2023 onward.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As mentioned previously, the majority of our value-chain emissions lies in the product use phase. Helping our customers to reduce emissions through energy efficiency is a vital aspect of our innovation process.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 84.1% of our revenues came from sustainable products, systems and services, overachieving our 2020 target of 80%. In 2021, with our new Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we reviewed our definition and we committed to grow our Climate action revenues to 72% by the end of 2025.\n\nThe energy efficiency criteria to qualify for Climate action revenues became significantly more stringent. Depending on the lumen output, products must have a luminous efficacy of 85 lm/W to 110 lm/W, which is 20% to 65% higher compared with the previous threshold for Sustainable revenues. Climate action revenues are measured as a percentage of the total revenues per product family and tracked for each Division.\n\nAt the end of 2021, between 61% and 64% of our revenues contributed to climate action.\n\nBy delivering cleaner and more energyefficient solutions, we are proud to contribute to the achievement of SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philips LED's A-class bulbs\n\nIn 2021, Signify launched its most energyefficient lamp, while maintaining the same high quality of LED lighting for its consumer. The A-class bulb enables 60% energy reduction compared to standard Philips LED bulbs and has a longer lifespan (50,000 hrs). It provides customers with a smart investment for the planet, saving money and reducing waste.  Thanks to this technological breakthrough, the new products are the first in a range of new Philips LED A-class bulbs meeting the highest level in the new EU energy labeling legislation.\n\n## Enabling carbon reduction at our suppliers\n\nIn 2021, we continued to engage our suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint. Our approach is to proactively initiate, develop and support carbon emissionreduction activities at suppliers through our partnership with the CDP Supply Chain program. In 2021, we invited 698 (2020: 711) of our strategic suppliers to the program, of which 71% submitted the 2021 CDP questionnaire.\n\nThis represents 89% of project-related spend (2020: 91% of the spend). In 2021, 269 strategic suppliers reported emissionreduction activities, overachieving our target of 200 strategic suppliers annually reporting emission reduction activities. 216 of our strategic suppliers disclosed their annual scope 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect) emissions.\n\nIn total, our suppliers undertook more than 260 initiatives in 2021 leading to almost 39 million metric tons of CO2 emissions saved (2020: 32 million metric tons).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Setting Science-Based Targets in China\n\nSignify was one of the first CDP Supply Chain members to start engaging Chinese suppliers on the importance to set Science-Based Targets (SBTs) to reduce carbon emissions. We nominated four of our high-impact China-based suppliers, of which two have now formally signed the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) commitment letter. In a dedicated webinar to our suppliers, we explained how science-based target setting plays an important role in suppliers' evaluation. Once suppliers have formally committed to the SBTi, an emission calculation tool was provided to them to help the establishment of accurate emission rates. Our collaboration with CDP was key to support our suppliers and monitor their progress and progress reports were shared at management level, to initiate actions where needed.",

At Signify, we identified five strategic areas where we will grow our business while furthering our contribution to a better and more sustainable world. These five growth areas are defined based on the major trends facing society, and on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. One of these growth areas is Circular economy. As the world continues to overuse its precious, limited resources, scarce materials will become more challenging to source. We need to do better,\n\nand we believe that the transition to a circular economy is instrumental.\n\nWith circular lighting solutions we can preserve value and avoid waste. That is why, as part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we have the ambition to double our revenues from circular products, systems, and services to 32% by the end of 2025. Additionally, we are committed to more sustainable packaging, removing plastics from all our consumer packaging in 2022, and to sending zero waste to landfill.\n\nOur actions cover the entire life cycle of a product (from production, use and re-use to waste management) and directly contribute to the achievement of SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production.\n\n## Circular lighting portfolio\n\nIn our efforts to transition to a circular economy, we extended our circular lighting portfolio in 2021. Via well-established sustainable design rules, Signify continuously lowers the weight of new product designs, resulting in less material use and costs for our product portfolio. The sustainable design rules are also optimized for circularity, resulting in products that can be upgraded, serviced, reused, refurbished, or recycled. Our circular innovations cover four categories: Serviceable luminaires, Circular components, Intelligent systems, and Circular services.\n\nServiceable luminaires are fixtures that are upgradable, serviceable, connectable, energy-efficient, reusable, and recyclable. In 2021, we upgraded our LuxSpace Accent luminaires to PerfectAccent luminaires\n\ndesigned for a circular economy. These luminaires can easily be serviced, since all components can be replaced without tools, enabling maintenance or upgrading to meet the emerging needs of customers. Instead of replacing the whole luminaire, modules can be exchanged preserving value and avoiding waste. A perfect example of serviceable luminaires is that of our 3D printed luminaires, designed in a modular way and easily upgradable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCircular components are exchangeable and have recyclable parts, such as drivers, controls, and LED boards.\n\nIntelligent systems monitor serviceable luminaires and enable preventive maintenance. Signify connected systems tell us exactly when and where to perform maintenance cutting down on waste, costs, downtime, and manpower.\n\nCircular services aim at prolonging lifetimes and provide customers with our innovative circular services, combining lighting design, installation and maintenance in a single contract.\n\nWe closely monitor and report the progress of the circular portfolio contribution and at",

        "page_content": "the end of 2021, between 21% and 25% of our revenues came from circular products, systems or services.\n\nOur efforts also address supply chain improvements, such as remote serviceability (connected lighting) and end-of-life services. By minimizing material waste and reducing the environmental impact, we create an ecosystem that extends the life of our lighting products and provides a better future for the next generation.\n\n## Zero Waste to landfill\n\nIn 2020 we reached our zero waste to landfill commitment and the highest ever recycling rate. As part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we will continue our efforts and to keep sending zero manufacturing waste to landfill. In 2021, our major focus has been on including our recent acquisitions in our commitment and to drive continuous improvements and process optimization across the globe. At the end of the year, Signify was sending zero waste to landfill according to its commitment and only three sites from our new acquisitions were still transitioning to reach this status.\n\nWe improved our practices regarding waste segregation, waste awareness trainings and sharing best practices across other regions. In 2021, Signify registered 1.96 kilotonnes of hazardous waste (2020: 1.58 kilotonnes), of which 47.5% was recycled. The increase of hazardous waste year-on-year is due to the inclusion of our new acquisitions in our commitments. We will continue our efforts to reduce our hazardous waste by 5% annually.\n\nOur recycling programs address waste arising from manufacturing activities, such as glass or canteen waste, as well as from suppliers, such as packaging materials. 89% of total waste was recycled in 2021 and we continued to recycle 100% of our metal and glass waste.\n\nTotal manufacturing waste consists of waste that is delivered for recycling, incineration or landfill. For more details on our commitment scope, please refer to our Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report.\n\n## Manufacturing waste in kilotonnes\n\n|                        | 2019       | 2020     | 2021        |\n|------------------------|------------|----------|-------------|\n| Recycled               | 32.7 (90%) | 30 (91%) | 38.7 (89%)  |\n| Incinerated            | 2.2 (6%)   | 1.9 (6%) | 3.8 (9%)    |\n| Landfilled             | 1.5 (4%)   | 0.9 (3%) | 0.9 (2%)    |\n| In scope of commitment | 0.7 (2%)   | 0 (0%)   | 0.4 (0.88%) |\n| Total waste            | 36.4       | 32.8     | 43.8        |\n\n## Recycling rate per waste category\n\n|                                 | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Canteen waste                   | 58%    | 43%    | 66%    |\n| Chemical Waste                  | 29%    | 29%    | 36%    |\n| Electrical and Electronic Waste | 90%    | 99%    | 100%   |\n| Glass (line rejects)            | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Metal scrap                     | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Paper/cardboard                 | 99%    | 99%    | 99%    |\n| Plastic waste                   | 84%    | 79%    | 81%    |\n\n## 16.4.3 Responsible packaging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignify pursues a reduction of the environmental impact of its packaging by shifting to responsible materials and by looking into smarter transportation ways. Our packaging policy encourages packaging designers, the purchasing community and\n\nsuppliers to minimize the environmental impact of packaging materials in all phases of the life cycle. This means reducing the amount of packaging used, selecting packaging materials with a high recycled content, and/or selecting virgin packaging materials with a minimal environmental impact from responsible sources. Our packaging policy requires the use of 80% recycled paper, and up to 50% of recycled content when plastic is used.\n\nIn 2019, we started our plastic-free consumer packaging program, committing to phase out all plastic packaging material by the end of 2021. Since 2020, all new LED lamps packaging in Europe shifted from blister to paper boxes. In 2021, we continued our journey by replacing remaining plastic applications, such as plastic bags, protective films, plastic caps, cable binder, tape and stickers. By the end of the year, our consumer packaging was plastic-free in most of our markets.\n\nIn 2021, Signify removed 2,500 tonnes of plastic from its consumer product packaging. Based on our methodology for calculating societal impact, we decreased our societal cost by EUR 0.23 million through eliminating plastic from our packaging in 2021.\n\nOur new packaging is now smaller, reducing carbon emissions from transport and the materials we use by 6,000 tonnes per year equivalent to the amount of CO2 that 270,000 fully grown trees can absorb in a year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 16.4.4 Hazardous substances\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Product substances\n\nThrough sustainable design rules, all new product developments meet stringent sustainability criteria before their market launch. All our products and systems delivered to countries requiring the CE marking are compliant with the RoHS Directive (2011/65/ EU) and REACH (EC 1907/2006) Regulation. We require all our suppliers to communicate all substances in their components and to comply with the stipulations that we have listed in our Regulated Substance List (RSL), which in many cases goes beyond legislation. In 2021, we continued to engage with our suppliers, further rolling out the publicly available BOMcheck tool, in which components and substances can be registered.\n\n## Chemical substances in production processes\n\nWe prioritize the safe management of chemicals to ensure that we minimize the risks of the use of these substances related to the environment, society and our employees in their daily work. If there are threats of harm to human safety or the\n\nenvironment, we proactively search for effective alternatives. We have a robust approach to identify and manage regulated and hazardous substances in our production processes.\n\nWe ensure compliance through continuous monitoring of chemical usage in manufacturing sites and have been actively phasing out several hazardous substances.\n\n## Emissions from mercury\n\nThe target to achieve emissions As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) was met already in 2015 and we continue to closely monitor usage, emissions and exposure and drive further improvement where possible. For instance, since 2012 the emissions from mercury drastically decreased by changing our production processes and replacing liquid mercury with solid-state mercury. Additionally, with the transition from conventional lighting to LED lighting, (solidstate) mercury will further decrease in the coming years.\n\nIn 2021, emissions from mercury and mercury compounds totalled 0 kilogram.\n\n## Emissions from mercury in kilograms\n\n|                    | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mercury and        |        |        |        |\n| mercury  compounds | 1.2    | 0.01   | 0      |\n\n## Emissions from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in lacquering processes\n\nFor years, Signify has been focusing on improving its operations relating to the coating of products to reduce the use of targeted VOCs. In 2021, we continued the shift from chemical painting to water-based paint and powder coating process. As a result, emissions of toluene decreased by\n\n97%. Due to the progressive replacement of coil ballasts with electronic ballasts and the closure of production lines, styrene emissions have been eliminated since 2020.\n\n## Emissions of VOCs in lacquering processes\n\nin tonnes\n\n|                          | 2019   |   2020 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Lead and lead  compounds | 1      |      0 |      0 |\n| Styrene                  | 233    |      0 |      0 |\n| Toluene                  | 65     |     37 |      1 |\n| Xylene                   | 728    |    767 |    822 |\n| category 2  substances   | 1,027  |    804 |    824 |\n\n## 16.4.5 Water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignify recognizes the growing importance of water usage in our everyday activities. As we continue to expand our portfolio of LED products, systems, and services, the water\n\nintensity of our operations continues to decrease. Despite this, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas with water stress, such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico and parts of the United States, and may face water scarcity risks. To analyze and quantify our exposure to water risk, we utilized the open-source Water Risk Monetizer tool by Ecolab, Trucost, and Microsoft. The results show that 23% of our global water consumption is located in regions classified as having high-water scarcity.\n\nWhile some of our facilities have reuse and recycling measures in place, we continued to implement and identify new and more efficient water saving measures as well as continuing our transition to technology and business models which have a lower dependency on water. We aim to reduce our water usage by 5% annually.\n\nTotal water intake in 2021 was 1,432,000 m3, 47% higher than 2020 (971,000 m3). This increase was mainly due to the inclusion of our new acquisitions in our 2021 reporting.\n\n47% of our water intake is used for domestic purposes.\n\n## Water intake in thousands of m3\n\n|             |   2019 | 2020   | 2021         |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------------|\n| Total water |    944 |        | 971    1,432 |\n\nBased on our methodology for calculating societal impact, we caused EUR 3.17 million in costs to society through our water usage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To ensure that animals, such as bats, are not disturbed by artificial lighting during night-time activities, Signify designed a new light spectrum. The light recipe helps in maintaining a balanced ecosystem by displaying minimal attraction for insects, enabling bats to behave the same way as if it was full darkness and preventing lit roads from acting as borders or obstacles to be crossed at night.\n\nIn 2021, Signify assessed the location of its manufacturing sites to identify potential presence in key biodiversity areas or protected areas using the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT). Key biodiversity areas are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. Protected areas are classified according to their management objectives, and examples of protected areas are strict\n\nnature reserve, wilderness area, or protected landscape (source: International Union for Conservation of Nature). Signify uses a total of 179 hectares of land for its manufacturing activities. None of Signify manufacturing sites are located in a protected area, and one is located in a key biodiversity area.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to contribute to conserving and restoring forests, and safeguarding biodiversity in different regions through our carbon offsetting projects and partnership with South Pole. For example, our project in Zimbabwe ensures that 785,000 hectares of forest and wildlife on the southern shores of Zimbabwe's Lake Kariba are now protected. Our landscape reforestation project in Uruguay restored more than 4,500 hectares of forest. Based on our methodology for calculating societal impact, we created EUR 55 million for society through conserving and restoring forest in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 16.4.7\n\n## Environmental incidents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, Signify experienced no significant environmental incidents.",

At Signify, we want to be a catalyst for change, and are committed to doubling our positive impact on the environment and society. We continuously seek opportunities to increase transparency and showcase our leadership.\n\n## The EU Taxonomy reporting framework\n\nTo define what is 'sustainable', the European Commission has developed a catalog of economic activities, each with criteria to determine if they substantially contribute towards a sustainable economy - known as the EU Taxonomy. Companies across diverse sectors, supply chains, and asset classes must use this classification system to assess if their business activities are sustainable according to the Taxonomy. In June 2021, the Commission formally adopted the Climate Delegated Act, establishing the criteria defining which activities substantially contribute to the first two, out of six, environmental objectives of the Taxonomy regulation, namely climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. The remaining four have been planned to be added in 2022.\n\n## Reporting requirements\n\nFor its financial year 2021, Signify shall disclose eligibility on the first two environmental objectives (climate change\n\nmitigation and climate change adaptation); this means, the proportion of Taxonomyeligible and Taxonomy non-eligible economic activities in its total sales, capital and operational expenditure.\n\nThe next step will be to ensure that Signify meets the technical screening criteria associated with each Taxonomy-eligible activity, the 'do no significant harm' (DNSH) criteria and the minimum social safeguards. As the EU requirements for reporting on Taxonomy-aligned activities come into force in January 2023, we will disclose this in our 2022 Annual Report.\n\n## 2021 disclosure requirements\n\n|                        | Sales  1   | CapEx  2   | OpEx  3   |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|-----------|\n| Taxonomy- eligible     | 45%        | 51%        | 44%       |\n| Taxonomy-non- eligible | 55%        | 49%        | 56%       |\n| Total (EUR  million)   | 6,860      | 213        | 456       |\n\nAs reported in section 16.4, in 2021, Signify Climate action revenues were between 61% and 64% (midrange of 62.5% used in this section). The difference with the EU Taxonomy-eligible sales percentage (45%) is explained by excluding sales from those products manufactured by external suppliers. 51% of our CapEx were Taxonomy-eligible and are investments enabling manufacturing of Climate action products. 44% of our OpEx were Taxonomy-eligible and mainly relate to R&D in developing Climate action products.\n\n## Signify 2021 assessment\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible activities\n\nThe currently available definitions as included in the Taxonomy are broadly formulated which leads to companies having to interpret how this applies to its business activities and the impact thereof on eligibility. To our knowledge and understanding, we applied judgment, interpretations and assumptions based on currently available information. Future guidance could result in more accurate definitions and other decisionmaking in meeting reporting obligations, which could impact our future Taxonomy reporting.\n\nSignify assessed its main economic activities and believe these are materially represented under the following NACE codes:\n\n- \u00b7 C27.40 Manufacture of electric lighting equipment\n- \u00b7 F43.21 Electrical installation\n- \u00b7 G46.47 Wholesale of furniture, carpets and lighting equipment\n- \u00b7 N77.40 Leasing of intellectual property and similar products, except copyrighted works\n\nThis assessment is subject to certain management judgements and interpretations of the Taxonomy regulation.  Signify determines sales from self-manufactured products part of C27.40. Sales from products manufactured by external suppliers, part of G46.47. We concluded that our activities captured under C.27.40 and F43.21 are Taxonomy-eligible. Signify's activities captured under C27.40 are manufacturing activities of indoor and outdoor lighting\n\nproducts and systems. Signify's activities captured under F43.21 are installation of lighting equipment.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible sales\n\nSignify defines Taxonomy-eligible sales as sales from products in its portfolio using its Climate action revenues definition (see section 16.4.1 of this chapter), excluding sales from those products manufactured by external suppliers.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx)\n\nSignify has defined each economic activity at Business Unit (BU) level. Signify used the percentage of Taxonomy-eligible sales per BU and multiplied this to the total BU CapEx to approximate the Taxonomy-eligible CapEx. The same approach is used to approximate Taxonomy-eligible OpEx. Signify defines CapEx under the Taxonomy as investments in tangible and intangible assets, including right-of-use assets and assets resulting from business combinations (excluding goodwill). Signify's defines OpEx under the Taxonomy as directly incurred, non-capitalized costs relating to research and development, building renovations, short-term leases and the repair and maintenance of property, plant and equipment and other fixed asset costs. As these costs are not separately disclosed in the Annual Report a reference cannot be made. A full reconciliation was made to the total reported sales, CapEx and OpEx information to avoid double counting in the allocation of the numerators.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(hereafter: the Company) based in Eindhoven,\n\nthe Netherlands. The financial statements comprise the consolidated and company financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Signify N.V. as at December 31, 2021 and of its result and its cash flows for 2021 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EUIFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n- \u00b7 The accompanying company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Signify N.V. as at December 31, 2021 and of its result for 2021 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n\nWe have audited the sustainability information in the annual report for the year 2021 of Signify N.V. based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (hereafter: the annual report). The scope is described in the section Our Scope of our report. An audit is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nIn our opinion, the sustainability information presents, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:\n\n- \u00b7 The policy and business operations with regard to sustainability\n- \u00b7 The thereto related events and achievements for the year 2021\n\nin accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards (option Comprehensive) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, section 16.1, of this Annual Report 2021, of Signify N.V.\n\n## Basis for our opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the financial statements and our audit of the sustainability information in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing and the Dutch Standard 3810N 'Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports' respectively, which is a specified Dutch Standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, 'Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information'.

        "page_content": "'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics)'.\n\n## Our scope\n\n## Our engagements scope\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2021\n- \u00b7 the following statements for 2021: the consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity\n- \u00b7 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nThe company financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 the company balance sheet as at December 31, 2021\n- \u00b7 the company profit and loss account for 2021\n- \u00b7 the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nThe sustainability information is included in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, sections 3.2 and 3.3, chapter 4, Corporate performance, section 4.2, and chapter 16, Sustainability statements, sections 16.1 to 16.4 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our audit engagement on the sustainability information\n\nThe sustainability information includes prospective information, such as goals, strategy, plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates. Inherent to prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the sustainability information.\n\nWith regards to the Company's sustainability information, the 2019 baseline is based on Signify's best estimates available at the time of establishing the Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 doubling commitments. Furthermore, we understand Signify is working on further improvements on both availability and accuracy of the data used in its sustainability reporting.  Therefore, neither the 2019 baseline assumptions, nor the 'Double the pace of the Paris Agreement' are included in the scope of our audit engagement of the sustainability information. We refer to chapter 16, Sustainability statements, sub-section 16.4.1 of this Annual Report for more information.\n\nCalculations to determine societal impact as included in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, section 3.3, of this Annual Report are mostly based on external sources and by using several assumptions. The assumptions and sources used are explained in the document 'Methodology for societal impact calculations' and the 'Supplement to the 2021 Sustainability statements' as available on the website of Signify N.V. We have not performed procedures on the assumptions or external sources, other than evaluating the\n\nsuitability and plausibility of these assumptions and external sources used.\n\nThe references to external sources or websites in the sustainability information are not part of the sustainability information as audited by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe information in the scope of our engagements needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria. Signify N.V. is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting. The reporting criteria used for the preparation of this Annual Report are described in the section Our opinions, of our report.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure sustainability information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\n## Information in support of our opinions\n\nWe designed our audit procedures in the context of both our audit of the financial statements and our audit of the sustainability\n\ninformation as a whole and in forming our opinions thereon. The following information in support of our opinions and any findings were addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n## Our understanding of the business\n\nSignify N.V. is a global provider of lighting solutions. The group is structured in components and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by the operations of the group and our risk assessment. We start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and the sustainability information, whether due to fraud or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk that the financial statements or the sustainability information is misleading or unbalanced, or the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of\n\ninternal control.\n\n## Materiality\n\n## General\n\nThe scope of our audit procedures is influenced by the application of materiality. Our audit engagements aim to provide assurance about whether the financial statements and the sustainability information\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or errors. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the (economic) decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements and the sustainability information. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our assurance procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusions.\n\n## Financial statements\n\nMateriality\n\n\u20ac 32 million\n\nBenchmark applied\n\n(2020: \u20ac 26 million)\n\n4% of adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization ('adjusted EBITA')\n\nExplanation Based on our professional judgment we consider earnings-based measures as the most appropriate basis to determine materiality. Adjustments are made to earnings before interest, taxes and amortization for elements which are not directly related to the operational performance of the company as disclosed in chapter 18, Reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures, of this Annual Report. We changed the benchmark applied from adjusted profit before taxes as applied in 2020 to adjusted EBITA for 2021 to better align with the company's key performance measures.\n\nWe have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of \u20ac 1.5 million, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Sustainability information\n\nBased on our professional judgment we determined specific materiality levels for each relevant part of the sustainability information and for the sustainability information as a whole. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the organization.\n\nWe have agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements which are identified during the audit and which in our view must be reported on quantitative or qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.\n\n## Scope of the group audit of the financial statements\n\nSignify N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit.\n\nIn this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit engagement were performed remotely. The review of audit work papers of component teams was facilitated by having remote access to component teams' electronic audit file platforms, by screen sharing and obtaining copies of work papers directly from the component teams. We increased the frequency and attendance of our interactions with component teams.\n\nFollowing our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to Signify N.V.'s consolidated financial statements, we have selected 2 components which required an audit of the complete financial information (Full Scope Components). We have selected 28 components requiring audit procedures on specific account balances that we considered to have the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile (Specific Scope Components). We used the work of other EY member firms when auditing entities outside the Netherlands. We centrally performed audit procedures on accounting areas which are managed centrally such as goodwill, legal claims and treasury.\n\nAs a result of our scoping, our actual coverage varies per account balance. In addition, the level of detail of our audit procedures per account balance varies depending on our risk assessment.\n\nOf the remaining components, we performed risk-based analytical procedures to respond to any potential risks of material misstatements to the financial statements.\n\nAccordingly, our coverage of the group's Revenues and Total Assets can be summarized as follows:\n\n## Revenues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "By performing the procedures mentioned above at components of the group, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Teaming and use of specialists\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in Signify's industry. We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury and income tax and have made use of our own experts in the areas of valuations and actuaries.\n\n## Our focus on climate risks and the energy transition\n\nClimate objectives will be high on the public agenda in the next decades. Issues such as CO2 reduction impact financial reporting, as these issues entail risks for the business operation, the valuation of assets ('stranded assets') and provisions or the sustainability of the business model and access to financial markets of companies with a larger CO2 footprint.\n\nAs part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which climate-related risks and the possible effects of the energy transition are taken into account in estimates and significant assumptions as well as in the design of relevant internal control measures by Signify N.V. Furthermore, we read the management\n\nboard report and considered whether there is any material inconsistency between the non-financial information in chapter 16 Sustainability statements and the financial statements.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and noncompliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that both the financial statements and the sustainability information taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nWe identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements and the sustainability information due to fraud. During our audits we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to chapter 12, Risk factors and risk management, of this Annual Report for management's (fraud) risk assessment and to chapter 8, Supervisory Board report, section 8.2, in which the Supervisory Board reflects on this (fraud) risk assessment.\n\nWe evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle blower procedures and incident registration. We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness, of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nWe considered available information and made inquiries of relevant executives, directors (including internal audit, legal, compliance and heads of Divisions) and the Supervisory Board. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk\n\nfactors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present. As Signify N.V. is a global company, operating in multiple jurisdictions, we considered the risk of bribery and corruption.\n\nAs in all of our audits, when identifying and assessing fraud risks, we presumed that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition and risks related to management override of controls.\n\n## Presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition and management override of controls\n\n## Fraud risk\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe performed among others the following audit procedures, directed specifically to these fraud risks:\n\n- \u00b7 We have used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries\n- \u00b7 In addition, we performed procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in section 'Basis of preparation' in note 1 to the financial statements\n- \u00b7 Furthermore, we examined the business rationale of significant transaction with related parties or that otherwise appeared to be unusual\n\nWe further describe our audit procedures responsive to the presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition and management override in the description of our key audit matter 'Improper revenue recognition and risk of management override'.\n\nWhen identifying and assessing fraud risks we presume that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition and management override. We evaluated that revenue from sales of goods recognized at a point in time in particular gives rise to such risks.\n\nWe also considered whether the judgments and assumptions in the determination of these revenues indicate a management bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The fraud risks we identified, enquiries and other available information did not lead to specific indications for fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the view of the financial statements or the sustainability information.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audits. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n\n## Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry experience, through discussions with the management board, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.\n\nWe also inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.\n\n## Our audit response related to going concern\n\nAs disclosed in section 'Basis of preparation' in note 1 to the financial statements, management made a specific assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with\n\nmanagement exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism.\n\nWe considered whether management's going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, contains all events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we did not identify significant doubts on Signify's ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months.\n\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements and our audit of the sustainability information. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nThe following key audit matters are modified, excluded or new compared to the key audit matters included in our last year's auditor's report:\n\n## Key audit matters for the audit of the financial statements\n\n| Key audit matter 2020                                                           | Change   | Reason for change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Valuation of deferred  tax assets and liabilities  for uncertain tax  positions | Modified | The key audit matter has been changed to 'Valuation of  uncertain tax positions (assets and liabilities)'.

        "page_content": "## 18 Reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures\n\n## Explanation of non-IFRS financial measures\n\nCertain parts of this Annual Report contain financial measures that are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. These are commonly referred to as non-IFRS financial measures and include items such as comparable sales growth, adjusted gross margin, EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, free cash flow and other related ratios.\n\nAlthough the non-IFRS financial measures presented are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS, the company uses these measures to monitor the underlying performance of its business and operations. These measures have not been audited or reviewed by the company's external auditor. Furthermore, these measures may not be indicative of the company's historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the company's future results. These measures are presented in this Annual Report because the company considers them an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which it operates, as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity.\n\n## Comparable sales growth\n\nThe company discloses comparable sales growth as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure, as the company believes that the presentation of comparable sales growth is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate the performance of the company's business activities over time. The company determines comparable sales growth by deducting the percentage figures for changes from the nominal change of sales. Interaction effects between currency movements, changes in consolidation, regulatory changes and changes in accounting standards (second order effects) are not taken into account. The company presents comparable sales growth on both a Division and Market Group basis. Comparable sales growth is also used by the company as a key financial measure to assess the operating performance of the Divisions and Market Groups.\n\n## Sales growth composition per business in %\n\n|                       | Comparable  growth   | Currency  effects   | Consolidation  and other  changes   | Nominal  growth   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Digital Solutions     | 3.4                  | (2.3)               | 7.3                                 | 8.3               |\n| Digital Products      | 8.8                  | (1.5)               | (0.1)                               | 7.2               |\n| Conventional Products | (6.9)                | (1.7)               | 0.0                                 | (8.7)             |\n| Signify               | 3.8                  | (2.0)               | 3.6                                 | 5.5               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company understands that these measures are used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the company's performance. The company presents EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio on a Division basis. The company also believes that the presentation of EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio provide useful information to investors on the development of the company's business and enhance the ability of investors to compare profitability across the Divisions. In the case of EBITA, the company believes that it makes the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out the amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill, which arises when acquisitions are consolidated by the company. In the case of Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio, the company believes that these measures make the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental charges which are not directly related to the operational performance of a Division. EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio are also used by the company as key financial measures to assess the operating performance of the Divisions.\n\n## Adjusted EBITA to Income from operations (EBIT) in millions of EUR\n\n| 2021                             | Signify   | Digital  Solutions   | Digital  Products   | Conventional  Products   | Signify  Other   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITA                   | 795       | 397                  | 339                 | 161                      | (102)            |\n| Restructuring                    | (86)      | (19)                 | (4)                 | (5)                      | (58)             |\n| Acquisition-related charges      | (50)      | (49)                 | (1)                 | -                        | -                |\n| Incidental items                 | (22)      | (11)                 | (10)                | 2                        | (4)              |\n| EBITA                            | 636       | 318                  | 323                 | 158                      | (164)            |\n| Amortization  1                  | (122)     | (114)                | (7)                 | -                        | (1)              |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)  2 | 514       | 205                  | 316                 | 158                      | (165)            |\n\n## 2020\n\n| Adjusted EBITA                   | 695   | 330   | 295   | 170   | (100)   |\n|----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Restructuring                    | (83)  | (30)  | (10)  | (23)  | (19)    |\n| Acquisition-related charges      | (63)  | (62)  | (1)   | -     | -       |\n| Incidental items                 | (13)  | (8)   | (6)   | 3     | (1)     |\n| EBITA                            | 536   | 230   | 277   | 149   | (120)   |\n| Amortization  1                  | (120) | (111) | (8)   | -     | (1)     |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)  2 | 416   | 119   | 269   | 149   | (122)   |\n\n## Adjusted gross margin\n\nThe company discloses adjusted gross margin as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure.

The company understands that free cash flow is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the company's performance. The company also believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash generated by the company's operating activities after deducting cash outflows for additions of intangible assets, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. Therefore, the measure gives an indication of the long-term cash generating ability of the company's business. In addition, because free cash flow is not impacted by purchases of businesses, it is less volatile than the total of cash flows from operating and investing activities. Free cash flow is also used by the company as a key financial measure to assess the operating performance of the company.\n\n## Composition of cash flows in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                            | 2020    | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                       | 891     | 704    |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                       | (1,379) | (91)   |\n| Cash flows before financing activities                     | (488)   | 613    |\n| Cash flows from operating activities                       | 891     | 704    |\n| Net capital expenditures:                                  |         |        |\n| \u00b7  Additions of intangible assets                          | (32)    | (34)   |\n| \u00b7  Capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment   | (67)    | (84)   |\n| \u00b7  Proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment | 25      | 27     |\n| Free cash flows                                            | 817     | 614    |\n\n## Free cash flows in millions of EUR\n\n| 1                        | 2020   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Digital Solutions        | 436    | 364    |\n| Digital Products  1      | 406    | 383    |\n| Conventional Products  1 | 188    | 136    |\n| Other                    | (213)  | (270)  |\n| Signify total            | 817    | 614    |\n\n1.\n\n- Excluding non-allocated free cash flow items (e.g. tax, interest).\n\n<!-- image -->",

These fair values are based on market prices, where available, and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable. Readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid on the balance sheet date. When quoted prices or observable market values do not exist, fair values are estimated using valuation models, which we believe are appropriate for their purpose. They require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments which are inherently\n\nuncertain and may therefore deviate from actual developments. Critical assumptions used are disclosed in the financial statements. In certain cases, independent valuations are obtained to support management's determination of fair values.\n\n## IFRS basis of presentation\n\nThe financial information included in this document is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU), as explained in significant accounting policies, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Statutory financial statements\n\nChapter 14, Consolidated financial statements and chapter 15, Signify N.V. financial statements, of this Annual Report, contain the statutory financial statements of Signify N.V.\n\n## Regulated information\n\nThis document contains regulated information within the meaning of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",
