        "page_content": "## Letter to our stakeholders\n\nThe past year has been extraordinary, with various external factors impacting the markets where we operate, in particular the extreme volatility in the energy markets and the continued COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, we achieved significant results, both strategically, operationally, and financially.\n\nWe owe a huge thanks to all the talented and dedicated employees in \u00d8rsted. They made these achievements possible.\n\n## The global climate challenge is more pressing than ever\n\nNever before has the world's climate challenges been greater and the message from science clearer: As a global community, we need to act now to preserve our planet. In its recent report, the IPCC concluded that climate change is already happening, and that we will see significantly higher global temperature increases than the 1.5 \u00b0C threshold defined by science, unless we take profound action, both in the short and long term.\n\nWith more than 70 % of the world's carbon emissions coming from the production and use of energy, the transition to a sustainable energy system is at the core of combatting climate change. Over the past decade, renewable energy has been substantially industrialised, and today, renewable energy is the main energy technology being deployed. In 2020, more than 75 % of all new power generation capacity commissioned globally came from renewables, up from 26 % just a decade ago (BNEF).\n\nThe need to fight climate change by transforming our global energy systems will require a massive renewable build-out: Estimates by IRENA suggest that the renewable installed base, including hydroelectric, geothermal, and marine energy, will have to grow more than tenfold, from 2,500 GW today to more than 28,000 GW by 2050.\n\n## Setting a strong strategic aspiration for \u00d8rsted\n\nWith more than 30 years of experience in renewables and as one of the five largest renewable energy companies in the world and the undisputed leader in offshore wind,\n\nwe want to play our part in realising this massive build-out over the coming decades to help solve the greatest challenge facing humanity. At our Capital Markets Day in June, we presented our strategic aspiration to become the world's leading green energy major by 2030. We will accelerate our global buildout of renewable energy, and we have set an ambition to reach approx. 50 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030, up from 13.0 GW by the end of 2021. To support this ambitious build-out, we have a clear strategic direction: We want to develop \u00d8rsted across three core technologies, which we believe will all play a key role in the future energy systems: offshore wind, onshore renewables (wind, solar PV, and storage), and renewable hydrogen and green fuels. By combining these technologies, we can offer our customers fully integrated multiproduct renewable solutions, including longterm power purchase agreements.\n\n## Extraordinary market conditions\n\nIn many ways, the past year has been extraordinary with various external factors impacting the markets where we operate.\n\nIn particular, the weather had an adverse impact on our business in 2021. During most of the year, we experienced significantly lower wind speeds than normal, especially in northwestern Europe where we have most of our operating offshore portfolio. And in February, Texas was subject to an unprecedented winter storm, which not only challenged our business, but all communities affected. The cold weather was accompanied by surging power prices as conventional and renewable capacity across the state failed under the tough conditions. The European energy crunch in the last part",

This proves our ability to differentiate and compete in offshore wind despite increasing price competition.\n\nIn the US, we have been awarded 1,148 MW in New Jersey for our Ocean Wind 2 project and 846 MW in Maryland for our Skipjack 2 project. In Poland, we were awarded 2,543 MW for our Baltica 2 & 3 projects together with our partner PGE.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Onshore, we added 1.2 GW of firm capacity through organic growth and acquisitions in Europe and the US, and we installed our 1,000th onshore wind turbine in 2021.\n\nThese very strong contributions increased our firm capacity to 26.1 GW by the end of 2021 from 20.4 GW at the end of 2020; and keeps us well on track to deliver on our 2030 ambition of 50 GW renewable capacity.\n\nThe year 2021 was also a year where we signed and closed key partnerships for our offshore wind farms, including key partners such as Norges Bank Investment Management (Borssele 1 & 2), CDPQ and Cathay Private Equity (Greater Changhua 1), and New Jersey's\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPublic Service Enterprise Group (Ocean Wind 1). Furthermore, we signed a partnership with Glennmont Partners (Borkum Riffgrund 3). This agreement was special as it was the firstever farm-down signed prior to final investment decision (FID). All these partnerships are a strong testament to the attractiveness of our offshore assets.\n\nIn Germany, we took FID on our originally fully merchant Borkum Riffgrund 3 project and the Gode Wind 3 project. Besides the pre-FID farmdown, the Borkum Riffgrund 3 FID was enabled by major CPPAs, including with REWE Group, Amazon, and BASF. The two projects expand our German portfolio to six wind farms and will help Germany reach climate neutrality by 2045.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In the US, we continue to see strong development and progress being made in maturing our industry-leading 5 GW development pipeline of projects, with the first FIDs expected in 2022 and 2023. Our first projects, that have been exposed to the federal permitting delays, carry costs related to developing a local supply chain which, together with current cost inflation, are impacting the value creation. We continue pursuing all technical, commercial, and regulatory levers at our disposal to improve returns on these projects, in the same way as we always do. The continuous fast progress of the federal permitting processes as well as the proposed clean-energy tax policies being considered in Congress are important supportive factors, not only for our projects, but for the accelerated build-out of offshore wind in the US in general.\n\nDuring the year, we have also entered into several key strategic partnerships. In the Baltics, we will work with Enefit to contribute to the region's green ambitions. In Vietnam, we entered into a strategic collaboration with T&T, in Korea with POSCO, KOMIPO, and KOSPO, and in Japan with Japan Wind Development Co. (JWD) and Eurus Energy. We have also taken steps to drive the commercialisation of floating offshore wind by partnering with Fred. Olsen Renewables and Hafslund Eco in Norway and by entering into a joint venture with BlueFloat Energy and Falck Renewables in Scotland. In January 2022, we were awarded a 1 GW floating offshore wind site off the northeast coast of Scotland. By securing this seabed lease area, we are confirming our ambitions in floating offshore wind.\n\nIn Onshore, we expanded our onshore platform to Europe with the strategic acquisition of Brookfield Renewable Ireland (BRI), contributing with a portfolio of development projects and providing a springboard for further expansion in Europe. Besides this, we finalised the acquisition of Lincoln Land, a 302 MW project in Illinois, which marks our entry into the attractive MISO energy market in the US Midwest. We also took investment decisions on Helena Energy Center, Lisheen 3, and Ballykeel (in 2022), totalling more than 560 MW.\n\nIn our renewable hydrogen and green fuels business, we also saw strong progress. Our first 2 MW demonstration-scale project, H2RES, is expected to go into operation in the first half of 2022, while four projects are progressing in the IPCEI funding process. Our Green Fuels for Denmark (GFDK) project, Yara Sluiskil, HySCALE, and our Lingen Green Hydrogen projects have all been shortlisted as IPCEI projects in their respective countries and now await the final IPCEI approval by the EU Commission and the subsequent funding commitment. In the US, we joined forces with Williams to explore potential Power-to-X projects in Western Wyoming. In January 2022, we signed an agreement with Liquid Wind, a Swedish green e-methanol developer, to acquire a 45 % stake in their project FlagshipONE. The project is expected to produce 50,000 tonnes of e-methanol per year, based on renewable hydrogen and biogenic CO 2 . Also in January 2022, we joined forces with German steel major Salzgitter on development of green power, green hydrogen, and green steel with a focus on circularity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInstallation of substation at Hornsea 2, off the Yorkshire coast, the UK.\n\n## Strong operational performance and good construction progress\n\nWe achieved strong operational performance in 2021, with our assets remaining fully operational and with normal availability rates.\n\nWe are currently constructing two of the world's largest offshore wind farms, Hornsea 2 in the UK and Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan.\n\nFor Hornsea 2, we saw progress according to plan up until mid-December. However, the accelerating Omicron variant infection rates meant that it was not possible to man the vessels used for commissioning work according to plan. As a consequence, the ramp-up\n\nprofile will be delayed compared to our internal expectations, but we still expect to commission Hornsea 2 in H1 2022 as previously communicated.\n\nWe are well on track on the construction of Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan. The project follows our committed timeline and is planned for commissioning in 2022.\n\nIn Onshore, we have made several key additions to our portfolio of operating wind and solar farms and added 1.7 GW of new installed capacity in 2021. In the US, we successfully completed Western Trail, our biggest onshore wind farm to date, and we commissioned our first combined solar PV and storage facility, Permian",

        "page_content": "Energy Center, both in Texas. Furthermore, we commissioned the solar farm Muscle Shoals in Alabama. Our onshore renewable platform now includes 3.4 GW of installed capacity.\n\nAlso in the US, our solar panel release orders from Chinese supplies were withheld due to forced labour issues, a decision we fully support. It has slowed down panel deliveries, causing some delay in the commissioning of Old 300 and in the construction of the solar phase at Helena Energy Center. However, we still expect both solar farms to be commissioned in 2022.\n\n## Achieving our financial expectations\n\nOur operating profit (EBITDA), including farmdowns, amounted to DKK 24.3 billion, a 34 % increase compared to 2020. Operating profit excluding new partnerships amounted to DKK 15.8 billion, which compares to our guidance of DKK 15-16 billion at the beginning of the year.\n\nThus, we came in well in line with our expectations and delivered strong financial results despite unforeseen negative impacts in Offshore during the year, including lower wind speeds, the European energy crunch, and further provisions due to updated wake assumptions and cable protection system issues at some of our offshore wind farms. This was due to exceptionally good performance by our CHP plants and gas business.\n\nThe return on capital employed (ROCE) was 15 %, and profit for the year amounted to DKK 10.9 billion. The Board of Directors recommends paying a dividend of DKK 12.5 per share, corresponding to DKK 5.3 billion and an increase of 8.7 %.\n\nDuring the year, we have prepared for reporting according to the EU taxonomy, which in short describes the sustainability of a company's activities. We are pleased to report that 66 % of our revenue, 80 % of our OPEX, 90 % of our EBITDA, and 99 % of our gross investments were taxonomy-eligible in 2021.\n\n## Driving a sustainable build-out of green energy\n\nSustainability is at the core of our business. In 2021, as the first energy company in the world, our 2040 target of becoming net-zero in our entire value chain (scope 1-3 emissions) was validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We consider this a landmark achievement, which sets a new standard for corporate decarbonisation targets globally. We are fully on track to become entirely carbon-neutral in scope 1 and 2 by 2025, so the next frontier for us will be to fully decarbonise our supply chain by 2040. This is a monumental task, which will require unprecedented technological innovation and cross-industry collaboration. We are working actively with our strategic suppliers on this agenda. Furthermore, we have made the strategic commitment to gradually phase out our natural gas portfolio towards 2040, with a clear mid-term target of reducing scope 3 emissions by 50 % in the period from 2018 to 2032.\n\nAs we build out renewable energy globally, protecting nature and biodiversity will be key. That is why in 2021, we embarked on our next major strategic sustainability journey, setting the ambition to deliver a net-positive biodiversity impact from all energy projects that we commission by 2030 at the latest. This will be an ambitious journey in the years to come, but\n\nwe are convinced that real leadership is about doing what is right, even if we do not have all the answers yet.\n\n## Continued attention to people\n\nBeing a socially inclusive and diverse company in all its many forms is of paramount importance to us. We are fully committed to driving diversity in our company and have set the ambition to employ at least 40 % women across \u00d8rsted's organisation by 2030, both in the company overall and among our leaders. With 31 % women and 69 % men today, we still have some way to go to become a more gender-balanced company, and we are implementing several initiatives to drive this important agenda. Diversity is clearly not just about gender, but we see this commitment as an important and tangible step to create a fully inclusive culture.\n\nOur success relies more than anything on our employees, and we are happy to be part of such a capable, curious, and dedicated team. In this sense, we are delighted to see that our 2021 employee satisfaction survey yet again showed a high motivation and satisfaction score of 77 out of 100.\n\nIn December, CFO Marianne Wiinholt announced that she will pursue a career outside \u00d8rsted. Marianne will step down in April. We would like to thank Marianne for her fantastic contributions to \u00d8rsted over the past 17 years and wish her all the best in the future.\n\nSafety is another value of paramount importance to us, both when it comes to protecting the physical conditions of our employees and to creating an inclusive and open environment\n\nwhere all employees can thrive. Again this year, we are pleased to see a downwards trend in our total recordable injury rate (TRIR) to a score of 3.0, down from 3.6 in 2020. As we almost achieved our previous target of 2.9 in 2025, we have raised our ambition to a target of 2.5.\n\nTo read more about our work on diversity, safety, and our other sustainability priorities, go to our sustainability report here.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe have come a long way and have built a strong position as the undisputed global offshore leader. However, despite having transformed from a fossil-based energy company to the world's most sustainable energy corporation, we are not done with our transformation. As we demonstrated to an entire industry that large-scale offshore wind was feasible and scalable, we will continue to apply our courage and capability to innovate, scale, and accelerate the transformation of the world's energy systems and thereby continue to be a catalyst for a world that runs entirely on green energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThomas Thune Andersen Chairman\n\nMads Nipper Group President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Bioenergy & Other - significantly lower\n\nEarnings from both our CHP plants (including ancillary services) and 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure' are expected to be significantly lower than in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, our CHP plants benefitted from the very high power prices and spreads in the last four months of the year, which also led to an unusually high power generation, and large demand for ancillary services. This is not expected to be repeated to the same extent in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, earnings in 'Gas Markets & Infrastructure' were positively impacted by a one-off effect in connection with the renegotiation of gas purchase contracts together with strong underlying performance in a very volatile and bullish gas market where we were able to optimise purchase from our long-term gas contracts. In 2022, we expect earnings to be fairly limited, reflecting normal margins on these activities.\n\n## Gross investments\n\nGross investments for 2022 are expected to amount to DKK 38-42 billion. The outlook reflects a high level of activity in Offshore (Hornsea 2, Greater Changhua 1 & 2a, Borkum Riffgrund 3, Gode Wind 3, Ocean Wind 1, and our US North East cluster projects) and in Onshore (Helena Energy Center, Old 300, and projects from our substantiated pipeline).\n\nIn addition to gross investments, significant funds are temporarily tied up in the construction of transmission assets for offshore wind farms in the UK and offshore wind farms for our partners. These funds are a part of our\n\noperating cash flow. At the end of 2021, funds tied up in work in progress totalled DKK 5.9 billion. We still expect to see a high level of funds tied up in work in progress in 2022 as a result of the continued construction of the transmission assets at Hornsea 2. As part of the expected farm-down of Hornsea 2 in 2022, we will divest 50 % of the transmission assets to the partner, whereas we expect to divest our own 50 % share of the Hornsea 2 offshore transmission assets in 2023.\n\n## Uncertainties, prices, and hedges\n\nOur offshore wind farms are largely subject to regulated prices, implying a high degree of revenue certainty. This means that we know the price per generated MWh for most wind farms in Denmark and Germany, our first Dutch wind farm, and the CFD wind farms in the UK. For our British ROC wind farms, we also know the subsidy per generated MWh which we will receive in addition to the market price.\n\nThe part of our generation from offshore and onshore assets which is exposed to market prices has, to a large extent, been hedged for 2022. The same applies to our currency risks. Generation from our CHP plants is partly hedged.\n\nBesides earnings from potential new partnerships, the most significant uncertainty to the operating profit in 2022 is the power generation, which depends on wind conditions, ramp-up of new wind and solar assets, asset availability, timing of farm-downs, and the attractiveness of spreads on our CHP plants. In addition, high gas and power price volatility could impact earnings for the year through higher balancing and intermittancy costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFormosa 1, off the coast of Miaoli County, Taiwan.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThe annual report contains forward-looking statements which include projections of our short- and long-term financial performance and targets as well as our financial policies. These statements are by nature uncertain and associated with risk. Many factors may cause the actual development to differ materially from our expectations.\n\nThese factors include, but are not limited to, changes in temperature, wind conditions, wake and blockage effects, precipitation levels, the development in power, coal, carbon, gas, oil, currency, inflation rates, and interest rate markets, changes in legislation, regulations, or standards, the renegotiation of contracts, changes in the competitive environment in our markets, and reliability of supply.

DKK 350 billion, of which approx. 80 % is expected to be within Offshore (incl. renewable hydrogen) and approx. 20 % within Onshore. Net of the expected proceeds from farm-downs, investments are expected to be approx. DKK 200 billion.\n\nIn the period 2020-2027, we expect a growth in operating profit (EBITDA) from offshore and onshore assets in operation of approx. 12 % a year on average, reaching a level of DKK 35-40 billion in 2027. The growth rate assumes a 50 % ownership stake in new offshore projects. Potential farm-down gains will come on top of the operational EBITDA CAGR.\n\nOur target is an average return on capital employed (ROCE) of approx. 11-12 % for the\n\nGroup in the 2020-2027 period, including the potential farm-down gains.\n\nThe largest share of \u00d8rsted's operating profit (EBITDA) will be generated by long-term contract-based or regulated activities, and we expect an average of around 90 % of EBITDA in the period 2020-2027 to stem from this.\n\n## Financial policies\n\nThe Board of Directors will recommend to the annual general meeting that a dividend of DKK 12.5 per share be paid for 2021, equating an increase of 8.7 % and a total of DKK 5.3 billion.\n\nSupported by the expected increase in cash flows from future offshore and onshore assets, we still intend to increase annual dividends by a high single-digit percentage compared to the previous years' dividends, covering the period through 2025.\n\nOur dividend policy and other expected capital allocations are subject to our commitment to our BBB+/Baa1 rating profile. During 2021, we updated the calculation method and correspondingly lowered our capital structure ratio target to 25 % to better align with the rating agencies.\n\n| Financial estimates                                                              | Target                           | Year                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Total gross investments spend                                                    | DKK /three.tf/five.tf/zero.tf bn | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n| Average return on capital employed (ROCE)                                        | /one.tf/one.tf-/one.tf/two.tf %  | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n| Average share of EBITDA from long-term regulated  and contracted activities      | ~/nine.tf/zero.tf %              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n| Average yearly increase in EBITDA from offshore  and onshore assets in operation | ~/one.tf/two.tf %                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n\n## Financial policies\n\nRating\n\nMin.

Therefore, we have set the strategic aspiration to become the world's leading green energy major by 2030. This entails that we will be one of the largest green electricity producers in the world. We also aspire to become a future global leader in renewable hydrogen and green fuels since we believe these technologies will be important contributors to a fully decarbonised energy system and are natural extensions of our renewable energy platform. Furthermore, we aim to be\n\none of the world's largest and most valuecreating deployers of capital to the green transformation. While doing this, we aspire to be recognised as a global sustainability leader and as being the world's leading talent platform in renewable energy.\n\n## Validating our ambitions on sciencebased climate action\n\nIt is easy to commit to a net-zero target, but less so to show a credible path towards it. Therefore, we are proud to be the first and so far only energy company in the world to have our 2040 net-zero commitment (scope 1-3) validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as one of only seven companies globally. The validation entails that our carbon reduction targets are consistent with the reductions required by energy companies to keep global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nWe are fully on track to become carbonneutral in our operations (scope 1-2) by 2025, and we are making good progress in our supply chain decarbonisation programme, which is aimed at driving the decarbonisation of our supply chain to reach our goal of netzero emissions in our entire carbon footprint (scope 1-3) by 2040.\n\n## Reporting on SDGs, TCFD, and the EU taxonomy\n\nAcross our various reports, we report on how we are advancing the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the risks and opportunities climate change can have on our business (TCFD), our greenhouse gas emissions, and the extent to which our business activities are defined as sustainable according to the EU taxonomy.\n\nAs a renewable energy company, we aspire to have a transformative impact on SDGs 7 - Affordable & Clean Energy and 13 - Climate Action, while contributing to several others. We report on our SDG contributions and impacts and on all our 19 sustainability programmes in our sustainability report, orsted.com/sustainability2021. In addition, we present our sustainability priorities on page 29.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur TCFD disclosure is integrated throughout the strategy, risk, and governance sections of this annual report, and in our ESG performance report, we include a one-page overview with references to our TCFD alignment: orsted.com/ ESGperformance2021\n\nOur full greenhouse gas emissions and EU taxonomy reporting is also included in our ESG performance report.\n\nOur full ESG data overview (including EU taxonomy) and our accounting policies are available in our annual ESG performance report, which together with the sustainability report constitute our annual Communication on Progress to the UN Global Compact and comply with the requirements for corporate social responsibility reporting set out in section 99a of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as section 99b on gender distribution and section 107d on diversity at management levels.",

This will bring us significant growth opportunities across all our business areas.\n\nThe main solution to decarbonise the global energy system will be green electrification. Forecasts indicate that electricity volumes will grow three-fold towards 2050, and that 90 % of the electricity supply in 2050 will be from renewables (IEA). To support this profound electrification of society, a massive build-out of renewable energy is needed: To meet the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario, the global installed renewable capacity including hydroelectric, geothermal, and marine energy will need to grow from the current 2,500 GW to around 28,000 GW in 2050 (IRENA). In the next decade alone, the installed capacity of renewable energy is expected to triple.\n\nThe large-scale renewable build-out needed to support the green electrification will be based on increasingly larger renewable energy projects, which also requires a significant scale-up of the transmission infrastructure, both onshore and offshore. To support the significant build-out of offshore wind, we expect to see new types of cross-national renewable hybrid transmission infrastructures and energy islands which will be linked to several markets through interconnectors. Such new types of transmission infrastructure will enable significant cost savings and a more efficient use of the energy produced across markets.\n\nIn addition to massive green electrification, an important driver of global decarbonisation will be renewable hydrogen and green fuels, which will become the main decarbonisation route for heavy industry and hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, refineries, and ammonia, where direct electrification is not possible. When renewable hydrogen is processed further into green fuels, it is expected to be the key instrument in decarbonising heavy transport such as heavy trucking, shipping, and aviation.

In the long term, such capacity will need to grow massively to achieve global net-zero emissions across the energy system: Industry forecasts indicate 3,500-5,000 GW of electrolyser capacity needed by 2050 (IEA, IRENA).\n\n## Building a multi-technology growth platform to meet customer needs\n\nThe accelerating transformation towards a global energy system based on renewables is driving the need for \u00d8rsted to broaden our technology platform to remain competitive in the future global energy market.\n\nFirst, customer demand for renewable energy is driven mainly by the need for certain volumes and load profiles in specific markets where corporates operate, and not so much by a specific power production technology. This is also true for companies from hard-to-abate sectors now wanting to procure renewable\n\nhydrogen and green fuels to decarbonise their operations. Energy developers with a multi-technology platform are better able to provide corporate customers with the energy they need at any point in time to effectively run their businesses.\n\nSecondly, multi-technology energy solutions enable companies to combine various energy assets with complementary load profiles, hence granting steadier green electricity production profiles to the market and to individual customers than single-technology alternatives.\n\nFinally, the scale achieved through a multitechnology platform in a global market drives cost reductions and portfolio synergies, when it comes to both pipeline development, engineering, procurement, construction, and operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHornsea 1, off the Yorkshire coast, the UK.",

        "page_content": "## Our strategic aspiration and growth platform\n\nAt our Capital Markets Day in June 2021, we presented our strategic aspiration to become the world's leading green energy major. To achieve this aspiration, we are making bold choices across our multi-technology growth platform, while continuously sharpening our competitive edge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our strategic aspiration\n\nBased on our view of how the energy system will develop and the significant market opportunities ahead, we have set a new 2030 strategic aspiration.\n\nOur new aspiration is to become the world's leading green energy major by 2030. This entails reaching a leading position across a set of important dimensions.\n\nThe first dimension is our ambition for green energy build-out, where we aim to be one of the largest green electricity producers. We have therefore increased our ambition for installed gross renewable capacity from +30 GW to ~50 GW by 2030, almost quadrupling our current gross installed base of 13.0 GW. In offshore wind, we aim to maintain our undisputed position as the global no. 1 with a target of 30 GW. Within onshore renewables (onshore wind, solar PV, and storage), we aim to become a global top 10 player and reach 17.5 GW of installed capacity. While we may not become the largest renewable energy\n\ncompany measured in gigawatts, we aim to be one of the world's largest green electricity producers by 2030, supported by the high load factors of the technologies we operate. We also aspire to become a global leader in renewable hydrogen and green fuels since we believe these technologies will be important contributors to a fully decarbonised energy system and are natural extensions of our renewable energy platform.\n\nInstalled capacity GW\n\n\u00d74\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "To deliver on our build-out ambition, we will need to deploy vast amounts of capital. Therefore, the second key component in our 2030 aspiration is to be one of the world's largest and most value-creating deployers of capital to the green transformation, maintaining our financial discipline, and remaining a trustworthy partner to our equity investors and other capital providers.\n\nThe third key dimension in our aspiration is talent. At \u00d8rsted, we deeply believe that talent is diverse by nature, which is why we want to foster an inclusive culture that embraces diversity of thought, experience, and personal backgrounds that will enable us to better solve challenges and deliver on our vision. Towards 2030, we have set the bold aspiration to become the world's leading talent platform in the renewable energy industry.\n\nThe fourth dimension of our aspiration is sustainability leadership, which is at the core of what we do. Having been named the most sustainable energy company in the world for now four years in a row, we want to continue and accelerate our effort: We aspire to be a globally recognised sustainability leader, to make the world more sustainable, and to demonstrate that sustainability and value creation are not opposing, but rather mutually reinforcing objectives.\n\nFinally, we want to be a core contributor and catalyst for the change required to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. We will continue to take a leading role in the green energy transformation and to lead by example, by setting ambitious targets and by engaging with key stakeholders across sectors and countries.\n\n## Our growth platform\n\nGiven our new 2030 aspiration, we want to expand and globalise our growth platform, while maintaining our strategic focus as an upstream renewable energy company, since we believe this is how we can create the most value.\n\nWe are making a set of key strategic choices with both short- and long-term potential across our growth platform.\n\nIn offshore wind, we have increased our ambition from 15 GW gross capacity in 2025 to 30 GW in 2030. To achieve this ambition, we are acting along various complementary strategic avenues. We will further expand our market footprint in high-opportunity markets such as the Baltics, the Nordic countries, Asian markets such as Korea, Vietnam, and Japan, and other growth regions. Furthermore, we aim to build a strong role in driving the commercialisation of floating offshore wind to unlock its large potential. By undertaking these steps, we are confident we can increase our annual build-out from 2 GW per year towards 2025 to 3 GW per year towards 2030.\n\nIn onshore renewables, we have built a strong multi-technological platform in the US since our acquisition of Lincoln Clean Energy in 2018. We plan to reach our ambition of 17.5 GW gross installed capacity by 2030 by acting along four main avenues. Firstly, we will strive to increase our gross annual build-out to 1.5 GW from an average of 0.8 GW between 2018 and 2021. Secondly, we will gradually shift our project portfolio towards more solar PV capacity, given the increased customer\n\n## 2030 a/s.ss01pi/r.ss01a/t.ss01ion\n\nBecome the world's leading green energy major\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne of the world's largest green electricity producers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal no. 1\n\nin offshore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA global leader in renewable H/two.osf & green fuels\n\nOne of the world's largest and most value-creating deployers of capital into the green transformation\n\nThe world's leading talent platform in renewable energy\n\nA globally recognised sustainability leader\n\nA core contributor and catalyst for change towards a world running entirely on green energy\n\n## Our growth platform\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Europe                |                          | Global leader North America   | APAC   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|\n| New growth   platform | Strong growth   platform | Identify   opportunities      |        |\n| New growth   platform |                          | Identify   opportunities      |        |",

Thirdly, we will continue to expand our onshore position in Europe after the acquisition of Brookfield Renewable Ireland in June 2021. Lastly, while the development of own projects will remain our focus area, we will continue to pursue growth along additional paths, such as asset and platform acquisitions.\n\nThe most recent component of our global platform is renewable hydrogen and green fuels, which we believe will have enormous potential in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors. Based on the evident synergies with our upstream renewable portfolio, we are\n\nconfident we can become a global leader in this space as well, building on our extensive experience with scaling up and driving down costs of renewable energy technologies, our strong knowledge about and position in the energy system with access to large-scale renewable power, our proven partnership approach, and strong offtaker relationships. Our strategic value chain focus will be on the parts where we believe we can add the most value in close collaboration with key offtake partners. Consequently, we could see ourselves taking a more prominent role in liquid fuel processing of products, such as e-ammonia and e-methanol, if we see a clear potential for value creation.\n\n## Our competitive edge\n\nCompetition in the renewable energy industry is intensifying, driven by the increasing market opportunities. New players are entering the market, not least the oil majors which are increasingly setting high targets for their buildout of renewable energy.\n\nAmidst the increasing competition, we have been able to expand our market position. In offshore wind, we managed to secure 25-30 % of capacity awarded totally across all auctions and tenders between 2017 and 2021. In 2021, we added 4.5 GW of new awarded capacity. It is a key strategic focus for our company to continue strengthening our competitive differentiation along five key dimensions.\n\n## Market shaping\n\nCollaborating closely with policy makers and regulators to establish the conditions needed to develop renewable energy assets is an integral part of our way of operating as a global company and a key competitive asset, which we will continue to strengthen. Areas like local market development, investment in upskilling, and protection of biodiversity are not just slogans to us, and we are truly committed to continue being a 'trusted advisor' to policymakers and states to both develop regulatory frameworks for the renewable energy sector and maximise the local positive impact of our renewable energy projects.\n\n## Proven operating model\n\nSince our entry in the offshore wind space, we have been able to effectively scale our presence in the market and turn it into a competitive advantage. In offshore wind, we are the\n\ncompany in the world that has constructed the most capacity with 28 offshore wind farms in operation. We have been able to scale up our asset base, to increase project scale, and to continuously develop novel solutions. This longstanding industry experience has enhanced our problem-solving ability, enabling us to act fast when problems are on the rise, and thus to execute our projects on time and budget. While we have increasingly globalised our platform, we have established a well-functioning operating model that allows us to effectively harvest synergies and efficiencies across markets and technologies, while managing the increasing operational complexity. As we further grow and diversify our market presence towards 2030, we will continue to sharpen our operating model to be able to fulfil our full organisational and operational potential and to remain a credible company that delivers on its promises.\n\n## Supplier partnership model\n\nAnother vital component of our competitive edge is our first-class supplier collaboration model. We can indeed count on strong supplier partnership relations across our entire portfolio, which enable us to maximise our joint strengths in the specific locations to effectively meet customer demands. As examples of this, our trusted collaboration with the turbine supplier GE has enabled us to contract turbines for over 4 GW onshore capacity in the last eight years, while our cross-technology partnership with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) is contributing to our Greater Changhua 1 & 2a, Hornsea 2, and Haystack projects reaching COD and to progressing construction on the Gode Wind 3 and Borkum Riffgrund 3 offshore projects.",

        "page_content": "Looking more broadly at our supply chain, our partnership in the US with the monopile supplier EEW will be key in providing us with the monopiles to mature the construction of our wind farms Ocean Wind 1 and 2, while the collaboration with Dominion Energy for the first-ever Jones Act compliant wind turbine generator (WTG) vessel is a key step to establishing a local supply chain for US offshore wind. The above-mentioned partnerships are just few examples of the successful partnerships matured so far. Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen our supplier portfolio to acquire the know-how needed to continue delivering strong winning bids, to successfully execute on our project pipeline, and to identify new opportunities together.\n\nBesides this, we are committed to working with our suppliers to minimise the environmental impact of our entire supply chain: We will do so by implementing our supply chain decarbonisation programme and by meticulously tracking our green performance towards our science-based targets.\n\n## Talent\n\nHaving a strong talent platform is of paramount importance for us. Our employees are vital to our transformation journey, and we want to continue attracting and developing the best talent to support our growth journey. In Denmark, we have ranked 4th, 5th, and 6th most attractive employer, respectively, among engineering and natural science, business and finance, and IT professionals. We are also building strong talent platforms in new markets: As an example, we are proud of having received the Best Employer Brand in Malaysia. Looking towards 2030, we cannot stand still: We have set the bold ambition of becoming the world's leading talent platform towards 2030, to maintain talent at the core of our competitive advantage, and to effectively support our ambitious transformation journey.\n\n## Innovation and digitalisation\n\nDriving technological innovation and exploring new digital opportunities is a key competence for us. We have a strong culture of innovation that allows us to continue being at the forefront of technological and digital industry advancements as well as to constantly simplify and optimise our internal processes. One key example of our ongoing innovation is the use of load factor modelling in wind farms, where our wind specialists apply automation and data mining techniques to constantly improve the monitoring and prediction of wind farm production as well as to provide insights useful in deciding which turbine layout to use, or where to best locate the next wind farm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlum Creek, Wayne County, Texas, the US.",

As shown in the graph to the right, the DKK ~450 billion will be funded both by \u00d8rsted (DKK ~350 billion), by reinvesting operational earnings, issuing new senior debt and hybrid capital, and reinvesting farm-down proceeds, and by our joint ventures and EPC partners (DKK ~100 billion). While the DKK 350 billion gross investments serve to reach our 11-12 % ROCE target, the DKK 200 billion net investments will contribute to our 12 % EBTIDA CAGR over the period between 2020 and 2027.\n\nOf the DKK 350 billion, we will invest ~80 % in offshore wind, renewable hydrogen and green fuels and dedicate the remaining ~20 % to grow our onshore renewable activities.\n\nWe will continue to invest our capital according to the following principles, in order of priority:\n\n- 1. We will maintain our strong commitment to our credit ratings (BBB+/Baa1).\n- 2.   We will honour our dividend commitment to our shareholders.\n- 3.   We will invest in value-creating growth opportunities.\n\nWe adopt a balance sheet funding model, which reduces financing costs and enhances scalability and flexibility in our capital allocation. Our portfolio approach allows us to distribute project risks across multiple projects, thereby reducing the cost of capital compared to a single-asset model (project financing).\n\nIn 2021, we invested DKK 39 billion, of which our offshore and onshore activities accounted for 60 % and 40 %, respectively. The investments in Onshore was higher than the target in 2021 due to the acquisition of Brookfield Renewable Ireland and the late-stage Lincoln Land project.\n\nAt the end of 2021, our total outstanding debt, excluding hybrids, amounted to DKK 51.0 billion, with more than 39 % issued in a green format.\n\n## Funding composition of green growth investments\n\nGross investments 2020-2027 (DKKbn)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our sustainability priorities\n\nWe are in the middle of an immense global energy transformation, and this transformation needs to be a force for good. We want to lead the way to a future fuelled by green energy, where nature, society, and people flourish.\n\nOnce a year, we perform a sustainability themes analysis to map and prioritise the themes most important to our business and stakeholders.\n\nBased on this analysis, we have updated our sustainability priorities and approach built around four core challenges related to climate, nature, people, and corporate governance. In the following, we will elaborate on the core challenges of each pillar of our priorities.\n\n## Science-aligned climate action\n\nLimiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C will require a transformation of the global energy system. We continue to have high ambitions for our climate action, and we are proud to have worked with the Science Based Targets initiative to become the first energy company in the world to have our net-zero target for 2040 SBTi approved. We continue our commitment to reach our goal of net-zero emissions in our entire carbon footprint (scope 1-3) by 2040.\n\n## Green energy in balance with nature\n\nThe consequences of climate change are negatively impacting our ecosystems, and we are seeing water scarcity, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss all around the globe. We cannot solve the climate crisis at the expense of nature.\n\nAs an industry, we must therefore ensure that the global energy transformation takes place in a sustainable way. The transformation will require a greater emphasis on best practices within project design and responsible resource management to reduce the impacts of infrastructure operations on ecosystems.\n\nFor this reason, we have set the ambition to deliver a net-positive biodiversity impact in all new renewable energy projects from 2030 at the latest. This entails that the project should have an overall positive biodiversity impact through active measures taken to avoid, mitigate, or offset potential biodiversity losses.\n\nWith our new biodiversity ambition, there will be new challenges for us to solve, and we will systematically implement initiatives that ensure an overall net-positive contribution to natural ecosystems, habitats, and species across our future renewable energy projects.\n\n## A green transformation that works for people\n\nBeyond lowering carbon emissions by developing and deploying new green technologies, global climate action should also work for people.\n\nWe have sustainability programmes in place that are specifically focused on the people aspects of the green transformation. Our safety standards are well-developed and a key priority for us. Our employees' health and well-being are main focus areas for us, and we have a clear code of conduct and due diligence processes in place to ensure human rights are respected across our supply chain.\n\nInclusion of diversity is another important area for us. In 2021, we have made considerable progress on our ambition to foster diverse talent and an even more inclusive company culture. As an example, we further matured our global inclusion networks, which now count more than 1,000 active participants and have a network in each one of our regions, supported by senior leaders.\n\nIn addition, we have set new targets for gender equality and are aiming for at least 40 % of our total workforce to be women by 2030, including at our leadership levels.\n\nWithin this framework, we are committed to creating green jobs and in this way be part of transforming and future-proofing the workforce. To achieve this, we are partnering with labour unions, retraining the workforce, and creating new, well-paid jobs.\n\n## A governance that enables the right decisions\n\nAs a business, we want to incorporate sustainability leadership into our entire way of working and thus also into our internal governance.\n\nTherefore, we are strengthening the remuneration structure for our Executive Committee to ensure a stronger and more systematic integration of ESG. Our new short-term incentive scheme, effective from 2022, is designed to support that we deliver on our core sustainability commitments, improve our sustainability leadership performance, and continue to push new frontiers.\n\n## Ban on blades to landfill\n\nIn the coming decade, wind turbines will be deployed at an unprecedented pace, delivering renewable energy to industries and to millions of people, making it even more important to decommission the blades in a sustainable way.\n\nAs part of our company strategy towards carbon neutrality, we have made a new commitment to either reuse, recycle, or recover all the wind turbine blades in our global portfolio upon decommissioning. Thus, establishing an immediate ban on the landfilling of our blades.",

        "page_content": "## Our risks and risk management\n\nRisks are a natural and integral part of our business activities, and our risk profile changes continuously. We aim to mitigate our risks and reduce them to an acceptable level through risk management.\n\nBesides business risks (incl. financial risks), we are exposed to risks in connection with legal compliance, climate change, and ESG and sustainability in general, both at a strategic and operational level. The purpose of our risk management is to identify and quantify our risks and decide how best to manage and mitigate them. We assess the extent to which individual risks are acceptable or perhaps even desirable as well as the extent to which these risks can be reduced to ensure an optimum balance between risk and return.\n\nA large part of our earnings is generated from offshore wind, with the UK and Continental Europe being the key contributors. However, with our expansions into the US and Asia Pacific and into onshore wind, solar PV, and hydrogen, our future earnings will be spread across more geographical regions and technologies. Therefore, political and other macroeconomic factors play an important\n\nrole in our risk management. When we invest in new assets and activities or divest assets, the consolidated risks associated with our portfolio change. Therefore, we assess the impact of a given decision on the portfolio upfront.\n\nWe work systematically with risks. All business units and selected staff functions identify and prioritise business risks. An assessment is made of the potential financial impact of individual risks, and whether they are of a short-term (0-2 years), a medium-term (2-5 years), a longterm (5+ years), or a recurring nature. All our risks are then consolidated and evaluated at Group level. The ultimate responsibility for all the individual risks rests with a member of the Executive Committee.\n\nThe top six business risks identified during 2021 are shown to the right where they are illustrated based on their potential impact (post-risk\n\n## Top 6 business risks\n\nEffect on our value and credit metric\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact on FFO/adjusted net debt\n\nue\n\nal\n\nImpact on v\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQuantification of risks is based on a scenario where the risk occurs with 10 % probability (P90).

You can read more about these risks on the following pages.\n\nWe have similar processes in place for identifying and prioritising risks related to ESG and sustainability as well as legal compliance. However, as these are assessed using different parameters, we do not show them in a consolidated picture together with the business risks. A description of the most significant ESG and sustainability risks can be found in our sustainability report here.\n\nIn addition to our ordinary business risks, we are exposed to risks which have a very small probability of occurring, but which could potentially impact our finances and/or reputation substantially. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- -  fatal injuries\n- -   strong hurricanes, typhoons, hailstorms, arctic blasts, or earthquakes, especially in Taiwan, which may lead to the partial loss of offshore and onshore wind farms, solar PV farms, and storage assets\n- -   broken pipes at the Nybro Gas Treatment Plant in Denmark which may lead to personal injury and damage to the environment\n- -   breakdowns at power plants that may lead to personal injury and partial loss of assets.\n\nAfter risk-reducing measures are implemented, the Executive Committee assesses whether the level of each risk is appropriate, or if it is\n\nhigher than the desired level. If the risk level is still too high, further risk reducing measures are initiated to the extent possible.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nClimate change presents financial risk to the global economy. To mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is important to understand the risks and opportunities presented by rising temperatures, climate-related policies, and emerging technologies in our changing world.\n\nAs climate-related risks and opportunities are directly linked to our green vision and strategy, we address them as an integral part of our daily business, and we report on them as recommended by the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Read more about our climate-related risks on page 34.\n\nAs part of our process towards EU taxonomy alignment, we have also evaluated the resilience of our taxonomy-eligible assets in changing and extreme weather, thus building on our TCFD climate scenario analysis completed for the offshore business in 2019. We did this by assessing our assets' exposure to the taxonomy's list of 28 climate change hazards during their lifetime and identifying the processes in place to mitigate the risks. We assessed indicators for a worst-case climate change scenario as defined by the latest IPCC report. The analysis confirmed that our assets are resilient and can withstand projected climate changes during their lifetime. In 2022, we will review the analysis to ensure our approach to documenting asset resilience aligns with upcoming EU guidance.\n\n## Development in risks in 2021\n\nThis year, 'Cost inflation and supply chains' together with 'Offshore power generation' have been elevated into our top six business risks (expanded from five in 2020). This means that 'US offshore development and construction risk' has been excluded as a top business risks.\n\nIn 2021, we saw increasing and more volatile prices for steel and copper. The high cost inflation and volatility experienced during the year could have an adverse effect on our earnings as well as our suppliers' financial position and ability to deliver as agreed, if not mitigated. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted some of our supply chains' ability to deliver on time due to local restrictions and has led to an overall higher corporate default rate in Europe. Therefore, 'Cost inflation and supply chains' enter our top six risks as our third largest risk.\n\nIt has become increasingly important to limit the uncertainty around our offshore power generation estimates, arising from variability in wind speeds as well as blockage and wake effects. Therefore, we have introduced 'Offshore power generation' as the fifth largest risk this year.\n\n'Inflation and interest rates' remain our most significant business risk. During the second half of 2021, we have seen increasing interest rates globally, and we expect this could lead to rate hikes in 2022 in the US and the UK.\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we experienced skyrocketing prices and a high volatility in the\n\ngas and power markets where we operate. Therefore, currencies and energy prices remain in our top six risks, but is now deemed our fourth largest risk.\n\nMajor cyberattacks are becoming still more frequent, and we continue to see an increasing number of cybercriminals looking to financially harm companies. Therefore, cybersecurity remains in our top six risks, but is now deemed our sixth largest risk.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nFrom the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, \u00d8rsted has handled it as a corporate crisis, and, consequently, the Corporate Crisis Management Organisation (CCMO) has provided strategic guidance and support to our regional and operational COVID-19 task forces. A global COVID-19 standard operation procedure, a testing strategy, a global vaccination policy, and relevant business continuity plans have also been developed or updated.\n\nDuring the year, we have seen some adverse impacts of the pandemic, mainly related to our supply chain and the power prices in the markets where we operate. While COVID-19-related lockdowns among our suppliers had some adverse impact on the construction timeline for some of our projects, we expect these delays to only result in a limited overall impact on the project economics.",

        "page_content": "## /one.tf. Inflation and interest rates\n\n## Description\n\nTo a large extent, our medium- to long-term earnings can be expected to follow the development in consumer and market prices, thereby protecting the real value of our assets and equity. However, fixed nominal subsidies from wind assets in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the US (the US contracts are indexed with a fixed annual escalator) are exceptions to this. Fixed-price power purchase agreements (PPAs) from assets in the US and Taiwan as well as fixed nominal cash flows related to debt are also exceptions to this. We are exposed to inflation risks in these markets, where an increase in inflation will adversely impact the expected real value of the revenue.\n\nOur farm-down model of funding future wind farms through divestments is exposed to interest rate risks as wind assets are more attractive to buyers when interest rates are low compared to other financial assets with similar risk profiles.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in interest rates and inflation may adversely impact our earnings and farm-down model, thereby affecting the value of our assets.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nOur inflation and interest rate exposures are managed by matching assets and liabilities in the same currency and with similar payment structures. Hence, our European fixed nominal subsidies are being offset by EUR-denominated fixed-rate debt. In contrast, we have entered into inflation swaps for part of our inflation-indexed revenue in the UK to match our nominal GBP debt. The risks that arise from projects in Taiwan and the US can be reduced by obtaining matching-duration fixed-rate debt denominated in the same currency as the revenue.\n\nRead more about inflation and interest rate risks in note 6.4.\n\n## /two.tf.  Increased competition leading to price pressure\n\n## Description\n\nAs the offshore industry has become more mature and increasingly global, competition has increased with new market players entering. We expect a diversified competitive landscape going forward, including oil majors, utilities, institutional investors, and regional developers.\n\nIn offshore wind, the competitive auction and tender mechanics being implemented across the various regions and markets are also becoming more diversified. While the mature European markets increasingly look to include innovation and system integration (e.g. storage and renewable hydrogen) to play an increasingly important role in auctions and tenders, developing markets in both Europe, the US, and Asia Pacific often emphasise costs and job creation as determination criteria. For offshore wind, this necessitates a flexible approach to remain competitive across the different markets and implies the need to retain a strong supplier engagement and be cost-efficient.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nThere is a risk that we will not win the targeted capacity in the auctions and tenders in which we participate, or that our value creation from the projects we win ends up being lower than targeted.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe will continue to utilise portfolio-scale advantages and knowhow gained from previously executed projects to develop supply chain solutions and reduce costs and risks in order to maximise our ability to win future projects. Furthermore, we are making early commitments and entering into both global and regional framework agreements to secure capacity. Finally, we are differentiating through active stakeholder management, investments in upskilling and creation of local jobs, and by focusing on sustainable solutions, including through protection of biodiversity of our renewable energy projects.\n\n## 3.  Cost inflation and supply chains\n\n## Description\n\nAs a global renewable energy developer, we are exposed to risks related to cost inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, performance of new suppliers, suppliers' financial positions, and consequences of COVID-19.\n\nAmong other things, we are exposed to the highly volatile steel and copper prices, which are influenced by high global demand with widespread application in various sectors. As the industry grows with continuously new technological developments, we are exposed to potential bottlenecks in parts of the supply chain if there are only a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting the future demands. Therefore, it is important that new suppliers enter and stay in the market. We are also exposed to counterparty risks if one of our suppliers should default or deliver unsatisfactory products.\n\nFurthermore, COVID-19 developments could potentially impact the supply chain's ability to deliver in a timely manner due to restrictions on movement, shutdown of facilities, delays, etc.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nDisruptions in the supply chain or sudden inflation in key materials could result in project delays and budget overruns.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nTo combat cost inflation, we have implemented a hedging programme for steel and other commodities, which will be rolled out to our asset projects. Furthermore, we enter into volume agreements and source wind turbines from key suppliers in a timely manner to reduce uncertainty.\n\nOur process for vetting new suppliers is thorough, and we have strict credit risk policies in place to manage credit and counterparty risks.\n\n## 4. Currencies and energy prices\n\n## Description\n\nOur main currency exposure relates to GBP, followed by USD and NTD due to our investments in renewable energy in the UK, the US, and Taiwan.\n\nWe are primarily exposed to power price risks from the sale of our renewable power generation in the US, the UK, and Denmark. Power generation from our CHP plants are exposed to both power and fuel prices.\n\nOur exposure to gas and oil prices is limited, but we still have some exposure to oil-indexed gas sourcing contracts and from selling gas at fixed prices.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFluctuations in exchange rates and energy prices may adversely impact our earnings.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe hedge currencies and energy prices for up to five years and in some cases longer. As an alternative to hedging power, we seek to enter into long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs), under which we sell power from our renewable assets to reduce cash flow fluctuations. We hedge more of the risk in the first years and less in the later years. This is due to decreasing market liquidity and increasing uncertainty about generated volumes.\n\nRead more about currency and energy price risks in notes 6.2 and 6.3.",

        "page_content": "## 5.  Offshore power generation\n\n## Description\n\nOffshore power generation is exposed to risks related to wind speeds and directions, power curves, blockage and wake effects, and geographic regions.\n\nWind speeds and directions have a significant impact on our earnings and are characterised by a high degree of variability between years. Estimates are therefore based on onsite pre-construction measurements and historic data, and variability must be taken into account before making investment decisions.\n\nWind speeds decrease as they approach a wind turbine (blockage), and after they pass it (wake). Both effects exist at the level of individual wind turbines, the wind farm as a whole, and from neighbouring wind farms.\n\nFurthermore, wind speeds and directions tend to be correlated in geographic regions. As our portfolio of offshore wind farms currently is Eurocentric, we are especially exposed to the wind climate in Europe.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to correctly estimate lifetime average wind speeds, blockage and wake effects, and thus generation could lead to bids or financial investment decisions based on inaccurate business cases.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWith extensive experience in the offshore wind industry, we have been a first mover in creating global blockage modelling, and we have developed a refined method of horizontal extrapolation of wind speeds to specific wind turbine positions. In addition, we have done extensive research and developed new wake models that capture the influence of turbulence.\n\nTo ensure correct wind speed estimates, we have established a practice for development projects ensuring 24 months of onsite wind measurements prior to bids.\n\n## 6. Cybersecurity\n\n## Description\n\nCyber risk is the combination of two key parameters: intention and capability. We assess cybersecurity risk by the protection level of our systems and processes, mapping likely threat actors, their intentions and capabilities, and what the financial impact on us would be.\n\nIn recent years, several major cyberattacks have been launched against companies around the world, and we see an increase in attacks where ransomware and financial gain is the key driver behind cyberattacks.\n\nAs a global major within renewable energy, we are exposed to several different cyberattack threats: ransomware attacks, data exfiltration attacks, cyber-physical impact attacks, and more.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nMinor digital risk events, such as viruses and attempted break-ins, are everyday risks without significant impact. However, major cyberattacks or events may impact all or part of our assets or, in the event of a ransomware attack, have an impact on our financial position.\n\n## Mitigation initiatives\n\nWe face different types of cyber risks. Some are related to our assets and some to our systems. Thus, we mitigate cyber risks with several different initiatives, which are continuously assessed and prioritised based on our strategic cybersecurity risk assessment with the aim of lowering our risk exposure.\n\nAt our operating assets, we have deployed production cyber defences to enhance protection against onsite and offsite attacks. In addition, we have a top-level 'Information and cybersecurity policy' supported by our global governance model, we have regular trainings, and we participate in fora on information and experience sharing.\n\nThis way, our cyber capability is continuously improved in order to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover across the enterprise and production sites.\n\n## Legal compliance\n\n## Description\n\nRisks associated with legal compliance are assessed based on financial and reputational significance and probability. Our most significant risks are 1) tax law, 2) offshore grid code compliance, and 3) financial regulation. (1) We operate in tax regimes with different tax rules and rates, and our tax affairs span over corporate tax compliance, transfer pricing, and indirect taxes. (2) In every country where we operate, we have to meet certain grid code requirements set by the transmission system operator (TSO) to be allowed to generate and supply electricity to the grid. (3) We are subject to several financial regulations, such as REMIT, MAR, EMIR, Dodd Frank, MiFID, SFTR, and AML1. The financial regulations are relevant for a large part of our activities.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to comply with the above-mentioned rules and regulations may result in severe legal sanctions, such as imprisonment, fines, and damage claims, but also in possible disconnection from the grid or loss of generation license.\n\n## Mitigating initiatives\n\n(1) We have implemented a comprehensive tax control framework and mandatory compliance, including transfer pricing documentation, in line with OECD recommendations and local requirements. This has been prepared on a contemporary basis to mitigate our tax risks. (2) We have implemented grid code governance to provide clear responsibility, and we have a 'compliance critical systems' project underway to help our sites identify what systems are critical and ensure suitable measures for reliability. (3) We have implemented comprehensive policies, procedures, training, and controls for relevant parts of our business to ensure compliance with financial regulations.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nDescription\n\nChanges in the world's climate constitute a risk and an opportunity for us. In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that it is unequivocal that human activity causes global warming, and that we are on course to reach the critical point of 1.5 \u00b0C of warming already in the early 2030s.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nFailure to adhere to the 1.5 \u00b0C limit may cause severe changes in the worlds' climate and make catastrophic events more severe and frequent. This could not only have an adverse effect on our planet, but on our operating assets as well.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations set out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we seek to exploit climate-related opportunities and be a part of the solution through development and generation of renewable energy.\n\nAt the same time, we seek to reduce the risks related to climate change by encouraging regulators and public authorities to set ambitious renewable energy targets, improving the competitiveness of green technologies, assessing acute and chronic weather development, and taking extreme weather conditions and events into account when designing and building our assets.\n\nFurthermore, we take climate-related risks and opportunities into account when we prepare business cases for investment in new assets or activities. By doing this, we seek to avoid ending up with stranded assets or assets and activities with a significantly lower value than originally expected.",

        "page_content": "## Results\n\n## Financial results\n\n## Revenue\n\nPower generation from wind and solar assets increased by 6 % and totalled 22.2 TWh in 2021. Ramp-up of generation from Borssele 1 & 2, Sage Draw, Plum Creek, Willow Creek, Western Trail, Muscle Shoals, Permian Energy Center, and acquired onshore assets was partly offset by significantly lower wind speeds across our portfolio.\n\nThermal power generation increased by 55 % and amounted to 6.9 TWh, driven by favourable market conditions for power generation as well as increased demand for ancillary services. Heat generation amounted to 7.9 TWh, up 19 % compared to last year, mainly due to colder weather.\n\nOur renewable share of generation was 90 % in 2021, in line with last year, as the lower wind share was offset by a larger part of the thermal generation being biomass-based.\n\nRevenue amounted to DKK 77.7 billion. The increase of 48 % relative to 2020 was primarily due to the significantly higher gas and power prices across all markets, especially during H2 2021, and the divestment of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 1 in 2021. This was partly offset by low wind speeds in 2021 and the 2020 divestments of the LNG activities and the Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses (RBC).\n\n## EBITDA\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA) totalled DKK 24.3 billion, of which the gain from the 50 % farmdowns of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1\n\namounted to DKK 8.5 billion. Thus, EBITDA excluding new partnerships amounted to DKK 15.8 billion, a decrease of DKK 2.3 billion compared to last year, in line with our expectations.\n\nWhile we did expect a decline in EBITDA (excluding new partnerships) at the beginning of the year, the composition turned out differently than anticipated, driven by very strong performance by our CHP plants and gas business, whereas low wind speeds and the energy crunch led to a larger than expected negative impact on our offshore wind assets. In addition, EBITDA was negatively impacted by provisions towards our partners in offshore wind farms.\n\nEarnings from wind and solar assets in operation amounted to DKK 15.0 billion, a decrease of DKK 2.0 billion compared to last\n\nyear. Ramp-up of generation combined with the addition of CFDs for the last 400 MW of capacity from Hornsea 1 and a positive effect from ceasing to use the business performance principle in 2021 (approx. DKK 1.0 billion) contributed positively to our site earnings. However, this was more than offset by significantly lower wind speeds across our offshore portfolio (approx. DKK 2.8 billion compared to last year), higher TNUoS tariffs following the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Walney Extension in mid-2020 and Hornsea 1 in Q1 2021, OPEX related to preparing Hornsea 2 and Greater Changhua 1 & 2a for commissioning, and Horns Rev 2 coming off subsidy in October 2020.\n\nIn addition to lower wind speeds and the effects guided at the beginning of the year, the last four months of the year was negatively impacted by\n\nEBITDA /e.ss01xclu/d.ss01ing n/e.ss01w pa/r.ss01/t.ss01n/e.ss01/r.ss01/s.ss01hip/s.ss01, DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2 OPEX\n\nof the year",

        "page_content": "the energy crunch with very high power prices and high volatility. This impacted our earnings through higher balancing and intermittency costs (approx. DKK 0.7 billion in total vs. 2020) and through costs related to buy back of hedges and overhedging due to low generation.\n\nThe low generation leading to over-hedging was caused by the very low wind speeds during 2021, while the buy-back of hedges related to 2022 was caused by the delayed ramp-up of Hornsea 2.\n\nEBITDA from partnerships amounted to DKK 7.5 billion and was primarily related to the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1 (new partnerships) of DKK 8.5 billion. Earnings from existing partnerships amounted to DKK -1.0 billion, a decrease of DKK 2.6 billion compared to last year, which saw high earnings related to the Hornsea 1\n\ntransmission asset. Furthermore, 2021 was negatively impacted by a DKK 0.8 billion warranty provision towards our partners related to cable protection system issues at some of our offshore wind farms and further wake provisions.\n\nEBITDA from our CHP plants amounted to DKK 3.2 billion, an increase of DKK 2.1 billion compared to last year. The increase was mainly due to higher realised power prices together with higher sales of ancillary services and higher heat and power generation. As we only hedge the power we co-generate with heat, we fully benefitted from the high power prices on our condensing power generation in the second half of the year.\n\nOur gas business contributed with earnings of DKK 1.8 billion in 2021, an increase of DKK 1.4 billion compared to last year. The positive effect was driven by the renegotiation of gas purchase\n\n| Financial /r.ss01/e.ss01/s.ss01ul/t.ss01/s.ss01,  DKKm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/uni00B9     | %                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Revenue                                                  | /seven.tf/seven.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /five.tf/two.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/one.tf     | /four.tf/eight.tf %   |\n| EBITDA                                                   | /two.tf/four.tf,/two.tf/nine.tf/six.tf       | /one.tf/eight.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/four.tf    | /three.tf/four.tf %   |\n| New partnerships                                         | /eight.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf          | -                                          | n.a.                  |\n| EBITDA excl. new partnerships                            | /one.tf/five.tf,/seven.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf   | /one.tf/eight.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/four.tf    | (/one.tf/three.tf %)  |\n| Depreciation, amortisation, and impairment               | (/eight.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf)           | (/seven.tf,/five.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf)     | /five.tf %            |\n| Operating profit (loss) (EBIT)                           | /one.tf/six.tf,/one.tf/nine.tf/five.tf       | /one.tf/zero.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/six.tf   | /five.tf/four.tf %    |\n| Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises                 | (/seven.tf/four.tf/two.tf)                   | /one.tf/zero.tf,/eight.tf/three.tf/one.tf  | n.a.                  |\n| Financial items, net                                     | (/two.tf,/one.tf/six.tf/six.tf)              | (/two.tf,/five.tf/two.tf/four.tf)          | (/one.tf/four.tf %)   |\n| Profit before tax                                        | /one.tf/three.tf,/two.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf   | /one.tf/eight.tf,/eight.tf/five.tf/zero.tf | (/three.tf/zero.tf %) |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year                        | (/two.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf)          | (/two.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf)          | /one.tf/three.tf %    |\n| Tax rate                                                 | /one.tf/eight.tf %                           | /one.tf/one.tf %                           | /seven.tf %p          |\n| Profit (loss) for the year                               | /one.tf/zero.tf,/eight.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf  | /one.tf/six.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/six.tf     | (/three.tf/five.tf %) |\n\n- 1 For 2020, business performance numbers are shown to form a better like-for-like comparison, in line with the comparison numbers used throughout the management's review, see note 1.5.\n\ncontracts and a strong underlying performance, especially in H2 2021, in a very volatile and bullish gas market, where we were able to optimise purchase from our long-term gas contracts. The divested RBC businesses contributed with DKK 0.9 billion to EBITDA in 2020.\n\n## EBIT\n\nEBIT increased by DKK 5.7 billion to DKK 16.2 billion in 2021, primarily as a result of the higher EBITDA, only partly offset by higher depreciation driven by more wind and solar assets in operation.\n\n## Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises\n\nIn 2021, gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises primarily concerned a DKK 0.8 billion increase in our indemnification provision towards INEOS regarding the divestment of our upstream oil and gas business unit in 2017. The provision is related to a transfer pricing case with the\n\n## EBITDA, %\n\n- Offshore\n- Onshore\n- Bioenergy & Other\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorwegian tax authorities. In 2020, we divested our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses to SEASNVE (now Andel), which resulted in a gain of DKK 10.9 billion in 2020.\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nNet financial income and expenses amounted to DKK -2.2 billion compared to DKK -2.5 billion in 2020. The lower net expenses were mainly due to losses on interest rate swaps in connection with the termination of local project financing and related swaps in the US in 2020 and a higher level of capitalised interests, partly offset by capital losses on the bond portfolio and higher return on tax equity due to more onshore assets in operation.\n\n## Tax and tax rate\n\nTax on profit for the year amounted to DKK 2.4 billion, DKK 0.3 billion higher than last year,\n\n## EBITDA, DKKbn\n\n- New partnerships\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, regulated and quasi-regulated activities and contracted activities accounted for 49 % and 41 % of our EBITDA,  respectively, whereas market-exposed activities accounted for 10 %.",

        "page_content": "mainly due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to initial tax equity contributions regarding our US onshore and offshore portfolio. The effective tax rate was 18 % and was significantly impacted by the tax-exempt gain of DKK 8.5 billion from the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1. Tax for 2021 was further reduced as we increased our deferred tax asset to reflect the increase of the UK tax rate from 19 % to 25 % from 2023 and by a reduction of our uncertain tax positions (UTP) due to updated management assessments.\n\n## Profit for the year\n\nProfit for the year totalled DKK 10.9 billion, DKK 5.8 billion lower than in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the DKK 10.9 billion gain from the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses in 2020, partly offset by the higher EBIT.\n\n## Cash flows and net debt\n\n## Cash flows from operating activities\n\nCash flows from operating activities totalled DKK 12.1 billion in 2021 compared to DKK 16.5 billion in 2020. The decrease of DKK 4.3 billion was mainly driven by higher spend to fill the gas storages, higher initial margin payments to clearing houses for conducting business due to the increased volatility in the gas and power markets, and higher net margin payments on unrealised hedges. This was partly offset by a cash inflow from work in progress in 2021 versus a cash outflow in 2020 and from higher tax equity contributions. Furthermore, the cash\n\nflows were positively impacted by higher net payables due to the high power prices.\n\nThe net margin payments (part of 'Change in derivatives') amounted to DKK -1.5 billion in 2021, but had opposite effects in Offshore (DKK -7.5 billion outflow related to power hedges) and Bioenergy & Other (DKK 6.0 billion inflow, primarily related to gas hedges in our end customer business activities). Initial margin payments to clearing houses (part of 'Change in trade receivables') were a cash outflow of DKK -7.3 billion with the largest part paid in Q4 2021.\n\nIn 2021, we had a net cash inflow from work in progress of DKK 4.5 billion, mainly from the divestment of the Hornsea 1 offshore transmission asset (DKK 5.0 billion), partly offset by construction work on the offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 2. In 2020, we had a net cash outflow of DKK 1.6 billion, mainly from supplier payments related to the construction of Hornsea 1 for partners and the offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 2, partly offset by the divestment of the offshore transmission asset at Walney Extension.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 39.3 billion against DKK 27.0 billion in 2020. The main investments in 2021 were:\n\n- -   offshore wind farms (DKK 23.4 billion), including Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan, Hornsea 2 in the UK, our portfolio of US projects, and payments related to Baltica 2 & 3 in Poland through the 50/50 joint venture with PGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGain (loss) on sale of assets is part of EBITDA, but is presented as part of the 'divestment' cash flow.

        "page_content": "- -   onshore wind and solar PV farms (DKK 15.5 billion), including the acquisition of Brookfield Renewable Ireland and Lincoln Land and the construction of Permian Energy Center, Old 300, Muscle Shoals, Western Trail, Helena Energy Center, Haystack, and Kennoxhead 1.\n\nDivestments amounted to DKK 21.5 billion in 2021 and were mainly related to the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1 with proceeds (NIBD impact) of DKK 20.2 billion. Furthermore, we had proceeds from the divestment of a 25 % ownership interest in Ocean Wind 1 to New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) and from final settlement with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) regarding Hornsea 1.\n\n## Interest-bearing net debt\n\nInterest-bearing net debt totalled DKK 24.3 billion at the end of 2021 against DKK 12.3 billion at the end of 2020. The increase was mainly due to dividend and hybrid coupon payments of DKK 5.6 billion and a negative free cash flow of DKK 5.6 billion.\n\n## Equity and capital employed\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity was DKK 85.1 billion at the end of December 2021 against DKK 97.3 billion at the end of 2020. The reduction during 2021 was driven by unrealised losses on the hedge reserve for power hedges and, to some extent, currency hedges due to the significantly increasing prices. At the end of 2021, the posttax hedging and currency translation reserves amounted to a loss of DKK 24.8 billion.\n\n## Capital employed\n\nCapital employed was DKK 109.4 billion at the end of 2021, in line with 2020, as new investments were offset by unrealised losses on power and gas hedges. The value of our derivatives amounted to DKK -33.0 billion at the end of 2021 against DKK -0.2 billion at the end of 2020.\n\n## Financial ratios\n\n## Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) was 14.8 % in 2021. The 5.1 %-points increase compared to last year was attributable to the higher EBIT in 2021. ROCE excluding new partnership gains amounted to 7.0 % in 2021.\n\n## Credit metric (FFO/adjusted net debt)\n\nThe funds from operations (FFO)/adjusted net debt credit metric was 31 % at the end of December 2021 against 65 % last year due to a doubling of our adjusted net debt.\n\n## ESG results\n\n## Green share of heat and power generation\n\nThe green share of our heat and power generation amounted to 90 % in 2021, in line with the same period last year, but with a lower net contribution from our operating offshore (-10 %-points) and onshore (+5 %-points) assets and a higher share of biomass-based heat and power generation (+6 %-points).\n\nPower generation from our operating offshore and onshore assets only increased by 6 % as generation from new capacity was offset by lower\n\nwind speeds. In contrast, thermal-based heat and power generation increased by 33 % driven by higher heat demand (due to colder weather), higher prices, and higher spreads, which also led to higher condensing power generation.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe greenhouse gas intensity from our heat and power generation and other operating activities (scope 1 and 2) was 58 g CO 2 e/ kWh in 2021, which was at the same level as in 2020.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain and sales activities (scope 3) decreased by 28 % to 18.2 million tonnes in 2021, driven\n\nby 32 % lower gas sales following the divestment of the LNG activities in 2020. This was partly offset by larger emissions related to new onshore assets being commissioned.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2021, we had 74 total recordable injuries (TRIs), of which 46 injuries were related to contractors' employees. This was a decrease of 3 injuries compared to the same period last year or a reduction of 4 %. The number of hours worked was 24.8 million hours, an increase of 15 % compared to 2020. During 2021, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) decreased from 3.6 in 2020 to 3.0.\n\n## Sustainable finance and the EU taxonomy\n\nSustainable finance is a critical enabler of the green transformation of industries across the EU and globally. The EU taxonomy is the first legal definition of sustainable activities. It provides a common framework for identifying when an economic activity can be considered sustainable and will help investors and companies make sustainable investment decisions. It is to be used as a tool to help plan, execute, and report on the transition to a sustainable economy.\n\nDuring 2021, we have assessed whether our activities can be identified in the taxonomy and thereby be classified as taxonomy-eligible. As required by the regulation, we disclose our taxonomy-eligible shares of revenue, operating expenditure (OPEX), and gross investments (CAPEX) for 2021, along with voluntarily disclosing our taxonomy-eligible EBITDA.\n\nIn 2021, the taxonomy-eligible share of revenue was 66 %, and OPEX was 80 %, whereas the shares\n\nof our EBITDA and CAPEX were 90 % and 99 %, respectively. The non-eligible part of our revenue primarily concerned our long-term activities related to sourcing and sale of gas (21 % of revenue in 2021), Danish CHP plants, where fossil fuels still accounted for 31 % of the fuels used, and sale of power to end users (activity not covered by the taxonomy). We expect the share of taxonomy-eligible revenue to increase in the coming years.\n\nTo fulfil the criteria for taxonomy-alignment, we have documented our efforts on substantial contribution, doing no significant harm, and adhering to minimum safeguards for our activities. Thus, we expect all our eligible activities to be fully confirmed as taxonomy-aligned from 2022.\n\nSee our full EU taxonomy reporting in our ESG performance report: orsted.com/ESGperformance2021",

The increase was mainly driven by the significantly higher power and gas prices.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nOperating profit (EBITDA) totalled DKK 8.3 billion compared to DKK 5.0 billion in Q4 2020.\n\nEarnings from wind and solar assets in operation were DKK 0.7 billion lower than Q4 2020 and amounted to DKK 4.7 billion. The negative impact from the energy crunch (DKK - 1.0 billion), higher TNUoS tariffs following the divestment of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 1 in Q1 2021, and the farm-down of Borssele 1 & 2 in May was only partly offset by ramp-up generation and the acquisitions of Lincoln Land and BRI.\n\nEarnings from construction agreements and divestment gains increased by DKK 2.6 billion and amounted to DKK 2.5 billion, of which earnings from new partnerships accounted for DKK 3.2 billion. Earnings from existing partnerships decreased by DKK 0.6 billion and was mainly related to provisions for further wake compensations.\n\nIn Offshore, 'Other, incl. project development costs' were DKK 0.5 billion higher and mainly related to expensed project development costs.\n\nEBITDA from our CHP plants increased by DKK 1.4 billion and amounted to DKK 1.7 billion. The increase was mainly due to higher power prices and spreads, which also led to higher generation.\n\nEBITDA from Gas Markets & Infrastructure increased by DKK 0.4 billion and amounted to DKK 0.8 billion. The increase was mainly due to strong underlying performance in a very volatile and bullish gas market.\n\n## Profit for the quarter\n\nProfit for Q4 2021 totalled DKK 3.3 billion, DKK 1.1 billion higher than Q4 2020. The increase was mainly due to the higher EBITDA.\n\n## Cash flows from operating activities\n\nCash flows from operating activities totalled DKK 0.7 billion in Q4 2021 compared to DKK 6.8 billion in Q4 2020. The DKK 6.1 billion decrease was mainly due to higher initial margin payments to clearing houses and higher net margin payments on unrealised hedges (approx. DKK -6.2 billion in total). This was partly offset by higher tax equity contributions and a cash inflow from work in progress.\n\n## Investments and divestments\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 11.8 in Q4 2021 and related to the construction of offshore and onshore assets.\n\nDivestments amounted to DKK 11.0 billion and mainly related to the 50 % farm-down of Greater Changhua 1.\n\n| Financial performance,  DKKm                     | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | Q/four.tf /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | %                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Revenue                                          | /three.tf/zero.tf,/six.tf/six.tf/six.tf   | /one.tf/five.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/nine.tf   | /nine.tf/seven.tf %         |\n| EBITDA                                           | /eight.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/three.tf        | /five.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/three.tf         | /six.tf/five.tf %           |\n| New partnerships                                 | /three.tf,/two.tf/one.tf/one.tf           | -

Power sales amounted to 8.8 TWh and increased by 3 %.\n\nRevenue increased by 80 % to DKK 19.4 billion. Revenue from power sales accounted for DKK 7.8 billion of the increase driven by the extraordinarily high power prices during the quarter. Revenue from offshore wind farms in operation increased by 2 % as higher achieved prices was only partly offset by the lower generation.\n\nEBITDA increased by DKK 1.1 billion relative to Q4 2020 and amounted to DKK 5.2 billion.\n\nEBITDA from sites, O&M, and PPAs amounted to DKK 4.0 billion, down 20 % relative to Q4 2020. The decrease was mainly due to a net negative effect from the energy crunch (DKK - 1.0 billion), higher TNUoS tariffs following the divestment of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 1 in Q1 2021, and the farm-down of Borssele 1 & 2 in May.\n\nEarnings from construction agreements and divestment gains amounted to DKK 2.5 billion, of which earnings from new partnerships accounted for DKK 3.2 billion. Earnings from existing partnerships decreased by DKK 0.6 billion and was mainly related to provisions for further wake compensations.\n\n'Other, incl. project development costs' were DKK 0.5 billion higher and were mainly related to expensed project development costs.\n\n## Onshore\n\nPower generation increased by 55 % relative to Q4 2020. The increase was primarily due to new assets in operation (Western Trail, Lincoln Land, BRI, Permian Energy Center, and Muscle Shoals).\n\nEBITDA increased by 64 % to DKK 0.5 billion, primarily due to the above-mentioned increase in generation, partly offset by higher costs.\n\n## Bioenergy & Other\n\nRevenue increased by 130 % compared to Q4 2020 and amounted to DKK 13.3 billion. The increase was due to significantly higher gas and power prices and higher power and heat generation, partly offset by lower gas volumes.\n\nEBITDA totalled DKK 2.4 billion which was DKK 1.8 billion higher than in Q4 2020.\n\nEBITDA from CHP plants increased by DKK 1.4 billion due to higher power prices, higher power and heat generation, and higher sale of ancillary services. As we only hedge the power we co-generate with heat, we fully benefitted from the high power prices on our condensing power generation in the quarter.\n\nEBITDA from Gas Markets & Infrastructure increased by DKK 0.4 billion and amounted to DKK 0.8 billion. The higher earnings were mainly due to strong underlying performance in a very volatile and bullish gas market where we were able to optimise purchase from our long-term gas contracts.\n\n<!-- image

Availability ended at 94 %, which was in line with 2020.\n\nRevenue increased by 47 % to DKK 50.8 billion.\n\nRevenue from power sales increased by DKK 14.7 billion due to significantly higher power prices despite lower volumes sold. Revenue from offshore wind farms in operation amounted to DKK 18.4 billion, a DKK 1.0 billion decrease compared to last year, due to the earlier-mentioned lower power generation.\n\nRevenue from construction agreements increased by DKK 2.7 billion and related mainly to the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 1 in 2021 and the construction of Greater Changhua 1 for partners. In\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur colleagues at Formosa 1, off the coast of Miaoli County, Taiwan.\n\n2020, revenue was primarily related to the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Walney Extension, the construction of Virginia Coastal Wind, and the finalisation of Hornsea 1.\n\nEBITDA increased by 22 % relative to 2020 and amounted to DKK 18.0 billion.\n\nEBITDA from Sites, O&M, and PPAs amounted to DKK 13.1 billion in 2021, a DKK 2.4 billion decrease compared to last year. Ramp-up of generation combined with the addition of CFDs for the last 400 MW of capacity from Hornsea 1 and a positive effect from ceasing to use the business performance principle in 2021 (approx. DKK 1.0 billion) contributed positively to our site earnings. However, this was more than offset by significantly lower wind speeds across our offshore portfolio (approx. DKK 2.8 billion compared to last year), higher TNUoS tariffs following the divestment of the offshore transmission assets at Walney Extension in mid-2020 and Hornsea 1 in Q1 2021, OPEX related to preparing Hornsea 2 and Greater Changhua 1 & 2a for commissioning, and Horns Rev 2 coming off subsidy in October 2020. In addition to lower wind speeds and the effects guided at the beginning of the year, the last four months of the year was negatively impacted by the energy crunch with very high power prices and high volatility. This impacted our earnings through higher balancing and intermittency costs",

        "page_content": "(approx. DKK 0.7 billion in total vs. 2020) and through costs related to buy-back of hedges and overhedging due to low generation.\n\nEBITDA from partnerships amounted to DKK 7.5 billion and was primarily related to the gain on the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1 (new partnerships) of DKK 8.5 billion. Earnings from existing partnerships amounted to DKK -1.0 billion, a decrease of DKK 2.6 billion compared to last year, which saw high earnings related to the Hornsea 1 transmission assets. In 2021, earnings were negatively impacted by a DKK 0.8 billion warranty provision towards our partners related to cable protection system issues at some of our offshore wind farms and further wake provisions.\n\nEBITDA from other activities, including project development, amounted to DKK -2.6 billion, DKK 0.3 billion lower than last year, and was mainly related to expensed project development costs.\n\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to DKK -0.9 billion, which was DKK 10.9 billion lower than in 2020. The decrease was driven by the significantly higher power prices leading to large margin payments on unrealised financial instruments (DKK -7.5 billion in 2021) and initial margin payments to clearing houses (DKK -5.6 billion in 2021). Furthermore, the lower EBITDA (excluding the gain from the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1, where proceeds are included in the divestment cash flow) contributed to the negative development in cash flows. These negative effects were only partly offset by lower receivables due to lower\n\nvolumes generated and less funds tied up in work in progress.\n\nIn 2021, we had a net cash inflow from work in progress of DKK 4.5 billion, mainly from the divestment of the Hornsea 1 offshore transmission assets and the milestone payments related to building Greater Changhua 1 for partners, only partly offset by construction work regarding the offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 2. In 2020, we had a net cash outflow of DKK 1.6 billion, mainly from supplier payments related to the construction of Hornsea 1 for partners and the offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 2, partly offset by the divestment of the offshore transmission asset at Walney Extension.\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 23.4 billion and were mainly related to Greater Changhua 1 & 2a in Taiwan, Hornsea 2 in the UK, our portfolio of US projects, and payments related to Baltica 2 & 3 in Poland through the 50/50 joint venture with PGE.\n\nDivestments amounted to DKK 21.6 billion in 2021 and were mainly related to the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1 with proceeds (NIBD impact) of DKK 20.2 billion. Furthermore, we had proceeds from the divestment of a 25 % ownership interest in Ocean Wind 1 to New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) and from final settlement with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) regarding Hornsea 1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHydrogen is reported financially as part of Offshore (included in 'Other incl. project development').\n\n| Performance

We advanced the construction of our two major wind farms, further matured and achieved key milestones for our awarded project portfolio, expanded our geographical footprint, took financial investment decision (FID) on our German portfolio, and finalised two farm-down agreements. We also obtained good availability rates on our operating assets, which partly mitigated the earnings shortfall from lower wind speeds and higher balancing costs.\n\nWe remain the world leader in offshore wind, having developed approx. 30 % of global capacity installed, excluding mainland China. We have played a key role in maturing the\n\nindustry and have built more offshore wind farms worldwide than any other company. By the end of 2021, we had 7.6 GW of capacity installed, 3.4 GW of capacity under construction, and further 8.4 GW of capacity awarded. To reach our ambition of 30 GW installed offshore capacity by 2030, we will need to add an additional 10.6 GW to our firm capacity of 19.4 GW (see definition box). This will be based on our substantiated pipeline of ~12.5 GW and on an opportunity pipeline of ~43 GW. The oversized opportunity pipeline provides us with the flexibility we need to select only projects that are truly value-creating.\n\n## Expanding our pipeline and geographical footprint\n\nDuring 2021, we achieved significant milestones in maturing our portfolio of five offshore wind farms under construction, accounting for 3.4 GW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n- German portfolio: Gode Wind 3 (253 MW) and Borkum Riffgrund 3 (913 MW).\n- 2 US North-East cluster: Revolution Wind (704 MW), South Fork (130 MW), and Sunrise Wind (924 MW).\n- 3 US Mid-Atlantic cluster: Skipjack 1 (120 MW), Ocean Wind 1 (1,100 MW), Ocean Wind 2 (1,148 MW), and Skipjack 2 (846 MW).\n\ncapacity, and nine wind farms under development, accounting for 8.4 GW capacity.\n\nWe progressed our UK Hornsea 2 project towards COD. Upon project completion expected in late H1 2022, it will be the largest offshore wind farm in the world with 1.3 GW of new capacity.\n\nIn Asia-Pacific, the construction of the 900 MW Greater Changhua 1 & 2a project is moving forward as planned and is expected to be commissioned in H2 2022. As of end of January 2022, we had installed 17 out of 111 jacket foundations, and we will start installing wind turbines and array cables in February 2022. Other notable construction and permitting milestones include the record of decision (ROD) on our 130 MW South Fork project (expected commissioning in H2 2023) and the",

The projects contribute with 2.5 GW of new capacity to be developed by working in close partnership with our 50-50 joint venture partner Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE). The two projects are expected to be commissioned by 2027 and 2026, respectively, subject to FID.\n\nOur portfolio of US offshore development projects is also moving forward. An important milestone has been the Ocean Wind 2 award by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU), where we have been selected for a 20-year OREC for a total offshore wind capacity of 1,148 MW. Another significant award came in December, when we were selected by the State of Maryland and awarded 846 MW through our Skipjack 2 project. We will build it together with the previously awarded Skipjack 1 project and expect both to begin operations in 2026.\n\nLate August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) released its notice of intent (NoI), which launched the  formal environmental review for our Sunrise Wind project. All our awarded US offshore develop ment projects (except for the recently awarded Ocean Wind 2 and Skipjack 2 projects) have now received their NoIs. We are very pleased to have achieved this important permitting milestone, and we\n\nremain confident that three of our largest US projects (Ocean Wind 1, Revolution Wind, and Sunrise Wind) are on track to be fully commissioned by 2025.\n\nOur first US projects, with expected FIDs in 2022 and 2023, that have been exposed to the federal permitting delays, carry costs related to developing a local supply chain which,  together with current cost inflation, are impacting the value creation. We  continue pursuing all technical, commercial, and regulary levers at our disposal to improve returns on these projects, in the same way as we always do. The continuous fast progress of the federal permitting processes as well as the proposed clean-energy tax policies being  considered in Congress are important supportive factors, not only for our projects, but for the accelerated build out of offshore wind in the US in general.\n\nIn New Jersey, we have, together with our long-time partner Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), submitted strategic proposals for the offshore wind transmission solicitation to integrate upcoming offshore wind farms into the state's energy grid. We support New Jerseys' ambitious clean energy targets and are confident that our bids, combining our offshore wind expertise with PSEG's extensive experience in onshore transmission, will meet New Jersey's requirements.\n\nIn Japan, we entered a development partnership with JWD and Eurus Energy and reinforced our partnership with TEPCO. We are confident these partnerships will enable us to grow our presence in the Japanese offshore wind market and contribute to the country's high\n\nambitions of reaching up to 45 GW offshore wind build-out in 2040.\n\n## Enhancing flexibility through farmdowns and divestments\n\nAs announced at our Capital Markets Day, we will continue to rely on our solid partnership model to flexibly fund our growth as we target a 50 % farm-down on all the wind farms not already covered by a joint venture. We have signed a series of farm-downs and divestment agreements during 2021.\n\nA key example is the 50 % farm-down of the 913 MW German project Borkum Riffgrund 3 to Glennmont Partners, one of Europe's largest fund managers exclusively investing in clean energy infrastructure and already our partner in Gode Wind 1. As part of the agreement, we will construct the wind farm under a full-scope EPC contract, perform operations and maintenance services for 20 years, and provide a route-to-market for the power generated. FID was taken at the end of the year, and we expect to close the divestment in Q1 2022.\n\nMoreover, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) became a 50 % shareholder in our 752 MW Borssele 1 & 2 project. The total value of the transaction amounted to DKK ~10.2 billion and marks NBIM's first investment in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure. As part of the agreement, we will provide operation and maintenance and energy balancing services for the wind farm, generating clean power to the equivalent of one million Dutch households.\n\nFinally, we were able to close the 50 % divestment of Greater Changhua 1 to Caisse\n\nde D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ) and Cathay Private Equity and the 25 % divestment agreement of Ocean Wind 1 with PSEG, both announced in 2020. We also divested our offshore transmission assets at Hornsea 1 to Diamond Transmission Partners (DTP) at a total asset value of GBP 1.2 billion (100 %).\n\n## Expanding our corporate customer portfolio\n\nDuring 2021, we were able to expand our CPPA offshore wind portfolio with five agreements, further reducing our risk exposure to merchant prices and bringing our total signed CPPA volume within offshore up to 1,787 MW (see graph). We are proud of this achievement and excited to see an increasing number of companies taking the conscious choice to embark on a transformation journey by turning to renewable power. A first example is the CPPA with Danfoss on our 209 MW Horns Rev 2 offshore wind farm, which is our first offtake contract on an offshore wind farm coming out of subsidy and shows the potential of late-life assets to provide stable revenue. Another good example is the 10-year CPPA with REWE Group for 100 MW of green power from the Borkum Riffgrund 3, which represents REWE Group's largest offtake agreement at time of signing, while our 186 MW CPPA with BASF for 25 years is recognised as the longest CPPA ever on an offshore wind farm and a testament to our ability to help key heavy-sector partners decarbonise. Finally, we do not only target to provide our partners with green power, but we share the vision of enabling 24/7 carbon-free energy solutions: This joint commitment is at the foundation of our 50 MW CPPA with Google. Lastly, the CPPA extension with",

In addition, we have signed joint venture and collaboration agreements and a letter of intent. Lastly, in January 2022, we signed an MoU with the German steel producer\n\nSalzgitter. As part of the agreement, we will produce renewable hydrogen using power from our offshore assets, which Salzgitter will utilise to decarbonise their steel production and allow the manufacturing of wind turbines through green steel. We consider this partnership as a very important milestone for us to both expand our offtake and uphold a stronger role in the decarbonisation of the wind industry.\n\nHaving strong local partners will be an important enabler to expand our presence in new growth markets. This is why in January 2022, we signed MoUs with KOSPO and KOMIPO, Korea's state-owned utilities, to jointly develop an offshore wind project close to the city of Incheon. The project is expected to provide clean energy to 1.3 million households and\n\nreduce carbon emissions by almost 4 million metric tons per year, thus making significant contributions to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nOur MoU with Enefit, a leading utility company in the Baltics, outlines the vision of jointly becoming the leading offshore wind developer in the region. The collaboration offers a green path forward for decarbonising the Baltic countries, and the ambition is to deliver largescale offshore renewable energy before 2030. As part of the MoU, we further intend to establish a joint venture to develop up to 2 GW capacity, including the Liivi offshore wind project in the Estonian part of the Gulf of Riga.\n\nWe are also leveraging our partners' experience to fast-track our expertise in emerging technologies. Our joint venture in the UK with the floating wind expert BlueFloat Energy and Falck Renewables has been key to being awarded 1 GW floating wind seabed lease in the Crown Estate Scotland's ScotWind seabed competition in January 2022. Through this first large-scale floating wind development project, we are committed to help unlocking the full offshore wind potential in Scotland and look forward to combining our decades of experience in the UK and overseas with our partners' expertise in floating wind.\n\nAnother significant strategic partnership achieved during 2021 is the MoU with the Danish pension fund ATP to jointly bid for the Danish North Sea energy island (expected to be tendered in late 2023). To add to this visionary ambition for developing renewable energy at an unprecedented scale, we signed\n\nan MoU with three world-leading industrial construction experts to support our bid: Aarsleff, Bouygues, and Van Oord. With these partners on board, the \u00d8rsted-ATP consortium has laid the foundation for a successful delivery of the North Sea energy island.\n\n## Sharpening our EPC execution ability\n\nDuring 2021, we focused on sharpening our EPC execution ability, creating a more global EPC organisation, and continuing to drive even greater efficiencies. To achieve this, we took a series of important steps. First, we have established a global framework to improve proximity to local stakeholders, increase organisational flexibility and efficiency, and expand access to talent. We have also driven significant IT tool and process improvement across the organisation and implemented a new 'way we work' system to enhance standardisation and increase ability to work seamlessly on a global scale. Moreover, we have harvested execution learnings and supply chain synergies across our project programmes. Key examples have been our ability to drive execution of Hornsea 2 and Greater Changhua 1 & 2a despite the COVID-19 lockdown and challenging conditions. Besides that, we have significantly matured the US project portfolio towards permitting and execution.",

We see enormous potential in using renewable hydrogen and green fuels to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors. Towards 2030, we will execute on and expand our strong project pipeline, which currently includes ten renewable hydrogen projects and over 3 GW of full electrolyser capacity potential, as shown in the figure on the next page.\n\n## Delivering first operational results\n\nIn 2021, we started construction work at our demonstration project H2RES, which will produce renewable hydrogen for road transport powered by our two 3.6 MW offshore wind turbines at Aved\u00f8re Holme, Denmark. H2RES will have an electrolyser capacity of 2 MW and will be the first hydrogen project in operation with first production expected in the first half of 2022.\n\n## Increasing our pipeline and expanding our geographic footprint\n\nDuring 2021, we were able to reach significant milestones in maturing our project\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe shipping industry will be one of the offtakers of green fuels, such as e-methanol.\n\nopportunities and unlocking new funding pathways.\n\nOne first example is the agreement with Danish utility HOFOR to source renewable power for the next phases of the Green Fuels for Denmark (GFDK) project from their 250 MW offshore wind farm Aflandshage, which is expected to deliver first power by 2024/2025. The GFDK project unites some of the strongest partners in the Danish transport and energy sector to fulfil Denmark's ambitious vision for large-scale production of renewable hydrogen and green fuels. It achieved a significant milestone as the project was selected for EU notification as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) by the Danish Business Authority as one of only two Danish projects. Now, we await the final IPCEI approval by the EU Commission expected in the first half of 2022 and the subsequent Danish funding commitment.\n\nBesides GFDK, the HySCALE project in Germany and the Yara Sluiskil project in the Netherlands have also been selected for EU notification as IPCEI projects and also await approval and subsequent potential funding, while the Lingen Green Hydrogen project in Germany is part of the next wave of projects to be pre-notified by the EU Commission.",

Operations remained generally stable throughout the year with availability in line with expectations, and we were able to maintain our assets operating with no major losses, also during the unprecedented Texas winter storm in February.\n\nOur onshore renewable platform now accounts for 3.4 GW of installed capacity and 1.3 GW under construction. At our Capital Markets Day in June, we set a new ambition of 17.5 GW by 2030. To reach this target, we can count on an additional ~11.5 GW of substantiated pipeline, meant as projects where we have secured land through acquisitions, leases or options, and/or projects where we have secured line of sight to connect to the energy grid.\n\n## Growing and diversifying our operating portfolio\n\nDuring 2021, we added 1,356 MW of build-out to our operating portfolio in the US by commissioning three projects and by acquiring an operational onshore wind farm in one of the largest markets in the US, where we previously did not have a presence. In addition, we substantially completed the construction of the wind farm Haystack (298 MW), with final tests and commissioning works to be completed during H1 2022.\n\nWithin our wind portfolio, we were able to finalise and commission Western Trail, our largest onshore wind project accounting for 367 MW. The project, located in Texas close to our existing wind farm Lockett, is eligible for 100 % of the production tax credits. The majority of Western Trail's power generation is contracted under long-term purchase contracts with Nucor, Pepsi, and Hormel and is the first project\n\nin our portfolio to feature an upside sharing structure on the power price used for settlement. The structure reduces downside risk and allows for the capture of additional revenue compared to traditional PPAs.\n\nBesides commissioning own assets, we have also finalised the acquisition of Lincoln Land, a 302 MW operational onshore wind farm in Illinois. This is our first project in the Midcontinental independent system operator (MISO) area, which is an attractive market and one of the largest in the US. The project is eligible for 100 % of the production tax credits and is contracted under long-term PPAs with Meta (Facebook) and McDonalds.\n\nTurning to the operational progress of our solar PV portfolio, we finalised two projects over the course of 2021. The first commissioned solar project is Permian Energy Center, a 420 MWAC and 40 MWAC combined solar and energy storage facility in Texas. Permian is our first large-scale solar project, and it is eligible for 100 % of the investment tax credits.\n\nThe second commissioned solar project, Muscle Shoals, is our second large-scale solar farm and our first operating asset in the South-East of the US. The 227 MWAC solar farm, located in Alabama, is fully contracted under a long-term PPA with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is eligible for 100 % of the investment tax credits.\n\n## Expanding our pipeline and geographical footprint\n\nDuring the year, we expanded our development portfolio through the acquisition of Brookfield Renewable Ireland (BRI) and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWind speed, load factor, and availability for wind is US only.\n\n| Performance highlights                     |         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf        | %                          |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Business drivers                           |         |                                            |                                       |                            |\n| Decided (FID) and installed ca- pacity     | GW      | /four.tf./seven.tf                         | /three.tf./four.tf                    | /three.tf/eight.tf %       |\n| Installed capacity                         | GW      | /three.tf./four.tf                         | /one.tf./seven.tf                     | /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf %  |\n| Wind speed                                 | m/s     | /seven.tf./four.tf                         | /seven.tf./six.tf                     | (/three.tf %)              |\n| Load factor, wind                          | %       | /four.tf/two.tf                            | /four.tf/five.tf                      | (/three.tf %p)             |\n| Load factor, solar PV                      | %       | /two.tf/four.tf                            | -

The acquisition marked our entry into the European onshore market and allowed us to establish a platform of high-potential development projects that will contribute to our overall ambition. Since the acquisition, we have integrated systems and processes and progressed development across the newly acquired project portfolio.\n\nLooking at our own asset portfolio, we were able to secure FID on three assets. The first one, Lisheen 3, is a 29 MW wind project in Ireland acquired through BRI, located adjacent\n\nto our existing Lisheen 1 & 2 projects and forming an 89 MW cluster. The project is fully contracted under a 20-year PPA with Meta (Facebook) and is expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2022.\n\nSecondly, we took FID on Ballykeel, adding 16 MW to our onshore capacity under construction, and signed a 15-year CPPA with Amazon on the same asset for the full electricity output.\n\nMoreover, we reached FID on Helena Energy Center, our first combined onshore wind and solar PV project, accounting for 518 MW and strengthening our presence in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The project includes 268 MW of onshore wind, which will be eligible for 80 % of the production tax credits, and 250 MWAC of solar PV, which will be eligible for 100 % of the investment tax credits. During 2021, we secured commitments\n\nfrom tax equity investors for both phases of the project. The project is our first in the southern ERCOT zone, which is a highly liquid market with significant interest in PPAs from corporate customers. The wind phase of the project will mark our first relationship with Vestas within Onshore, as the project is expected to use the Vestas V150 4.2 MW wind turbines, which delivers further technology diversification in our operating wind project portfolio. We expect the wind portion of the project to be commissioned in Q2 2022 and the solar portion to be commissioned before the end of the year.\n\n## Expanding our corporate customer portfolio\n\nDuring 2021, we announced newly signed CPPAs with nine companies globally, excluding the agreements inherited from our BRI portfolio. The majority of the PPAs signed in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Projects where we have secured land through acquisitions, leases, or options, and/or projects where we have secured line of sight to connect to the energy grid.\n- 2 Ballykeel reached FID in January 2022 and was therefore not included in year-end 2021 capacity of 4,688 MW.\n\nthe US was for projects we either commissioned during the year or are planning to bring online during 2022.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 73 % of generation from our asset portfolio of onshore wind and solar projects across the US and Ireland were contracted with external counterparties with an average duration of 12 years. The contracted share for most individual projects ranges from 65 % to 100 % and is dependent on the market, project risk profile, attractiveness of contract terms, and risk-reduction potential.\n\nMost of our PPA counterparts are strategic customers whose businesses span across geographies and technologies. In this sense, our diverse Onshore asset platform is commercially attractive and positions us to be a trusted partner for companies seeking to offtake green energy solutions.",

Heat generation increased by 19 % in 2021, mainly due to colder weather.\n\nRevenue increased by 51 % compared to 2020 and amounted to DKK 32.4 billion. The increase was driven by five times higher average gas prices and three times higher average power prices, which led to higher revenue in our gas and power sales businesses. Furthermore, we had higher revenue from our CHP plants due to higher generation and power prices in Denmark. This was partly offset by the divestment of our RBC businesses in August 2020, the LNG activities in December 2020, and part of our B2B business on 1 March 2021.\n\nEBITDA amounted to DKK 4.7 billion compared to DKK 2.1 billion in 2020.\n\nEBITDA from CHP plants was 188 % higher than last year, totalling DKK 3.2 billion in 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher power prices and generation in Denmark, combined with higher earnings from ancillary services. As we only hedge the power we co-generate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur colleagues in Asn\u00e6s Power Station, Kalundborg, Denmark.\n\nwith heat, we fully benefitted from the high power prices on our condensing power generation in the second half of the year.\n\nEBITDA from Gas Markets & Infrastructure amounted to DKK 1.8 billion in 2021, a DKK 1.4 billion increase relative to last year. The positive effect was mainly driven by the renegotiation of gas purchase contracts and strong underlying performance, especially in H2 2021, in a very volatile and bullish gas market where we were able to optimise purchase from our long-term gas contracts.\n\nEBITDA from our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses amounted to DKK 0.9 billion in 2020, which has not been repeated due to the divestment in August 2020.\n\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to DKK 7.6 billion in 2021. The DKK 4.7 billion increase was driven by the significantly higher gas prices, leading to receipt of large margin payments on unrealised financial instruments (DKK 6.1 billion in 2021). The higher EBITDA also contributed positively to the development. This was partly offset by higher initial margin posted at clearing houses (DKK -1.7 billion) and significantly higher spend to fill our gas at storage due to the increasing gas prices.\n\nGross investments amounted to DKK 0.3 billion in 2021 and mainly related to reinvestments at our CHP plants.",

        "page_content": "Cash flow from divestments in 2020 was mainly related to the above-mentioned divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses.\n\n## Strategic and operational performance 2021\n\nDuring 2021, we harvested the benefits of having a broad portfolio of generation assets. Our CHP plants not only filled the gap when renewable generation assets supplied less power to the grid than normal due to low wind speeds, but also benefitted from high power prices and attractive spreads during the second half of the year. As our gas business also had a strong financial performance in 2021, Bioenergy & Other showed a strong diversification effect, offsetting the negative impacts from low wind speeds in Offshore.\n\nIn 2021, we completed the divestment of the majority of our UK B2B customers to Total Gas & Power. The remaining part of the UK B2B activities will be phased out in step with the expiry of our obligations, to a significant extent during 2022. Going forward, our B2B activities will be centred around Denmark and the southern part of Sweden, serving as a natural outlet for our long-term gas sourcing contracts, with cross-selling of power.\n\nDuring the year, we also concluded the renegotiations of some of our long-term gas contracts. Besides obtaining a satisfactory financial result from the renegotiations, we managed to further reduce the risk of our exposure in the contracts as the future\n\nindexation will be towards gas prices rather than oil prices.\n\nLastly, we also took steps to decarbonise our CHP plants. One key example is the MoU signed with Norwegian Aker Carbon Capture and Microsoft to explore the potential for developing carbon capture at our biomassfired combined heat and power plants.\n\nFurthermore, we signed an agreement with VEKS and CTR to rebuild the straw-fired unit at Aved\u00f8re Power Station to enable heatonly production and thereby increase plant flexibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBITDA increased by 122 %.\n\n| Performance highlights                  |         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf              | %                            |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Business drivers                        |         |                                            |                                             |                              |\n| Degree days                             | number  | /two.tf,/eight.tf/two.tf/zero.tf           | /two.tf,/four.tf/three.tf/two.tf            | /one.tf/six.tf %             |\n| Heat generation                         | GWh     | /seven.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf        | /six.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/one.tf             | /one.tf/nine.tf %            |\n| Power generation                        | GWh     | /six.tf,/eight.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf          | /four.tf,/four.tf/three.tf/eight.tf         | /five.tf/five.tf %           |\n| Gas sales                               | GWh     | /six.tf/one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/nine.tf   | /nine.tf/zero.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/seven.tf | (/three.tf/two.tf %)         |\n| Power sales                             | GWh     | /eight.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf       | /one.tf/one.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/three.tf      | (/two.tf/four.tf %)          |\n| Gas price, TTF                          | EUR/MWh | /four.tf/five.tf./seven.tf                 | /nine.tf./three.tf                          | /three.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf % |\n| Power price, DK                         | EUR/MWh | /eight.tf/seven.tf./eight.tf               | /two.tf/six.tf./seven.tf                    | /two.tf/two.tf/nine.tf %     |\n| Green dark spread, DK                   | EUR/MWh | /four.tf./eight.tf                         | (/one.tf/one.tf./two.tf)                    | n.a.                         |\n| Green spark spread, DK                  | EUR/MWh | (/two.tf/three.tf./four.tf)                | (/one.tf./four.tf)                          | n.a.                         |\n| Wood pellet spread, DK                  | EUR/MWh | /two.tf/nine.tf./eight.tf                  | (/two.tf/six.tf./six.tf)                    | n.a.                         |\n| Financial performance                   |         |                                            |                                             |                              |\n| Revenue                                 | DKKm    | /three.tf/two.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/one.tf,/four.tf/two.tf/zero.tf      | /five.tf/one.tf %            |\n| EBITDA                                  | DKKm    | /four.tf,/seven.tf/four.tf/seven.tf        | /two.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/six.tf             | /one.tf/two.tf/two.tf %      |\n| CHP plants                              |         | /three.tf,/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf           | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/one.tf               | /one.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf %  |\n| Gas Markets & Infrastructure            |         | /one.tf,/eight.tf/two.tf/nine.tf           | /four.tf/one.tf/one.tf                      | /three.tf/four.tf/five.tf %  |\n| Distribution, B/two.tfC, and city light |         | -

        "page_content": "## Message from the Chairman\n\nThe Board of Directors firmly believes that purpose, diversity, and integrity are key drivers of good corporate governance. We will continue to strengthen our governance model addressing those important principles.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we had a successful and smooth CEO transition. We welcomed Mads Nipper as our new CEO, and he brought with him a deep commitment to the sustainability agenda, exceptional personal leadership, and an excellent track record in leading global companies.\n\nIn addition, we welcomed Julia King and Henrik Poulsen, our former CEO. They are both visionary individuals who will provide us with important skills and experiences.\n\nThis year, we also took actions to further strengthen our corporate governance model, which is built on three pillars: enabling decisionmaking, having the right competences, and fostering a company culture rooted in integrity. These pillars are the foundation for our way of working throughout the organisation, from the Board to the individual employee.\n\nWe reorganised our business to strengthen decision-making power, engage in crossfunctional collaboration, and enhance the complementarity of competences. We transitioned from traditional business units to a structure based on functions, with a commercially focused function and an EPC\n\n& Operations focused function. The new structure was designed to promote future growth opportunities with a more holistic and customer-centric market approach.\n\nWe welcome and generally follow the updated recommendations prepared by the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. We are pleased to see the recommendations now include the companies' purpose, and that they ensure and promote good culture and values in the company, which we have had a strong emphasis on for many years.\n\nThe Board wants to ensure that sustainability is incorporated into our entire way of working, including our governance mechanisms. Therefore, we have updated the Executive Committee's short-term incentive (STI) scheme so it has a stronger and more systematic integration of ESG, effective from 2022. Our new STI is designed to support that we deliver on our core sustainability commitments, improve our sustainability leadership performance, and continue to push for new frontiers.\n\nFurthermore, it is a priority for the Board to support and develop a company culture based on high ethical standards and clear values\n\nthat permeate across our entire business. Our Executive Committee is spearheading this culture throughout the organisation, focusing strongly on teamwork. Team efforts and collaboration are key to succeeding as a company and delivering strong results. Therefore, the Board has also updated the weight distribution of the STI for the Executive Committee. In the new STI, shared targets will increase from 40 % to 70 % of the total award.\n\nWe want to ensure the right competences to successfully drive our business forward. In the Board, we continuously work to promote the diversity of competences and perspectives, as we recognise the many advantages that diversity brings. At the annual general meeting in April 2022, we will therefore propose that our employees outside of Denmark may participate in elections of employee representatives to the Board to enable more diversity in the Board itself.\n\nFinally, we have reinforced our commitment to gender diversity across the company. Our ambition for gender balance is to have at least 40 % women across our total workforce by 2030. In addition, we will work to ensure that diversity and inclusion are further embedded\n\nin our hiring and promotion processes. These are just some of the many steps that we will take to ensure we attract, retain, and develop the right talent and competences.\n\nOn the following pages, you can read more about our corporate governance, and how we work with it. I look forward to continuing serving on the Board in the coming year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThomas Thune Andersen Chairman",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nThe overall and strategic management of the company is anchored in a board of non-executive directors appointed by the shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Executive Board, consisting of the Group President and CEO, the Deputy Group CEO and CCO, and the CFO who undertake the day-to-day management of \u00d8rsted through the Executive Committee. None of our executives are members of the Board of Directors. A management team consisting of the Executive Committee, the senior vice presidents, and certain vice presidents drives strategic development and cultural alignment across the company.\n\n## Our governance model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders and general meeting\n\n\u00d8rsted is a publicly listed company with the Danish State as majority shareholder with a 50.1 % ownership share. The Danish State exercises its ownership interest in \u00d8rsted in accordance with the ordinary governance set-up in Danish companies where a board of non-executive directors (the Board of Directors) and executive directors (the Executive Board) are responsible for the management of the company. The Danish State exercises its interest at the general meeting. The Danish State's ownership policy is available here (only in Danish): fm.dk/udgivelser/2015/april/ statens-ejerskabspolitik/.\n\nAll our shareholders may exercise their rights and vote at the general meeting through a one-share-one-vote principle. The general meeting adopts decisions, such as the election of the Board of Directors and the auditor, in accordance with the ordinary Danish rules. Due to our majority ownership by the Danish State, we have a bespoke quorum requirement, as proposals to amend our articles of association or dissolve the company require that the Danish State participates in the general meeting and supports the proposals.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nEach year at the annual general meeting, the shareholders elect six to eight board members.\n\nIn addition, our employees may elect members corresponding to half of the board members elected by the general meeting pursuant to Danish mandatory rules. Employee elections are held every four years, with the next election being in 2022.\n\nFor the time being, our Board of Directors comprises 11 members, eight members elected by the general meeting, and three members elected by the employees. At the employee election in 2022, the employees will have a right to elect four members to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the overall and strategic management of the company. The Board of Directors lays down the company's strategy and makes decisions concerning major investments and divestments, the capital base, key policies, control and audit matters, risk management, and significant operational issues. You can see the most important tasks in 2021 on the next page.\n\nThe Board of Directors monitors and oversees progress related to our sustainability and climate change strategy, including our ambitious net-zero carbon reduction targets for scope 1-3 emissions. We routinely integrate climate change considerations when setting our strategic direction, reviewing sustainability\n\nrisks, setting performance objectives, deciding on our capital allocation, and when approving and overseeing major investments, acquisitions, and divestments.\n\nThe Board of Directors has prepared an overview of the competences required on the board. The list of required competences can be found at orsted.com/competences-overview.\n\nWe have a diverse Board of Directors. With three female board members out of the eight elected by the general meeting, we have equal representation as defined under Danish law. The age of our board members spans from 50 to 71 years old among board members elected by the general meeting and from 37 to 54 years old among board members elected by the employees. Board members have different educational backgrounds within finance, economics, geophysics, or engineering and professional experience from the energy or other industries, private equity, private investments, and/or academia.\n\nA description of the individual board members, including their other executive positions, independence, and how the individual board members contribute to the required competences can be found in the following pages. Their meeting attendance during 2021 can be found on the next page.",

In the separate remuneration report, you can read more about the remuneration of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, we have considered the recommendations prepared by the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. As further described in our corporate governance report, we partially comply with the following recommendations:\n\n- -   Recommendation 1.2.1: Due to lack of shareholder interest in attending virtual general meetings, we do not, for the time being, offer this option to our shareholders.\n- -   Recommendation 3.2.2: As former CEO Henrik Poulsen joined the Board of Directors in March 2021, we did not, at the time of his appointment, comply with the part of the recommendation setting out that an executive retiring from the executive management should not join the board of directors immediately thereafter. It is the assessment of the Board of Directors that it was in the best interest of \u00d8rsted that Henrik Poulsen's skills and experience remained available to the company.\n\nSee link to the remuneration report below.

        "page_content": "## Committees of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors has appointed two committees from among its members: An Audit & Risk Committee and a Nomination & Remuneration Committee which assist the Board of Directors within selected areas.\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee\n\nDieter Wemmer (Chairman), J\u00f8rgen Kildahl, and Peter Korsholm are the members of the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nThe committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the financial and ESG reporting process (including key accounting estimates and judgements), liquidity and capital structure development, financial and businessrelated risks, compliance with statutory and other requirements from public authorities, internal controls, IT security in operational and administrative areas as well as cybersecurity.\n\nMoreover, the committee approves the framework governing the work of the company's external and internal auditors (including limits for non-audit services), evaluates the external auditors' independence and qualifications, and monitors the company's whistle-blower scheme.\n\nIn 2021, the committee reviewed the financial impact of the implementation of IFRS hedge accounting on all commodity and related currency hedges, the acquisition of Brookfield Renewable Ireland, the implementation of the new EU taxonomy reporting, and lastly, the impact from the increased energy prices on the risk management procedures and the financial statement.\n\nFurthermore, the committee continued to assess the claim made by the Danish Tax Agency requiring further Danish taxation of our British offshore wind farms Walney Extension, Hornsea 1, and Race Bank (added during the year), and lastly, it reviewed the progress in IT security.\n\nOur Internal Audit function reports to the Audit & Risk Committee and is independent of our administrative management structures. Internal Audit enhances and protects the organisational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice, and insight. The focus for Internal Audit is auditing and advising on our core processes, governance, risk management, control processes, and IT security.\n\nThe Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for managing our whistle-blower scheme. Internal Audit receives and handles any reports submitted. Our employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistleblower scheme or through our management system. In 2021, five substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistle-blower scheme. Four cases related to the workplace environment, while one case concerned IT security. None of the reported cases were critical to our business, nor caused adjustments to our financial results. None of the cases required a police report.\n\nWhistle-blower cases are taken very seriously, and we continuously enhance the awareness\n\nof good business conduct through education and awareness campaigns to minimise future similar cases.\n\nYou can read more about the Audit & Risk Committee and the terms of reference for the committee at orsted.com/auditrisk-committee.\n\n## Nomination & Remuneration Committee\n\nThomas Thune Andersen (Chairman), Lene Skole, and Lynda Armstrong are the members of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe committee assists the Board of Directors in matters regarding the composition, remuneration, and performance of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee.\n\nIn 2021, the committee discussed, among other matters, changes to the Executive Board and Executive Committee, including the appointment of Martin Neubert as Deputy Group CEO, CCO, and new member of the Executive Board, the recruitment of Richard Hunter as new COO and member of the Executive Committee, and the appointment of Neil O'Donovan as new CEO of Onshore and member of the Executive Committee. Following CFO Marianne Wiinholt's resignation in December, the committee initiated a search process for her successor.\n\nThe committee also reviewed the remuneration policy for the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. The updates include the introduction of a fixed travel compensation for members for the Board of Directors residing\n\noutside of Europe and an authorisation for the Board of Directors to establish an indemnity scheme covering the Board of Directors and the Executive Board. For the time being, the Board of Directors has not made use of the authorisation to establish an indemnity scheme. An updated version of the remuneration policy was subsequently approved by the annual general meeting in March 2021. The committee also discussed changes to the Executive Committee's short-term incentive (STI) scheme. The scheme will be updated to have a stronger and more systematic integration of ESG to further support our sustainability strategy as well as a higher weight of shared targets to support team efforts and collaboration. It will be effective from 2022.\n\nFinally, the committee discussed an equal pay analysis in addition to the gender pay gap reporting disclosed in the ESG performance report.\n\nYou can read more about the Nomination & Remuneration Committee and the terms of reference for the committee at orsted.com/ nomination-remuneration-committee.",

The loss of DKK 7,530 million transferred to the income statement mainly consists of losses related to the hedging of power and gas.\n\nExchange rate adjustments: In 2021, foreign exchange gains relating to net investments in foreign enterprises amounting to DKK 6,717 million were primarily attributable to an increase of 7 % in the GBP exchange rate, an increase of 8 % in the USD exchange rate, and an increase of 9 % in the NTD exchange rate. A large part of the net investments was hedged.",

Trade payables relating to purchases of intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment are not recognised in change in trade payables.\n\n'Change in tax equity partner liabilities' relates to cash contributions from tax equity partners and repayment hereof through production tax credits (PTCs) and other tax attributes to tax equity partners. See also note 3.8 'Tax equity liabilities'.\n\n'Cash flows from investing activities' comprise payments in connection with the purchase and sale of non-current assets and enterprises as well as the purchase and sale of securities that are not recognised as cash and cash equivalents.\n\n'Cash flows from financing activities' comprise changes in the size or composition of equity and loans, including instalments on leases and net proceeds related to interest-bearing tax equity liabilities. Proceeds from raising of short-term repo loans are presented net.\n\nCash flows in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the average exchange rates for the month in question, unless these differ significantly from the rates at the transaction date.",

Our operations and financial performance remain very solid despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and we identified no significant impact on our financial reporting in 2021. We have not received any governmental support in relation to COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Baltica 2 and 3\n\nIn May, we completed the acquisition of the offshore wind projects Baltica 2 and 3. See note 3.3 'Intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment'.\n\n## Brookfield Renewable Ireland\n\nIn June, we completed the acquisition of the European onshore renewable platform Brookfield Renewable Ireland. See note 3.1 'Acquistion of enterprises'.\n\n## Lincoln Land\n\nIn November, we completed the acquisition of the onshore wind farm in operation. See note 3.3 'Intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment'.\n\n## Divestments\n\n## Ocean Wind 1\n\nIn April, we completed the 25 % divestment of our offshore wind farm Ocean Wind 1 in the US. The transaction resulted in proceeds of DKK 0.7 billion. See note 3.10 'Noncontrolling interests'.\n\n## Borssele 1 & 2\n\nIn May, we completed the 50 % divestment of our offshore wind farm Borssele 1 & 2 in the Netherlands. The transaction resulted in proceeds of DKK 9.8 billion and a gain of DKK 5.0 billion. See note 3.3 'Intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment'.\n\n## Greather Changhua 1\n\nIn November, we completed the 50 % divestment of our offshore wind farm Greater Changhua 1 in Taiwan. The transaction resulted in proceeds of DKK 10.4 billion and a gain of DKK 3.5 billion. See note 3.3 ' Intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Ceasing to report according to the business performance principle\n\nWith the implementation of IFRS 9, it has become significantly easier to apply IFRS hedge accounting for our energy hedges. We have concluded that IFRS 9 can replace our business performance principle, and therefore we have reported solely based on IFRS from 1 January 2021. Thus, the business performance and adjustment columns are not included in our financial reporting. See notes 1.2 'Basis of preparation' and 1.5 'Business performance' for more information.",

        "page_content": "## /one.tf./two.tf Basis of preparation\n\nThis section provides an overall description of the accounting policies applied in our consolidated financial statements as well as the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting requirements. We provide a more detailed description of the accounting policies applied in the specific notes. Key accounting estimates and judgements as well as new and amended IFRS standards and interpretations are discussed in detail in note 1.3 'Key accounting estimates and judgements' and later in this note.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act (\u00c5rsregnskabsloven).\n\n## M/e.ss01a/s.ss01u/r.ss01/e.ss01m/e.ss01n/t.ss01 ba/s.ss01i/s.ss01\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis, except for derivatives, gas in non-Danish storage facilities, financial instruments in the trading portfolio, and carbon emission allowances in the trading portfolio which are measured at market value.\n\nThe accounting policies have been applied consistently in the financial year and for comparative figures.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of \u00d8rsted A/S (the parent company) and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S. See more in note 7.3 'Company overview'.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared as a consolidation of the  parent company's and the individual subsidiaries' financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nIntra- group income, expenses, shareholdings, balances, and dividends as well as realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statatements.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of our  ownership interest.\n\nEnterprises are accounted for as associates if we hold or have the ability to exercise, directly or indirectly, 20-50 % of the voting rights and do not exercise control. However, we carry out a specific assessment of our ability to exercise influence, including our ability to influence financial and operational decisions and thus our return. Enterprises that satisfy the criteria\n\nfor joint control are accounted for as investments in joint ventures, unless the nature of the joint arrangement is considered a joint operation. See our key accounting judgement for 'Consolidation method for partnerships' in the next column.\n\nOur shares in joint operations are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the Group's own assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions between fully consolidated enterprises and joint operations is eliminated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWest coast hub, Barrow-in-Furness, the UK.\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Consolidation method for partnerships\n\nOn establishment of partnerships and in connection with any restructuring of existing partnerships, we assess whether the structure is a joint arrangement under shared control. For joint arrangements, we subsequently assess whether they are joint ventures or joint operations.\n\nIn assessing joint operations, we look at:\n\n- -   the corporate form of the operation\n- -   whether we are only entitled to the net profit (loss) or to income and expenses resulting from the operation.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the parties buy or are assigned all output, for example the power generated, will lead to the structure being considered a joint operation if we have joint control.",

Receivables, payables, and other monetary items in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and on the date at which the receivable or payable arose is  recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income or expenses.\n\nFinancial statements of foreign subsidiaries, joint operations, associates, and joint ventures are translated into DKK at monthly average exchange rates insofar as these do not deviate materially from the  actual exchange rates at the transaction dates. Balance sheet items are  translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date.\n\nAll exchange differences are recognised in profit (loss) for the year, except for exchange differences arising on:\n\n- -  translation of the opening equity of these entities at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date\n- -   translation of the statements of comprehensive income of these enterprises from 'the average-for-the-month exchange rates' to 'the exchange rates on the balance sheet/uni00A0date'\n- -   translation of balances accounted for as part of the total net investment\n- -  translation of the portion of loans and derivatives that has been entered into to hedge the net investment in an enterprise, and that provides an effective hedge against corresponding foreign exchange gains (losses) on the net investment.\n\nThe above types of exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. Such exchange rate adjustments are divided between the equity of the parent company and the equity of the non-controlling interests. On full or partial divestment of the net investment, the accumulated exchange rate adjustments are recognised as follows:\n\n- -  Disposal resulting in loss of control: The accumulated exchange rate adjustments, including any associated hedges, are recognised in the profit (loss) for the year if a foreign exchange gain (loss) is realised by the selling enterprise. Any foreign exchange gain (loss) is transferred to the item in which the gain (loss) from the disposal is\n- recognised. The part of the foreign currency translation reserve that relates to noncontrolling interests is not transferred to profit (loss) for the year.\n- -  Disposal not resulting in loss of control: A proportionate share of the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred from the parent company shareholders' share of equity to the minority shareholders' share of equity.\n\nRepayment of balances that are considered part of the net investment does not constitute a partial disposal of the subsidiary.\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nWe are required to file our annual report in the European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') using the XHTML format and to tag the  primary consolidated financial statements using Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy. Where a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created.\n\nThe annual report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a ZIP file named W9NG6WMZIYEU8VEDOG48-2021-12-31-en.\n\n## Implementation of new and changed accounting standards and interpretations\n\nWe regularly assess the impact of new IFRS standards and interpretations. We implement new IFRS standards and interpretations from their mandatory effective dates at the latest.\n\nWe have not implemented any standards (IAS and IFRS) or interpretations in 2021.\n\n## Ceasing to report according to the business performance principle\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, we only report IFRS numbers. Thus, the business performance and adjustment columns are not included in our financial reporting. This simplifies our reporting, and potential conflicts with future reporting requirements for alternative performance measures are avoided. See note 1.5 'Business performance' for more information.\n\n## New standards and interpretations\n\nIASB has issued amended standards which have not yet entered into force, and which have consequently not been incorporated into the consolidated financial statements for 2021. None of these amended standards and interpretations are expected to have any significant impact on our financial statements.",

The estimates and judgements are based on assumptions concerning future developments which affect our application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, sales, costs, cash flows, and related disclosures. Actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated and judgements made, as more detailed information becomes available.\n\nWe regularly reassess these estimates and judgements based on, among other things, historical experience, the current situation in the financial markets, and a number of other relevant factors, i.e. the update in the annual estimated production. Changes in estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate in question is revised.\n\nAccounting estimates, judgements, and assump tions which may entail a risk of material adjustments in subsequent years are listed in the table below.\n\n| Note                |                                                        | Key accounting estimates and judgements                                                                                                            | Estimate/  judgement   | Impact of accounting  estimates and judgements   |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| /one.tf./two.tf     | Basis of preparation                                   | Consolidation method for partnerships                                                                                                              | Judgement              |                                                  |\n| /two.tf./six.tf     | Other operating income and  expenses                   | Estimates for variable selling prices related to divestments of offshore  wind farms and offshore transmission assets Classification of divestment | Estimate Judgement     |                                                  |\n| /three.tf./one.tf   | Acquisition of enterprises                             | Purchase price allocation in business combinations                                                                                                 | Estimate               |                                                  |\n| /three.tf./three.tf | Intangible assets, and property,  plant, and equipment | Key assumptions in impairment tests                                                                                                                | Estimate               |                                                  |\n| /three.tf./eight.tf | Tax equity liabilities                                 | Recognition of tax equity partners                                                                                                                 | Judgement              |                                                  |\n| /three.tf./nine.tf  | Provisions                                             | Assumptions for provisions                                                                                                                         | Estimate               |                                                  |\n| /four.tf./two.tf    | Tax on profit (loss) for the year                      | Estimates regarding recognition of income taxes                                                                                                    | Estimate               |                                                  |\n\nIn addition, we make judgements when we  apply the accounting policies.\n\nReference is made to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates and judgements as well as the assumptions applied.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe impact of accounting estimates and judgements relates to objectivity and business practice.\n\nVery objective/market-conforming\n\nObjective/partially conforming\n\nPartially subjective/partially distinctive\n\nSubjective/distinctive for \u00d8rsted",

Thus, the business performance and adjustment columns are no longer included in our financial reporting. However, throughout the management's review, we will use business performance as comparable numbers for 2020 for a better like-for-like comparison.\n\n## Impac/t.ss01 f/r.ss01om c/e.ss01a/s.ss01ing /t.ss01o /r.ss01/e.ss01po/r.ss01/t.ss01 acco/r.ss01/d.ss01ing /t.ss01o /t.ss01h/e.ss01 bu/s.ss01in/e.ss01/s.ss01/s.ss01 p/e.ss01/r.ss01fo/r.ss01manc/e.ss01 p/r.ss01incipl/e.ss01\n\nAt the end of 2020, the value of our business performance hedges deferred to a future period was DKK -2.7 billion, of which DKK -1.1 billion related to 2021. This net loss was recognised in the income statement under IFRS in previous years, as we have not previously applied hedge accounting for these hedges.\n\nConsequently, for the period 2021-2025, EBITDA (according to IFRS) will, all other things being equal, be higher by a similar amount compared to what the business performance EBITDA would have been if we had continued to report based on this principle.\n\nThe reason for ceasing the business performance is described in note 1.2 section 'Ceasing to report according to the business performance principle'.\n\n## Background for business performance\n\nIn 2011, we introduced an alternative performance measure, business performance, as a supplement to the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The business performance results reflected our internal risk management and showed the results for the period under review. The main reason for the introduction of business performance was that applying hedge accounting under the old IFRS standard IAS 39 was very time-consuming and often not possible when we use proxy hedging.\n\n## Description of business performance\n\nUnder the business performance principle, the value of all commodity hedges and related currency hedges were deferred and recognised for the period in which the hedged risk materialised. Prior to 1 January 2021, all these hedges were accounted for at fair value through profit and loss under IFRS. The accounting treatment of all other transactions were identical with IFRS.\n\nPlease refer to note 1.6 in the 2020 annual report for further descriptions of the business performance principle.",

  sale of gas or power in the market, e.g. North Pool, TTF, NBP\n- -   transmission assets for offshore wind farms at farm-down.\n\n'Over time' mainly comprises:\n\n- -   construction agreements for offshore wind farms and transmission assets\n- -   long-term contracts with customers to deliver gas, heat, or power.\n\nRevenue for the year increased by 55 % to DKK 77,673 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the significantly higher gas and power prices across all markets and the divestment of the offshore transmission asset at Hornsea 1 in 2021. This was partly offset by lower wind speeds in 2021, and the 2020 divestments of the LNG business, the Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses, and the offshore transmission asset at Walney Extension.\n\nOther revenue in Offshore primarily related to operations and maintenance agreements.\n\nIncome from government grants decreased significantly in 2021 due to lower production across our European offshore wind farms and significantly higher power prices, which led to a lower subsidy per MWh produced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn 1 January 2021, we implemented hedge accounting on our commodity and related currency hedges. Accordingly, our hedges are presented in the same line item as the hedged exposure. For example, when we hedge generation of power, any gain (loss) related to the hedge is presented in the line item 'Generation of power'.\n\n'Economic hedging' was used for hedges classified as business performance. We have ceased to report according to the business performance principle as of 1 January 2021, see note 1.5 'Business performance'.",

For these types of goods and services, we recognise the revenue that corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer (transaction price) and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, i.e. VAT. We recognise revenue when we transfer control over a product or service to a customer or a partner.\n\nIf a part of the transaction price is variable, i.e. bonus payments, incentive payments for unmissed deadlines, etc., the variable consideration is recognised in revenue when it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWe adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if the payments exceed twelve months.\n\n## Sal/e.ss01 of pow/e.ss01/r.ss01\n\nSale of power includes the sale of power sourced from other producers. The sale is recognised when the power is delivered to our customer.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts and for longterm agreements on selling power at a fixed price, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice.\n\nThe consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\n## G/e.ss01n/e.ss01/r.ss01a/t.ss01ion of pow/e.ss01/r.ss01\n\nGeneration of power is our sale of power produced at our own wind farms, solar farms, and power stations as well as the sale of ancillary services. We recognised the revenue when the power is delivered to the customer.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of power at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts and for longterm agreements on selling power at a fixed price, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice.\n\nFees for having CPH plants on standby and/or ready to increase or decrease the generation of power to balance the demand and supply in the system is considered one performance obligation fulfilled over time.\n\nThe consideration for the power is due when the actual power is delivered to the customer.\n\n## R/e.ss01v/e.ss01nu/e.ss01 f/r.ss01om con/s.ss01/t.ss01/r.ss01uc/t.ss01ion of off/s.ss01ho/r.ss01/e.ss01 win/d.ss01 fa/r.ss01m/s.ss01\n\nRevenue from construction of offshore wind farms includes development and construction. The construction agreements cover the construction phase from design to delivery of an operational asset. The agreement consists of two performance obligations:\n\n- -  Offshore wind farms.\n- -  Offshore transmission assets, if applicable.\n\nThe construction agreements cover our partners' shares of the construction of the wind farm and offshore transmission assets, if applicable. If our contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost-plus margin.\n\nWe recognise revenue over time, using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation because the customer gains control of the offshore wind farm during the construction process. The input method reflects the ongoing transfer of control.\n\nThe consideration for the construction of an offshore wind farm consists of a fixed fee and a relatively minor variable fee, depending on when the wind farm can be put into operation. The consideration for an offshore transmission asset is a fixed fee.\n\nAfter signing the construction agreement, we carry out an assessment determining when the wind farm is expected to be completed. We calculate the size of the variable payment on this basis. We only recognise the variable fee when it is highly probable that a subsequent reversal will not take place.\n\nOur partner pays the fixed consideration based on a payment schedule. The payment schedule is determined and based on the expected progress of the construction and transfer of control to the customer.\n\n## G/e.ss01n/e.ss01/r.ss01a/t.ss01ion an/d.ss01 /s.ss01al/e.ss01 of h/e.ss01a/t.ss01\n\nHeat is sold under long-term heat contracts and recognised when the heat is delivered to our customer.\n\nThe heat customer makes a prepayment to finance the majority of our CAPEX associated with the biomass conversion of the CHP plant. The prepayment is recognised as a contract liability and it is also recognised as revenue in step with the transfer of heat to the customer.\n\nPayment for the sale of heat consists of fixed costs associated with operations and maintenance of a CHP plant, fuel costs for the generation of heat, and a financial return. The consideration is due when delivered.\n\n## Sal/e.ss01 of ga/s.ss01\n\nSale of gas is our gas sourced from other producers, and it is recognised when the gas is transferred to our buyer. The transfer of control occurs either when the gas is injected into the distribution system or delivered to the customer.\n\nSales contracts for a fixed amount of gas at a variable price, or where we are exclusive suppliers to the customer at a variable price, are considered one performance obligation with multiple deliveries to be satisfied over time. For such contracts, we recognise revenue in the amount up to which we have a right to invoice. Some long-term gas sales contracts include clauses which give the right to renegotiate the fixed sales prices. Expectations for the outcomes of renegotiations are not included in revenue before we know the outcome of the individual renegotiations.\n\nThe consideration for the gas is due when the gas is injected into the distribution system or delivered to the customer.\n\n## Di/s.ss01/t.ss01/r.ss01ibu/t.ss01ion an/d.ss01 /t.ss01/r.ss01an/s.ss01mi/s.ss01/s.ss01ion\n\nFees for distribution and transmission of power, gas, and oil is recognised when the power, gas, or oil is delivered to the buyer, or when the capacity is made available.\n\nRevenue is calculated as the amount to which we are entitled when the service is delivered to the customer, and consideration is payable when invoiced.\n\n## O/t.ss01h/e.ss01/r.ss01 /r.ss01/e.ss01v/e.ss01nu/e.ss01\n\nOther revenue primarily includes operations and maintenance agreements and other services.\n\nRevenue from providing services is recognised over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. For fixed-priced contracts, revenue is recognised based on the actual service rendered at the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be rendered. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total labour hours expected.\n\nFixed-price contracts are invoiced on a monthly basis, and consideration is payable when invoiced. Variable fee services are due after the services are rendered.",

The  Burbo Bank Extension,  Walney Extension, and Hornsea 1 offshore wind farms are under the CFD regime, while our other UK offshore wind farms as well as our Renescience plant are under the ROC regime. We treat the payments from the schemes as government/uni00A0grants.\n\nFeed-in tariffs from our Dutch and German wind farms are also recognised as government grants.\n\nIncome from government grants decreased significantly in 2021 due to lower production\n\nacross our European offshore wind farms and significantly higher power prices, which led to a lower subsidy per MWh produced.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nGovernment grants comprise grants for environmentally sustainable power generation, grants for the funding of development projects, and investment grants, etc.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is  reasonable assurance that the grants will be received.\n\nGrants for the purchase of assets which we recognise in the balance sheet are recognised under deferred revenue and are transferred to other operating income in step with the depreciation of the assets to which the grants relate.\n\nAs grants for power generation are intended as a compensation for the price of power, we systematically recognise the grants under revenue in step with the power generation and thus the related revenue.\n\n| Government  grants,  DKKm                                                                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Government grants recognised in profit (loss) for the year under revenue                 | /eight.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/two.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/one.tf |\n| Government grants recognised in profit (loss) for the year under other  operating income | /two.tf/three.tf                    | /four.tf                               |\n| Government grants recognised in the balance sheet                                        | (/two.tf/three.tf)                  | (/four.tf)                             |\n| Government grants recognised for the year                                                | /eight.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/two.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/one.tf |\n\n## /two.tf./five.tf  Research and develop\u00ad ment expenditures\n\n| Expensed research  and development  expenditures,  DKKm   | Offshore                        | Onshore                | Bioenergy & Other   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  total   | Offshore                          | Onshore                 | Bioenergy & Other   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf  total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Research                                                  | /eight.tf/two.tf                | -                      | -                   | /eight.tf/two.tf                       | /eight.tf/zero.tf                 | -                       | -                   | /eight.tf/zero.tf                       |\n| Development                                               | /one.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/four.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/five.tf     | /two.tf,/zero.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf      | /one.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/nine.tf  | /one.tf/two.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/three.tf    | /one.tf,/eight.tf/five.tf/five.tf       |\n| Total                                                     | /two.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/six.tf | /one.tf/four.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/five.tf     | /two.tf,/one.tf/six.tf/two.tf          | /one.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/two.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/three.tf    | /one.tf,/nine.tf/three.tf/five.tf       |\n\nDuring the year, we expensed research and development costs amounting to DKK 2,162 million (2020: DKK 1,935 million).\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nResearch costs are costs incurred to analyse and optimise different aspects of offshore wind farm technology (e.g. improving offshore foundations and optimising blade stability and performance).\n\nResearch costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs primarly comprise salaries as well as internal and external costs which can be directly or indirectly attributed to design and development of new offshore and onshore wind farms, the Renescience Northwich plant, hydrogen production facilities, and energy storage facilities.\n\nDevelopment costs are expensed until the capitalisation criteria are met.\n\nWhen the capitalisation criteria are met, development costs are capitalised as 'Assets under construction'.",

The increase was mainly driven by gain on divestments of assets, primarily the 50 % farm-downs of Borssele 1 & 2 in May and Greater Changhua 1 in November.\n\nIn 2020, gain on divestment of assets was mainly related to the Hornsea 1 offshore transmission asset where we lowered our assumption regarding the preferred bidder's expected return requirement.\n\n'Other compensation' is primarily compensations regarding outages and curtailments from TenneT, the German grid operator.\n\nThe increase in 'US tax credits and tax attributes' was mainly due to commissioning of new onshore wind farms in 2020, which have had full impact in 2021 and commissioning of new onshore wind and solar farms in 2021.\n\n## Other operating expenses\n\n'Loss on divestment of assets' was primarily related to M&A transaction costs.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nGains from divestment of ownership interests in wind farms are recognised on the divestment date as other operating income in the income statement.\n\nGains for future construction of the partner's share of the wind farm are recognised over time in the income statement in step with the construction. See notes 2.2 'Revenue' and 3.5 'Contract assets and liabilities'.\n\nThe accounting policies for 'US tax credits and tax attributes' income are described in note 3.8 'Tax equity liabilities'.\n\n## Divestment of ownership interests in our offshore wind farms\n\nWhen we divest an ownership interest in an offshore wind farm to a partner, we typically also enter into agreements on the future  operation and construction (if not in operation) of the offshore wind farm.\n\nContracts in connection with a divestment are typically agreements on:\n\n- -  the sale of shares (divestment of/uni00A0assets) (SPA)\n- -   the future construction of the offshore wind farm (construction agreements or construction management agreements, if not in operation)\n- -   the future operation of the offshore/uni00A0wind farm (O&M agreements).\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Estimates for the variable selling price related to divestments of offshore wind farms and offshore transmission assets\n\nWhen we divest an ownership interest in an offshore wind farm and an offshore transmission asset to a partner, we consider all terms and activities in the contracts in order to determine the transaction price.\n\nIf the consideration includes a variable amount, we estimate the consideration to which we are entitled in exchange for transferring the asset, the wind farm, and the transmission asset to our partner.\n\nThe variable considerations are estimated at contract inception based on future outcome of events, e.g.:\n\n- -   the divestment price of offshore transmission asset through competitive tender process\n- -   the impact on production from future wind farms\n- -   the winning bid of tender revenue stream through a competitive tender process.\n\nWe consider 'the most likely amount' to provide the most appropriate estimate of the expected variable consideration.\n\n## Key accounting judgement\n\n## Classification of divestment\n\nWhen we divest ownership interests in an offshore wind farm, we carry out an individual assessment determining whether the divestment qualifies as a divestment of an enterprise or a divestment of assets. We have typically assessed that the offshore wind farms do not constitute an enterprise, as no employees are transferred, and processes are transferred to a limited extent only.",

As a condition for the granting of performance share units (PSUs), the participant must own a number of shares in \u00d8rsted corresponding to a portion of the individual participant's annual fixed salary. The portion depends on the employee category and, for our CEO, makes up 75 % of the fixed salary; see/uni00A0the table above for more information. The participants in the programme must invest in \u00d8rsted shares prior to the first granting.\n\nIf the participants fulfil the shareholding requirement at the time of granting, they will be granted a number of PSUs each year, representing a value of 15-20 % (15-40 % in the US) of the annual fixed salary on the date of granting.\n\nThe granted PSUs have a vesting period of approximately three years, after which each PSU entitles the holder, without payment, to receive a number of shares corresponding to 0-200 % of the number of PSUs granted. The vesting is conditional upon continued\n\nemployment. Assuming no share price development since the grant, the value would correspond to 0-30 % or 0-40 % (0-80 % in the US) of the fixed salary on the date of grant. The final number of shares for each participant will be determined on the basis of the total shareholder return delivered by \u00d8rsted, benchmarked against ten comparable European energy companies.\n\nThe highest rate (200 %) will be triggered if \u00d8rsted's results, measured as the total return to  shareholders, outperform those of the com parable companies. For each lower ranking, the number of shares granted will fall by 20 percentage points (% points). If, for example, \u00d8rsted ranks third, the participants will be entitled to/uni00A0160 % of the target.\n\nIf \u00d8rsted ranks 11 in the comparison, no shares will be granted to the participants. The right to shares is conditional upon continued employment.\n\n## Retention share programme\n\nThe target group for the share-based retention agreements will typically be employees responsible for vital, long-term projects. The use of these share-based retention agreements will be limited to 25 concurrent agreements with an individual time frame of up to five years. Members of the Executive Board (CEO, CFO, and CCO) cannot be granted such retention agreements.\n\nThe number of retention share units (RSUs) to be granted will be determined on the basis of the price of \u00d8rsted's shares at the time of the grant and will be limited to an amount corresponding to a maximum of six months' base pay for the employee in question. At vesting, each RSU will entitle the employee to one \u00d8rsted share free of charge. However, the total value of the shares to be received at vesting will be capped at a maximum of twelve months' base pay for the employee in question.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe share programme is classified as an  equity-based programme as the programme is settled in shares. The market value of the PSUs/RSUs and the  estimated number of PSUs granted are measured at the time of granting and recognised:\n\n- -   in the income statement under employee costs over the vesting period\n- -   as an offset in the balance sheet under equity over the vesting period.\n\nThe valuation of the PSUs/RSUs and the estimate of the number of PSUs/RSUs expected to be granted are carried out as a probability simulation based on \u00d8rsted's expected total shareholder return relative to ten comparable European energy companies. The expect ations are factored into the market value and are not adjusted subsequently. The participants are compensated for any dividend payments by receiving additional PSUs/RSUs.",

With the acquisition of BRI, \u00d8rsted entered the European onshore market. BRI's management team continues to run the business, which will be incorporated into our Onshore business unit over time. Since the acquisition date, BRI has contributed with a revenue of DKK 230 million and a loss after tax of DKK 68 million.\n\nIf the acquisition had been made on 1 January 2021, the revenue would have been DKK 643 million, and the loss after tax would have been DKK 89 million.\n\nAs part of the acquisition process, we have incurred costs of DKK 49 million, which have been expensed in our income statement in the Onshore segment.\n\nWe did not acquire any enterprises in 2020.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAcquisition of enterprises is recognised using the acquisition method. Under this method, assets and liabilities as well as contingent liabilities of the acquired enterprise are measured at fair value on the date of acquisition.\n\nThe fair values of production assets and assets under construction are normally determined using an income approach where they are valued at\n\npresent value based on the expected cash flows they can generate, including any non-separable power purchase agreements, and on income, such as production tax credits.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives is determined using our normal approach for such items which is based on market prices or expectations for prices over the term of the derivatives.\n\nThe fair values of other assets and liabilities are valued using the approach we find most relevant for the individual item, which can be either a market approach, an income approach, or a cost approach.\n\nAn acquired enterprise is included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which is the date when we obtain control.\n\nWhen an acquired enterprise has entered into a power purchase agreement classified as a derivative, the fair value of the agreement will be included in the opening balance. Post-acquisition, this fair value is recognised as an adjustment to revenue over the duration of the contract, based on the fair value calculation at the time of the acquisition.\n\n## Key accounting estimates\n\n## Purchase price allocations in business combinations\n\nWhen we apply the acquisition method for business combinations, by nature this involves judgement in assessing the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\n## Property, plant, and equipment\n\nOur assessment of fair value is based on a number of estimates regarding WACC and expected cash flows, which both have a large impact on the fair value.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nOur assessment of fair value is dependent on expected future prices. See note 6.6 'Fair value measurement' for our valuation principles.",

Further, we repaid DKK 183  million to Andel for the settlement of the divestment of the Danish power distribution, residental customer, and city light businesses in 2020.\n\nThe gain on divestment of enterprises was affected by a DKK 818 million increase in our indemnification provision towards INEOS in relation to the divestment of our upstream\n\noil and gas business in 2017. The provision regards a transfer pricing case with the Norwegian  Tax  Administration.\n\nIn 2020, we divested our Danish power distribution, residental customer, and city light businesses to Andel and the loss-making LNG business to Glencore.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWe recognise income from divested enterprises in the income statement up until the date of divestment.\n\nThe date of divestment is the date on which we relinquish control of the divested enterprise.\n\nGains or losses on the divestment or discontinuation of subsidiaries and associates are determined as the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the net assets divested.\n\nMoreover, we deduct any provisions made for obligations related to sales and purchase agreements and the fees of advisers, etc., in connection with the divestment or discontinuation of the enterprise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBorssele 1 & 2, near Vlissingen, the Netherlands.",

However, we have typically agreed on minimum lease payments for the seabeds, and these minimum payments are included in the lease liabilities.\n\nExpenses for the year relating to variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities were DKK 352 million in 2021 (2020: DKK 411 million). Interests on lease debt expensed in profit (loss) were DKK 261 million in 2021 (2020: DKK 177 million).\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases were DKK 1,133 million in 2021 (2020: DKK 1,129 million).\n\nWe have entered into leases of DKK 1,302 million (undiscounted) which are not commenced per 31 December 2021 and consequently not included in the balance sheet.\n\nFor maturity analysis of leases liabilities, we refer to note 5.5 'Maturity analysis of financial liabilities'.\n\n## Impairment losses\n\n## Impairment losses relating to intangible assets\n\nWe have not recognised any material impairments to goodwill or other intangible assets in 2021.\n\n## Impairment losses relating to property, plant, and equipment\n\nWe have not recognised any material impairment losses to property, plant, and equipment in 2021.\n\n## Key accounting estimates\n\n## Key assumptions in impairment tests\n\nCGUs are tested for impairment if there is any indication of impairment. The value of a CGU is impaired if the net book value exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU.\n\nValue-in-use calculations are based on expected future cash flows from financial budgets and forecasts and include a number of assumptions and estimates. These assumptions include future market conditions, market prices of power and biofuel, estimated discount rates, estimated useful lives of the projects, etc. The market prices applied are based on available forward prices for a period of up to five years and our best estimate of long-term prices for the remainder of the period.\n\nWhen calculating the recoverable amount of wind farms under construction, other material assumptions include the expected completion costs and the commissioning dates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CGUs in Offshore\n\nThe cash generating units (CGUs) are made up of individual offshore wind farms, each of which generates cash flows for the segment independently of each other.\n\n## Significan/t.ss01 CGU/s.ss01\n\nAnholt, Borkum Riffgrund /one.tf, Borkum Riffgrund /two.tf, Borkum Riffgrund /three.tf, Borssele /one.tf & /two.tf, Burbo Bank Extension, Gode Wind /one.tf, Gode Wind /two.tf, Gode Wind /three.tf, Greater Changhua /one.tf & /two.tfa, Horns Rev /two.tf, Hornsea /one.tf, Hornsea /two.tf, London Array, Ocean Wind /one.tf, Race Bank, Revolution Wind, South Fork, Sunrise Wind, Westermost Rough, Walney, Walney Extension, and West of Duddon Sands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CGUs in Onshore\n\nThe CGUs are made up of individual onshore wind and solar farms, each of which generates cash flows for the segment independently of each other.\n\n## Significan/t.ss01 CGU/s.ss01\n\nAmazon, Garracummer, Haystack, Helena Energy Center, Kennoxhead /one.tf, Lincoln Land, Lisheen /three.tf, Lockett, Muscle Shoals, Old /three.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf, Permian Energy Center, Plum Creek, Sage Draw, Tahoka, Western Trail, Willow Creek, and Willow Springs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CGUs in Bioenergy & Other\n\nThe Danish CHP plants constitute a single CGU, as overall production planning is for the entire Danish portfolio.

Rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated future useful lives, which are 5-20 years.\n\n## Property, plant, and equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment which is not a lease is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost of property, plant, and equipment is depreciated by using the straight-line method, the diminishing-balance method, or the reducing fraction method. The diminishing-balance method and the reducing-fraction method result in decreasing depreci ation over the useful life. These methods are used for some of our offshore wind farms.\n\nCosts comprise purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date the asset is available for use. The costs of self-constructed assets comprise direct and indirect costs of  materials, components, sub-suppliers, and labour. Borrowing costs relating to both specific and general borrowing directly attributable to assets under construction with a lengthy construction period are recognised in costs during the construction period. Costs are increased by the present value of the estimated obligations for demolition and decommissioning of assets to the extent that the obligations are recognised as provisions.\n\nSubsequent costs, for example in connection with replacement of parts of an item of property, plant, and equipment, are recognised in the carrying amount of the asset in question when it is  probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group from the expenses incurred. Any residual value of the replaced parts is recognised in the income statement as loss on disposal of non-current assets. Other repair and/uni00A0 maintenance expenses are recognised in profit (loss) for the year as incurred.\n\n## Leases\n\nOur lease assets are classified alongside our owned assets of similar type under property, plant and equipment. Initially, we measure a lease asset at cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. We depreciate our lease assets over the lease term. The depreciation method used is the straight-line method for all our lease assets, except for seabed leases where the depreciation method is aligned with the depreciation method for the related offshore wind farm. Therefore, seabed lease assets are depreciated by using either the straight-line method or the reducing-fraction method.\n\nOur lease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of the in-substance fixed lease payments for the use of a lease asset. If, at inception of the lease, we are reasonably certain about exercising an option to extend a lease, we will include the lease payments in the option period when calculating the lease liability. We measure the lease asset to the value of the lease liability at initial recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverview of contracts entered into where  delivery had not taken place at 31 December 2021. The obligations are measured at nominal value.\n\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. We allocate the consideration in a contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. We account for non-lease components in accordance with the accounting policy applicable for such items. Non-lease components comprise building services and operating costs of leased vessels, etc.\n\nVariable lease expenses are recognised in other external expenses in the period when the condition triggering those payments occurs. Interests of lease liabilities are recognised in financial expenses.\n\nEach lease payment is separated into repayment of the lease liability and payment of interests of the lease liability. Debt repayments are classified as cash flows from financing activities, and payment of interests are classified as cash flows from operating activities.",

Green certificates are primarily renewable obligation certificates (ROCs), which are issued to renewable energy power generators in the UK.\n\nGas at storage primarily relates to our gas trade activities.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOffshore transmission assets are measured at cost. The costs comprise costs of materials used in construction, site labour costs, costs of renting  equipment as well as indirect production costs, such as employee costs.\n\nGas storage in non-Danish facilities are managed on a fair value basis, and therefore the gas in these storage facilities is recognised at fair value less costs to sell. Changes in the fair value less costs to sell are recognised in cost of sales in the period of the change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInventories measured at fair value are disclosed in note 6.6 'Fair value measurement'.\n\nGas in Danish storage facilities are recognised at cost, determined as a weighted average of the previous months purchase price, including transport costs.\n\nPurchased carbon emission allowances are  measured at market value.\n\nGreen certificates, which we earn by generating power using renewable energy sources, are recognised in inventories in step with our generation. We/uni00A0measure green certificates (earned and bought) at cost using the first in, first out (FIFO) principle.\n\nOther inventories are measured at cost, determined on a first in, first out basis or net realisable value, if net realisable value is lower.\n\nInventories are written down to the lower of net realisable value and cost price. For offshore transmission assets, it is the expected final transfer value announced by Ofgem.\n\nThe net realisable value is the sum (discounted) which the inventories are expected to generate through a normal sale.\n\n## /three.tf./five.tf  Contract assets and liabilities\n\n| Revenue from contracts with customers,  DKKm                                     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Revenue recognised included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the year | /three.tf/two.tf/four.tf           | /six.tf/five.tf/four.tf           |\n| Revenue recognised from perfomance obligations satisfied in previous years       | -                                  | /one.tf/zero.tf/four.tf           |\n| Contract balances,  DKKm                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf    |\n| Contract assets                                                                  |                                    |                                   |\n| Current contract assets                                                          | /two.tf                            | /three.tf/zero.tf                 |\n| Total contract assets                                                            | /two.tf                            | /three.tf/zero.tf                 |\n| Contract liabilities                                                             |                                    |                                   |\n| Non-current contract liabilities                                                 | /three.tf,/two.tf/three.tf/zero.tf | /three.tf,/six.tf/five.tf/zero.tf |\n| Current contract liabilities                                                     | /two.tf,/four.tf/four.tf/zero.tf   | /four.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf         |\n| Total contract liabilities                                                       | /five.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf  | /four.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/zero.tf |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContract assets and contract liabilities are primarily related to:\n\n- -  the construction of offshore wind farms with partners, with each party typically owning 50 % of the offshore wind farm\n- -  prepayments from heat customers.\n\nNon-current contract liabilities primarily relate to prepayments from heat customers.\n\nAt the end of 2021, current contract liabilities relates to the construction of the Greater Changhua 1.\n\nThe table shows the amount of our revenue relating to contract liabilities carried forward (as prepayments and deferred revenue) and the amount relating to performance obligations satisfied in a prior year (e.g. renegotiations or constraints on variable consider ations that are not recognised until they are highly probable).\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWe recognise a contract asset when we perform a service or transfer goods in advance of receiving consideration, and the consideration is conditional.

The discount rate used is the effective interest rate for the individual receivable or the individual portfolio.\n\nWe apply the simplified approach to the write-down of trade receivables, which permits calculating the write-down as the full loss during the entire term of the receivable.\n\n## /three.tf./seven.tf  Other receivables and other payables\n\n| Other receivables,  DKKm                                                            | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf               | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Receivables from the divestment of assets and  enterprises                          | /eight.tf/nine.tf                           | /one.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/four.tf    |\n| Receivables from the divestment of equity  investments to non-controlling interests | /seven.tf/five.tf/seven.tf                  | /seven.tf/four.tf/two.tf           |\n| Collateral provided                                                                 | /one.tf/one.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf     | /four.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf          |\n| VAT and other indirect tax receivables                                              | /nine.tf/one.tf/three.tf                    | /seven.tf/two.tf/five.tf           |\n| Prepayments                                                                         | /seven.tf/four.tf/two.tf                    | /five.tf/five.tf/six.tf            |\n| Deposits                                                                            | /five.tf/seven.tf/two.tf                    | /three.tf/one.tf/two.tf            |\n| Other                                                                               | /two.tf,/three.tf/two.tf/five.tf            | /one.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/eight.tf  |\n| Total other receivables                                                             | /one.tf/seven.tf,/three.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf | /five.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/five.tf   |\n| Of which, working capital                                                           | /one.tf/one.tf,/nine.tf/six.tf/two.tf       | /three.tf,/two.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf |\n| Of which, other capital employed                                                    | /four.tf/three.tf/eight.tf                  | /one.tf,/five.tf/nine.tf/three.tf  |\n| Of which, interest-bearing net debt                                                 | /four.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf          | /seven.tf/five.tf/four.tf          |\n\n| Other payables,  DKKm                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf    |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| M&A related liabilities              | /three.tf,/four.tf/three.tf/six.tf  | /four.tf/eight.tf                 |\n| Accrued interest                     | /one.tf,/six.tf/eight.tf/five.tf    | /one.tf,/five.tf/two.tf/seven.tf  |\n| Collateral received                  | /eight.tf                           | /one.tf,/eight.tf/six.tf/two.tf   |\n| Salary-related items payable         | /five.tf/five.tf/zero.tf            | /eight.tf/six.tf/seven.tf         |\n| VAT and other indirect taxes payable | /five.tf/three.tf/three.tf          | /three.tf/five.tf/nine.tf         |\n| Carbon rights                        | /one.tf/five.tf/four.tf             | /four.tf/three.tf                 |\n| Other deferred income                | /three.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf          | -                                 |\n| Other                                | /two.tf,/six.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf   | /one.tf,/seven.tf/five.tf/zero.tf |\n| Total other payables                 | /nine.tf,/four.tf/five.tf/zero.tf   | /six.tf,/four.tf/five.tf/six.tf   |\n| Of which, working capital            | /three.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/one.tf | /two.tf,/nine.tf/six.tf/five.tf   |\n| Of which, other capital employed     | /five.tf,/one.tf/six.tf/one.tf      | /one.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/one.tf    |\n| Of which, interest-bearing net debt  | /five.tf/one.tf/eight.tf            | /one.tf,/eight.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe collateral provided by the Group is receivables from banks in connection with hedging activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe collateral received by the Group is cash received from banks in connection with hedging of derivatives.",

During 2021, we commissioned the onshore wind farm Western Trail, and the two solar projects Permian Energy Center and Muscle Shoals, and we received tax equity contributions from our partners. We also received a tax equity contribution for Haystack (an onshore wind farm with expected commissioning in 2022). In addition, we acquired Lincoln Land, an operational onshore wind farm, including a tax equity liability.\n\n## Description of tax equity partnerships\n\nTax equity partnerships are characterised by a tax equity partner who contributes an upfront payment as part of the initial project investment and does not have an operational role in the project. The partner receives a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, we have thirteen onshore wind and solar farms and one offshore wind farm for which we have received tax equity contributions.\n\ncontractually agreed return on the contribution. In order to 'repay' the initial contribution and the return, a disproportionate share of the production tax credits (PTCs) or the investment tax credits (ITCs) and other tax attributes (accelerated tax depreciation and other taxable results) are allocated to the partner during the first part of the project's lifetime. The partner also receives some cash payment-based percentages specified in the partnership agreements. Once the partner receives the agreed return, the agreement flips, and the partner is typically entitled to a minor part of the cash distributions from the project, unless we repurchase this right from them, which is highly likely.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWhen a tax equity partnership is formed, we evaluate if the company should still be fully consolidated based on our right to variable returns as well as our ability to exercise influence on financial and operational  decisions impacting those returns. Due to the operational and financial nature of the projects and the influence normally given to tax equity partners in such agreements, we normally have the  influence to fully consolidate companies that have tax equity partners.\n\nThe terms of the tax equity partner's contribution are evaluated to determine the accounting treatment. The contribution generally has the characteristics of a liability as the initial contribution is repaid, including an agreed return, and the partner does not share in the risks of the project in the same way as a shareholder. As such, the contribution is accounted for as a liability and measured at amortised cost. The liability is based on the expected method of repayment and is divided into:\n\n- -   a net working capital element to be repaid through PTCs/ITCs and other tax attributes\n- -   an interest-bearing debt element expected to be repaid through cash distributions.\n\nThe partner's agreed return is expensed as a financial expense and is recognised as an increase of the tax equity liability. PTCs and other tax attributes transferred to the tax equity partner are recognised as other operating income. Tax attributes allocated to the tax equity partner are deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated contractual length of the partnership structure, while PTCs are recognised in the periods earned, similar to recognition of our own PTCs. ITCs, typically associated with solar farms, are recognised on a straight-line basis over the flip period (partner's ITCs) or life of the asset (our own ITCs).\n\nIn addition to the above, we recognise a liability for the expected purchase price for the partner's post-flip rights to cash distributions. This liability is recognised at fair value, and adjustments are expensed as a financial item. This recognition reflects the intention and high  likelihood that we will purchase the partner's post-flip rights, and they are part of the financial costs of the arrangement.\n\nIf we choose not to buy the partner's post-flip rights, the tax equity partner will be entitled to part of the company's returns in the post-flip period. At that point, the partner will share in the risks and rewards in the company as a shareholder and will be considered a non-controlling interest.\n\n## Key accounting judgements\n\n## Recognition of tax equity partners\n\nOn formation of a tax equity partnership, we assess the appropriate recognition of the partner's contribution as well as the method of recognition for the elements used to repay the partner, such as PTCs and tax attributes.\n\nIn assessing the recognition of the partner's contribution, we look at:\n\n- -   the expected flows of PTCs, tax attributes, and cash payments to the partner\n- -   the rights and obligations of both us and the tax equity partner.\n\nThe deferral of the income related to tax attributes and the recognition of the contribution as working capital or interest-bearing debt are affected by our expectation to the size, method, and timing of repayments.",

        "page_content": "## Contingent liabilities Liability to pay compensation\n\nIn case of any environmental accidents or other types of damage caused by our gas and oil transport, the companies \u00d8rsted Salg & Service A/S and Danish Oil Pipe A/S are liable to pay compensation according to legislation. This also applies if there is no proof of negligence (strict liability). We have taken out insurance to cover any such claims.\n\n## Secondary liability\n\nAs part of the divestment of our oil and gas business in 2017, we assumed a secondary liability regarding the decommissioning of offshore installations.\n\n## Litigation\n\nWe are party to a number of court cases and legal disputes. In our assessment, none of these will significantly impact \u00d8rsted's financial position, neither individually nor collectively. We have been party to actions relating to the Danish competition authorities' claim that the former Elsam A/S and Elsam Kraft A/S ('Elsam'), now part of \u00d8rsted, charged excessive prices in the Danish wholesale power market in the period 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2006.\n\nThere are no longer any outstanding cases with the competition authorities claiming Elsam infringed competition law, but in connection with the former cases, some energy trading companies, some of their customers, and others have filed claims for damages which are still pending.\n\nThe biggest claim was filed in 2007 before the  Copenhagen Maritime & Commercial Court, amounting to approx. DKK 4.4 billion with addition of litigation interest. In a ruling from March 2020, Elsam was acquitted from the claim, but the plaintiffs have appealed the ruling, and in September 2021 the High Court of Western Denmark overturned the decision and referred the case back to the Maritime & Commercial Court for further preparation and a new ruling on the plaintiffs claim for damages. We have asked for the permission to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court because we think the ruling concerns matters of principle.\n\n\u00d8rsted is involved in ongoing transfer pricing disputes. For further information, we refer to section 4.1 'Approach to taxes'.\n\n## Change of control\n\nSome of our activities are subject to consents, permits, and licences granted by public authorities. We may be faced with a claim for acceptance of any transfer, possibly with additional terms and conditions, if the Danish State holds less than 50 % of the share capital or voting rights in \u00d8rsted A/S. Read more in note 5.1 'Interest-bearing debt and FFO'.\n\n## Key accounting estimates\n\n## Assumptions for provisions\n\nWe continually assess our provisions recognised to cover contractual obligations and claims raised against \u00d8rsted. Timing, probabilities, amounts, etc., which have a bearing on our provisions' estimates are updated quarterly based on our expectations.\n\nEstimates of provisions are based on our expectations of, for example:\n\n- -   timing and scope of obligation\n- -   future cost level\n- -legal  assessment.\n\nIf deemed material, non-current provisions are discounted using either the structural risk-free interest rate or the incremental borrowing rate. The structural risk-free interest rate is used for decommissioning liabilities and onerous contracts. It is calculated as the sum of real return (Gross Domestic Product growth rate), inflation, and inflation premium for other risks. Separate structural risk-free interest rates are calculated for Europe, the US, and Taiwan.\n\nThe outcome of our contractual obligations and claims may depend on future events which are uncertain by nature.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the following criteria/uni00A0are  fulfilled:\n\n- -   We have a legal or constructive obligation as a result of an earlier event.\n- -   The settlement of the obligation is expected to result in an outflow of resources.\n- -   The obligation can be measured reliably.\n\nDecommissioning obligations are measured at the present value of the future liability in respect of decommissioning as expected at the balance sheet date. The present value of the provision and changes in estimate are recognised as part of the cost of prop erty, plant, and equipment and depreciated together with the associated asset. The addition of interest on provisions is recognised in the income statement under financial expenses.\n\nFor onerous contracts, a provision is made when the expected income to be derived from a contract is lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting our obligations under the contract.\n\nProvisions concerning carbon emissions are recognised when our actual emissions exceed our holding of carbon emission allowances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "|\n\n## /four.tf./one.tf Approach to taxes\n\nIn \u00d8rsted, we want to provide user-friendly information about our tax positions. We do this by reporting transparently from a global perspective and engaging in mutually beneficial dialogues with our stakeholders.\n\nWe believe that taxes are a core part of our corporate social responsibility. At \u00d8rsted, we are committed to conducting our business in a way that contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Taxes are a key contribution to the SDGs, in particular target 16.6 on the development of effective, accountable, and transparent institutions.\n\nTaxes are overseen by the Board of Directors, which is accountable for the tax policy. The responsibility for tax risk management lies with the CFO and is overseen by the Audit & Risk Committee. The day-to-day tax management is handled by a centralised global tax team, which is involved in all significant business developments.\n\nWe have a clear responsibility to comply with the laws in the countries where we operate. We choose to do this by aiming to comply not only with the letter of the law, but also with the underlying tax policy intent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur colleagues in Gentofte, Denmark.\n\nThe GRI 207: Tax standard has been adopted with effect for reports published after 1 January 2021. For the second year in a row, we have drawn inspiration from the standard when presenting our approach to and reporting of tax. We continuously evaluate the need of our stakeholders and strive to engage actively with them. This is facilitated by increasing the transparency of our reporting in a standardised manner, allowing us to continue dialogue and cooperation with our stakeholders.\n\nManagement has been provided with a statement (ISRS 4400 - Agreed Upon Procedures) from our auditors on our application of GRI 207: Tax.\n\n## Tax stakeholder engagement\n\nIn line with our tax policy, we engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups, and civil  society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation, and administration.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued engagement and collaboration with NGO's and legislators globally. Primarily, this included involvement in the development of legislation concerning the Danish CFC rules, which was adopted by the Danish parliament on 3 June. We have participated in meetings of the Confederation of Danish Industry's tax panel and participated in the B Team's responsible tax working group.\n\nThe purpose of our engagement is to support the development of robust and sustainable tax legislation and practice by contributing to an informed discussion. By engaging with civil society and gathering input on, for example, how we share information, we believe we can contribute to increasing the public's confidence in the corporate tax system.\n\n## Tax risk management and controls\n\nComplying with tax rules can be complex, as the interpretation of legislation and case law may not always be clear cut and may change over time, giving rise to tax risks. We manage our tax risks by the prevention of unnecessary disputes, which we strive to achieve through strong technical positions, clear explanations of our positions, thorough documentation, and strong compliance procedures and by engaging in up-front dialogue with the tax authorities.\n\nWe define a tax risk as any consequence relating to the application of our tax policy, day-to-day operations, compliance, or external reporting that impacts the business in form of cash liabilities, financial statement errors or misstatements, or reputational damage.\n\nTo ensure a coordinated assessment of tax risks, \u00d8rsted's tax function is involved in the planning, implementation, and documentation of all significant new processes.",

        "page_content": "|\n\nOur risk appetite is governed by the 'more likely than not' approach.\n\nFor more details on our approach to taxes, we refer to our tax policy which can be found here: orsted.com/taxpolicy.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nOccasionally, a multinational enterprise like \u00d8rsted faces potential double taxation. This occurs when two tax jurisdictions seek to tax the same business income. We believe that profit should only be taxed once in line with the position of the OECD.\n\nOur tax risk management work includes considering uncertain tax positions, e.g. when we have taken a position where there is an uncertainty created by a comparison of the wording of the law, the expressed policy intent or lack thereof, or fluctuating or divergent application by tax authorities or judicial systems in the countries where we operate.\n\nIn response to the tax risks connected to crossborder activities, including the controversies described in this section, we have made tax-related provisions in accordance with IAS 12, IAS 37, and relevant interpretation, such as IFRIC 23. The provisions have been calculated on the basis of differences in tax rates and statistical risks of suffering economic or legal double taxation\n\n## Tax controversies in Denmark\n\nOn 29 November 2021, \u00d8rsted received a final administrative decision from the Danish Tax Agency in relation to the development of the offshore wind farm Race Bank. In line with its administrative decision from 1 December\n\n2020 on the Hornsea 1 and Walney Extension offshore wind farms, the Danish Tax Agency claims that \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S has not acted at arm's length terms when charging fees for technical development services provided to the Race Bank project company. In its decision, the Danish Tax Agency increases \u00d8rsted Wind Power A/S's tax payment to Denmark by DKK 2.5 billion for the income year 2015.\n\nWe have appealed the administrative decision to the Danish Tax Tribunal and will consider our further options, including an elaborated appeal to the Danish Tax Tribunal, a direct appeal to the court system, or a request for a mutual agreement procedure (MAP) under the double tax agreement between Denmark and the United Kingdom. The Danish Tax Agency has accepted a deferral of the tax payment until the case has been finally decided.\n\n## Tax controversies in Norway\n\nOn 29 November 2021, the Norwegian Tax Administration (NTA) issued a draft reassessment regarding transfer pricing of sale of gas during the years 2007-2011. The NTA proposes a reassessment of NOK 2.4 billion, which would be subject to hydrocarbon taxation at 78 % corresponding to NOK 1.9 billion. The company receiving the reassessment was sold to INEOS in 2017 as a part of the divestment of the oil and gas activities. However, under the Sales & Purchase Agreement, \u00d8rsted has the risk for tax matters relating to our ownership period.\n\nThe draft reassessment has caused us to reassess our provisions for legacy Norwegian tax matters, and we have decided to increase our provisions in relation to this, which is\n\nrecognised as 'Gain (loss) on divestment of enterprises'.\n\nOnce a final reassessment is received, any tax becomes payable immediately - it is not possible to receive a stay or deferral. Together with our lawyers and advisers, we are assessing appropriate and alternative courses of action, including an appeal process in the Norwegian court system or a mutual agreement procedure between Denmark and Norway.\n\n## Tax controls\n\nWithin \u00d8rsted, the main control is our four-eye review principle. This means that our controls are continuously reviewed and assessed and, where applicable, substituted by automated data input. Tax decisions in relation to matters which are subjected to approval by management are approved by the Head of Tax.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAved\u00f8re Power Station, Hvidovre, Denmark.\n\n## Tax planning and use of tax incentives\n\nWe only use business structures that are driven by commercial considerations and aligned with business activity. We do not use so-called secrecy jurisdictions or tax havens to avoid taxes. If we establish an entity in a low or nil-rate jurisdiction, it will be for substantive and commercial reasons. We pay tax on profits according to where value is created. In order to remain competitive, we make use of incentives and tax relief implemented by governments where we have commercial substance.",

The effective tax rate was 18 % in 2021 against 10 % in 2020.\n\nThe effective tax rate was primarily affected by the largely tax-exempt divestments of the offshore wind farms Borssele 1 & 2 and Greater Changhua 1. Further, changes to the corporate tax rate in the UK impacted our net deferred tax assets. Another primary factor derived from recognition of tax liabilities in connection with capitalisation of project costs in the US where we have entered into tax equity agreement on the following projects:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHaystack\n\nWestern Trail\n\nMuscle Shoals\n\nPermian Energy Center\n\nNorth-east cluster\n\nOcean Wind 1\n\nSee more regarding tax equity partnerships in notes 3.8 'Tax equity liabilities' and 4.3  'Deferred tax'\n\nThe movement in uncertain tax positions is a consequence of management's reassessment of uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTax for the year consists of current tax, changes in deferred tax, and adjustments in respect of previous years. Tax on profit (loss) for the year is recognised in the income statement. Tax relating to other items is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nLiabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions are measured as follows:\n\n- -   The most-likely-outcome method is applied in cases where there are only two possible outcomes.\n- -   The weighted-average method is used in cases where there are more than two possible outcomes.\n\nThe liability is recognised under 'Income tax' or ' Deferred tax', depending on how the realisation of the tax position will affect the financial statement.\n\nThe adjustment of tax concerning previous years primarily relates to consortium relief payments for utilisation of tax losses in the UK as per agreement with our joint venture partners.\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2020 was primarily affected by the largely tax-exempt sale of our Danish power distribution business and related activities as well as recognition of a tax liability in connection with tax equity partnerships in the US related to the onshore wind farms Sage Draw, Plum Creek, and Willow Creek.\n\n## Key accounting estimate\n\n## Estimates regarding recognition of income taxes\n\n\u00d8rsted is subject to income taxes in all the countries where we operate. Significant judgement and estimates are required in determining the worldwide income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nIn the course of conducting business around the world, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business. Judgement is applied to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. We apply the methods prescribed in IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments' when making provisions for uncertain tax positions, and the provisions made are based on different scenarios of possible outcomes. We consider the provisions made to be adequate. The actual obligation may deviate and might lead to tax in excess of the uncertain tax provisions included. This  depends on the result of litigations and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.\n\nOngoing tax disputes, primarily related to transfer pricing cases, are included as part of 'Income tax' and 'Deferred tax'. Estimates in respect of transfer pricing cases depend, among others, on whether corresponding adjustments can be obtained in the relevant jurisdictions, and, in terms of disputes regarding project companies with partners, whether compensation can be obtained from these partners. Any expected compensation from partners are included as part of 'Other receivables'.",

        "page_content": "|\n\n## Tax on profit (loss) for the year and other comprehensive income\n\nIn 2021, total tax for the year amounted to an income of DKK 4,145 million, consisting of tax on profit (loss) for the year, tax on other comprehensive income, and tax on hybrid capital related to equity.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the payable tax expense incurred by \u00d8rsted on profit for the year. This differs from taxes paid as a result of payments or refunds regarding prior years and residual payments for the current year.\n\nBecause of the high level of investments and the subsequent deferrals of payable tax as a consequence of accelerated tax depreciation, our current tax is generally lower than the statutory corporate tax rates during construction and the initial years after first power from a wind farm. The current tax for 2021 has decreased compared to 2020 due to mark-to-market taxation of certain financial instruments, which means that unrealised losses on hedges are included in the taxable income.\n\nTax on other comprehensive income for 2021 is a significant income due to the skyrocketing power prices and a high volatility in the gas and power markets in the second half of 2021. The increase in gas and power prices lead to large, unrealised losses on hedges which are\n\nbooked on equity and therefore not included in the profit (loss) statement. Under Danish tax rules, most of the profit (loss) on hedges are taxed according to the mark-to-market principle, which means that the market value adjustment is always included in the taxable income, despite the fact that the value adjustment has not been realised. Our Danish tax return for 2021 will therefore reflect the tax related to the unrealised losses incurred on the hedges and result in a tax loss carryforward. Subsequent reductions in power and gas prices will conversely lead to an increase in market value on the hedges, resulting in an increase of taxable income not included in the profit (loss) statement.\n\nTax on hybrid capital related to equity is from refinancing of hybrid capital in February 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe figure shows the effective tax rates in the main countries where we operate. The effective tax rate is mainly impacted by: for Denmark: the tax exempt divestment of Greater Changhua 1 and reassessment of uncertain tax positions; for the UK: changes to the corporate tax rate from 19 % to 25 %; for the US: recognition of tax liabilities in connection with tax equity arrangements in combindation with the tax loss position; for the Netherlands: tax-exempt divestment of Borssele 1 & 2; for Taiwan: the difference in tax rates when including activity for one-line consolidation purposes, and for Ireland: the partial non-recognition of pre-\u00d8rsted ownership losses.\n\n| Income tax,  DKKm                                                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year                                | (/two.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf) | (/one.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/six.tf)  |\n| Tax on other comprehensive income                                | /six.tf,/four.tf/four.tf/eight.tf   | /four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf            |\n| Tax on hybrid capital related to equity                          | /eight.tf/seven.tf                  | -                                    |\n| Total tax for the year                                           | /four.tf,/one.tf/four.tf/five.tf    | (/one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/six.tf)   |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year can be broken down as follows: |                                     |                                      |\n| Current tax                                                      | (/one.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/two.tf)  | (/two.tf,/seven.tf/three.tf/five.tf) |\n| Deferred tax                                                     | /two.tf/six.tf/nine.tf              | /one.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/five.tf     |\n| Changes in tax rates                                             | /nine.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf          | /one.tf/three.tf/eight.tf            |\n| Uncertain tax positions                                          | /five.tf/three.tf/four.tf           | (/one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf)             |\n| Tax on hybrid capital                                            | /one.tf/zero.tf/five.tf             | /one.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf             |\n| Tax equity                                                       | (/two.tf,/two.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf) | (/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf)          |\n| Adjustment of tax concerning previous years                      | (/four.tf/seven.tf/six.tf)          | /eight.tf/three.tf                   |\n| Tax on profit (loss) for the year                                | (/two.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf) | (/one.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/six.tf)  |\n| Tax on other comprehensive income can be broken down as follows: |                                     |                                      |\n| Current tax                                                      | (/three.tf/one.tf)                  | /four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf            |\n| Deferred tax                                                     | /six.tf,/four.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf   | -                                    |\n| Tax on other comprehensive income                                | /six.tf,/four.tf/four.tf/eight.tf   | /four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf            |\n\n## Effective tax rate, /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf, %\n\n<!-- image -->",

The effect primarily related to the increase in tax rate in the UK, the tax loss carryforwards in Denmark resulting from the unrealised losses on hedges, and development services provided to our activities in the UK, Germany, and Taiwan. This increase was partly offset by consortium relief payments for utilisation of tax losses in the UK as per agreement with our joint venture partners. The recognition of the deferred tax liability increased because of financial instruments adjustments as well as our tax equity partnerships as specified in note 4.2 'Tax on profit (loss) for the year'.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## US tax equity partnerships\n\nWe have entered into several tax equity partnership agreements in the US.\n\nThe expected value of the deferred tax liability related to property, plant, and equipment at the flip date in the tax equity partnership agreement is included in our accounts when the tax equity partnership agreement is effective, and we start to or have capitalised the corresponding assets. The deferred tax liability from existing tax equity partnerships will be gradually reduced based on accounting depreciation after the flip date.

As the accelerated depreciation is larger than our taxable profits when we make large investments, our tax loss carryforwards increase when more wind farms enter into operation. The tax loss carryforwards are either offset against deferred tax liabilities on the same wind farm or jurisdiction or offset against expected future profits from the very same wind farm or jurisdiction.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to:\n\n- -   the acquisition of joint operations, including licence interests\n- -   other items where differences arise at the time of acquisition, affecting neither the profit (loss) for the year nor the taxable income. However, this does not include differences arising in connection with company acquisitions.\n\n| Development in deferred tax assets   and liabilities, /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf,  DKKm   | Deferred tax  balances  at /one.tf January, net   | Movements                            | Deferred tax balances  at /three.tf/one.tf December, net   | Assets                                   | Liabilities                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Intangible assets                                                                            | (/four.tf/seven.tf)                               | /seven.tf                            | (/four.tf/zero.tf)                                         | -

We offset tax assets and liabilities when the tax assets can be offset against tax liabilities in the year in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be used. Intra-group gains and losses are eliminated when calculating deferred tax. In countries where taxes can be offset between companies due to joint taxation schemes, we have netted within a tax jurisdiction. Where no such possibility is feasible, the deferred tax is included with the gross amount on a company by company level.\n\nTax losses carried forward in jurisdictions where we have a history of losses are recognised based on other convincing evidence of future profits.\n\nDeferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and rates applying when the deferred tax becomes current tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognised in profit (loss) for the year.\n\nDeferred tax (net liabilities) related to the tax equity structures are recognised as tax expense in the income statement when the tax equity partnership agreement is effective, and we start to or have capitalised the corresponding assets. The liability recognised is the amount that we expect to take over once the contribution from the equity partner is repaid, and the tax equity structure flips.",

We also had a settlement of receivable tax of DKK 135 million. Other taxes related to prior years amounted to DKK 174 million, primarily relating to settling of group relief in the UK. We expect to have a refund of DKK 600 million regarding 2021, primarily due to unrealised losses on hedge reserves for power hedges booked on equity, especially during the second half of 2021, subject to finalisation of our 2021 tax returns.\n\n## Local taxes paid\n\nWe have made significant investments in offshore wind farms in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, the US, and Taiwan, resulting in the accumulation of large tax assets in recent years. Accordingly, we have not paid significant taxes in these countries historically. This is changing as the offshore wind farms are being commissioned and generating positive taxable income, resulting currently in paid taxes in the UK, Germany, and Taiwan. We expect to start paying corporate tax in the Netherlands in 2022.\n\nWe are also continuously investing in the US; however, we do expect to pay material tax in the US going forward due to the change in tax incentives from 2025 and due to the commercial structural set-up in the US.\n\nIn 2021, we have acquired operating activities in Ireland. We expect to pay corporate taxes in Ireland regarding these operating activities going forward. Also, we have acquired offshore development activities in Poland where we currently incur tax losses.\n\n## A wind farm life cycle\n\n\u00d8rsted operates in several countries (see our global footprint in the management's review). The design of the individual tax regime in each jurisdiction impacts the tax over the life cycle of our investments and thereby the timing of our tax payments.\n\nA wind farm life cycle begins with the development phase. This includes opportunity screening, if applicable, bid preparation, obtaining land rights, grid connection, and permits. The latter activities are further matured if an investment decision is made, and the construction phase commences, which includes construction of the wind farm. During both phases, product, people, and property taxes are borne or collected (see our total tax contribution section).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur colleagues in Gentofte, Denmark.",

        "page_content": "|\n\nWhen the wind farm is commissioned and put into operation, income and positive cash flows are generated. In many cases, the effect of tax incentives results in a deferral of taxable income compared to profit before tax for accounting purposes. Conversely, once the deferral ends, the taxable income related to the wind farm will exceed the accounting profit.\n\nFor this reason, the applicable corporate tax rate and cash tax paid will always differ, but accumulated over the lifetime of the wind farm, they will be identical.\n\nAlso, in many of the jurisdictions where we operate, there are mandatory or voluntary tax groupings. This means that we will only\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npay tax on the consolidated result of all of our activities in that country. As a result, continued significant investments in such a country may further defer the time at which we pay taxes in that country.",

This means a payment paid by \u00d8rsted to the government, including amounts paid through an agent. Tax does not result in a return of value to \u00d8rsted for a right or asset used in the business.\n\nTaxes borne by \u00d8rsted are those that represent a direct cost and are reflected in the financial result.

This information can be compared with our total tax contribution. Our tax contributions reflect that some of our development and construction activities have been based in Denmark, and that our operations in the coming years are beginning to ramp up in markets that have been developed. Also, our presence and the corresponding tax position is affected by hedging, which is primarily handled centrally in Denmark\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table shows our profit (loss) before tax in tax jurisdictions and the journey to current tax.

Capital structure\n\nAn appropriate capital structure is important to ensure we have the ability to raise new debt with attractive terms.\n\nIn February, we successfully issued two new green hybrid capital securities consisting of a EUR 500 million (DKK 3,719 million) hybrid bond and a GBP 425 million (DKK 3,765 million) hybrid bond. In February, we also redeemed EUR 350 million (DKK 2.603 million) of our 3013 hybrid capital bond. Furthermore, we have entered into loan commitments with European Investment Bank (EIB) and Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) of EUR 500 million (DKK 3,719 million) and EUR 175 million (DKK 1,302 million), respectively, which have not been drawn yet.\n\nFinally, we temporarily increased our shortterm debt through the use of repo loans related to the posting of collateral and margin payments for the negative value of hedging instruments towards the end of the year. These payments will reverse if power and gas prices return to more normal levels, or if the hedges are balanced by correspondingly higher revenue from generation of power.\n\nWe have also replaced our existing EUR 1.4 billion revolving credit facility with a new EUR 2.0 billion (DKK 14.9 billion) green revolving credit facility and entered into an additional DKK 3 billion revolving credit facility.\n\nIn the coming years, we expect to raise new debt to partly fund our DKK 350 billion investment programme covering the period 2020-2027.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nTo ensure the financial strength to operate in the international energy and capital markets and secure financing on attractive terms, we have defined credit rating and capital  structure targets. The overarching capital structure targets are a credit rating of Baa1/BBB+ and a FFO/adjusted net debt credit metric of around 25 % (previously 30 %). In 2021, we have adjusted our definition of FFO and adjusted net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) to better align with the rating agencies. Generally, we are now adjusting FFO for the cash flow effects instead of the profit and loss effects. Further, adjusted NIBD no longer includes the decommissioning obligation.\n\nEquity and net interest-bearing debt, DKKbn\n\n- Net interest-bearing debt Hybrid capital\n- Equity attributable to shareholders in \u00d8rsted A/S Non-controlling interests\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financing policy\n\nThe aim of our financing policy is to minimise liquidity and refinancing risks, while minimising financing costs and matching the currency composition of our debt with our revenue.\n\nThe financing activities are diversified among various funding sources and maturities and are primarily consolidated in the parent company, where cash resources are made available to the Group companies via an internal bank.\n\n## Cash management\n\nOne of the most significant cash management objectives is to secure sufficient and flexible financial resources in relation to our dayto-day operations, investment programme, and debt maturity profile. Therefore, we define minimum financial resources for the coming calendar year. We maintain robust financial resources to limit the company's sensitivity to unrest in the financial markets.\n\n## 31.3 %\n\nFunds from operations (FFO) relative to adjusted net interest-bearing debt amounted to 31.3 % at/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2021 against 65 % at 31 December 2020.\n\n## 24.3 bn\n\nOur net interest-bearing debt totalled DKK 24,280 million at 31 December 2021 against DKK 12,343 million at 31 December 2020.\n\n## 43.2 bn\n\nOur financial resources totalled DKK 43,183 million at 31/uni00A0December 2021 against DKK 45,642 million at 31 December 2020.",

The increase in interest-bearing net debt consists of an increase in interest-bearing debt of DKK 15,911 million and an increase in interest bearing assets of DKK/uni00A03,974/uni00A0million.\n\nIn September, we have signed a EUR 500 million (DKK 3,719 million) loan agreement with European Investment Bank.\n\nIn November, we signed a EUR 175 million (DKK 1,301 million) loan agreement with Nordic Investment Bank.\n\n## Rating\n\nWe have a corporate credit rating of BBB+/ Baa1, stable outlook, from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch, which is in line with our\n\ntarget.

Our financing agreements are not subject to any other unusual terms or conditions.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBond debt, bank debt, and other payables are recognised at inception at market value (typically proceeds received) net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, the liabilities are measured at amortised cost, so that the difference between the cost (proceeds) and the nominal value is recognised in profit (loss) for the year as interest expenses over the term of the loan, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as current, unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability to at least one year after the balance sheet date.\n\nThe market value of issued bonds has been determined as the market value at 31 December (level 1 - quoted prices).\n\nThe market value of bank loans has been determined as the present value of expected future instalments and interest payments using the Group's current interest rate on loans as the discount rate (level 2 - observable inputs).\n\n## Maturity profile of issued bonds and bank debt, DKK billion\n\n- Issued bonds\n- Bank debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to senior bonds, we have issued a number of hybrid bonds, see note 5.3 'Hybrid capital'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe majority of our bonds expire in 2031 or later.

Deferred coupon payments become payable, however, if we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders or pay coupon payments on other hybrid bonds.\n\nAs a consequence of the special terms regarding the hybrid bonds, these are classified as equity, and therefore coupon payments are recognised in equity.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nHybrid capital comprises issued bonds that qualify for treatment in accordance with the rules on compound financial instruments due to the special characteristics of the bonds. The notional amount, which constitutes a liability, is recognised at present value, and equity\n\nhas been increased by the difference between the net proceeds received and the present value of the discounted liability. Accordingly, any coupon payments are accounted for as dividends, which are recognised directly in equity at the time the payment obligation arises. This is because the coupon is discretionary, and therefore any deferred coupon lapses upon maturity of the hybrid capital. Consequently, coupon payments do not have any effect on profit (loss) for the year.\n\nThe part of the hybrid capital that is accounted for as a liability is measured at amortised cost. However, as the carrying amount of this component amounted to nil on initial recognition and due to the 1,000-year term of the hybrid capital, amortisation charges will only have an impact on profit (loss) for the year towards the end of the 1,000-year term of the hybrid capital. Coupon payments are recognised in the statement of cash flows in the same way as dividend payments within financing activities.\n\nOn redemption of hybrid capital, the payment will be distributed between liability and equity,  applying the same principles as used when the hybrid capital was issued. This means that the  difference between the payment on redemption and the net proceeds received on issue is recognised directly in equity, as the debt portion of the existing hybrid issues will be nil during the first part of the life of the hybrid capital.\n\nOn the date when the Board of Directors decides to exercise an option to redeem hybrid capital, the part of the hybrid capital that will be redeemed will be reclassified to loans and borrowings. The reclassification will be made at the market value of the hybrid capital on the date the decision is made. Coupon payments and exchange rate adjustments following the reclassification to loans and borrowings will be recognised in profit (loss) for the year as financial income or expenses.\n\nDue in /three.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\nDue in /three.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\nSubordinate to other creditors\n\nDKK /three.tf,/seven.tf/zero.tf/one.tf million\n\nEquity\n\nEUR /five.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf milllion (DKK /three.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/nine.tf million)\n\nFebruary /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\nFebruary /three.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\nLuxembourg\n\n/one.tf/eight.tf Februar /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/one.tf\n\nSubordinate to other creditors\n\nDKK /three.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/five.tf million\n\nEquity\n\nGBP /four.tf/two.tf/five.tf million (DKK /three.tf,/seven.tf/six.tf/five.tf million)\n\nFebruary /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\nFebruary /three.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf\n\nLuxembourg\n\n/one.tf/eight.tf February /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/three.tf",

Through our risk  management, we monitor these risks and reduced them to an  acceptable level.\n\n## Volatile energy prices in 2021\n\nIt has been an extraordinary year for the energy markets. It started with the unprecedented winter storm in Texas where extremely low temperatures caused a short period in February with extremely high power prices of up to USD 9,000 per MWh and ended with the European energy crunch where gas and power prices increased significantly in the last four months of the year.\n\nOur current hedging policy implies that the majority of our expected energy price exposure within the first two years is hedged. Therefore, we are only impacted to a limited extent by short-term price fluctuations.\n\n## Trading portfolio\n\nWe have a limited trading portfolio with the main purpose of optimising the execution of hedging contracts and gains from short-term energy price fluctuations.

        "page_content": "## /six.tf./one.tf Market risk policy\n\nOur most significant market risks relate to:\n\n- - energy and commodity prices\n- - foreign exchange rates\n- - interest rates and inflation.\n\nThe overall objective of our risk management is to:\n\n- -  increase the predictability of the short-term earnings and cash flow by securing the price of energy and currency\n- -  protect the long-term real value of 'shareholders' investment in \u00d8rsted by matching fixed nominal cash flows from our assets with fixed nominal debt.\n\n## Review of hedging frameworks\n\nIn response to the European energy crunch and to adapt to the ever-changing energy markets, we are capturing learnings and investigating potential lasting changes to our energy hedging policy.\n\n## Managing short-term market risks\n\nOur focus is on actively managing the market risks for the first five years. We primarily hedge future prices using derivatives to reduce cash flow fluctuations after tax.\n\nMinimum hedging levels are currently determined by the Board of Directors. In the first two years, price risks are almost fully hedged. The degree of  hedging declines in subsequent years due to:\n\n- -  reduced certainty about long-term production  volumes\n- -  increasing hedging costs in the medium to long term, both spread costs and costs of collateral\n- -  adverse impacts from collateral, potentially tying up large amounts of capital if hedging contracts become unfavourable.\n\n## Managing long-term market risks\n\nBeyond the next five years, our market risk picture is determined by our strategic asset portfolio. Our power exposure is partly mitigated through long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs), and we use debt to manage our long-term currency, interest rate, and inflation risks.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to our commodity, currency, interest, and inflation hedges. Where possible, we use hedging instruments which hedge the desired risk one-to-one. The GBP exposure, for example, is hedged using GBP forward exchange contracts, GBP swaps, or GBP loans. Thus, there are no significant sources of ineffectiveness. For currency swaps, the basis spread is accounted for according to the cost of the hedging model.\n\nTo the extent that a risk needs to be hedged, and if there is no fully effective instrument available in the market, analyses are performed of the expected effectiveness of the hedging instrument before the hedging transaction is concluded. In this case, the ratio between the hedged risk and the hedging instrument may deviate from the one-to-one  principle and will be determined as the ratio which most effectively hedges the desired risk.\n\nWe recognise changes to the market value of hedging instruments that qualify for recognition as a hedge of future cash flows in other comprehensive income in the hedging reserve. On realisation of the hedged cash flow, the resulting gains or losses are transferred from equity and recognised in the same item as the hedged item. However, on hedging of proceeds from future loans, the resulting gain or loss is transferred from equity over the term of the loan.\n\nWhen we conclude a hedging transaction, and each time we present financial statements thereafter, we assess whether the hedged exposure and the hedging instrument are still financially correlated. If the hedged cash flows are no longer expected to be realised, the accumulated value change is transferred to profit (loss) for the year.\n\nChanges in the market value of derivatives that are classified as hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability are recognised in profit (loss) for the year together with changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability to the extent of the hedged risk.",

Hence, the GBP exchange rate risk associated with power generation in the UK is hedged when the power price has been hedged.\n\nIn contrast, cash flows that relate to subsidised GBP income from offshore wind farms in the UK, less operating expenses, are hedged on a declining level of hedging over the fiveyear risk management horizon. The target is to hedge 100 % in year 1, declining by 20 percentage points each year to 20 % in year 5.\n\n## GBP exposure\n\nOur GBP exposure amounted to DKK 21.9 billion after hedging for the years 2022-2026. This unhedged GBP exposure stems primarily from subsidised GBP income less operational expenditures.\n\nThe GBP exchange rate for hedges impacting EBITDA in 2022 and 2023 is hedged at an average of GBP/DKK 8.5 and 8.3, respectively.\n\n## USD and NTD exposures\n\nFor our USD and NTD exposures from new markets, we have a limited existing portfolio against which we can net construction payments. Therefore, we seek to hedge the exchange rate risk in the near term by swapping out the exposure in time.\n\n## EUR exposure\n\nWe have a substantial exposure towards EUR, which we assess on a continuous basis. EUR is generally not hedged, as we believe that Denmark will maintain its fixed exchange-rate policy.\n\n## GBP exposures, DKKbn\n\n- Before hedging\n- After hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Development in currency rates, DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGBP\n\nUSD\n\nNTD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows our GBP exposure before and after hedges from:\n\n- -divestments  and investments\n- -green  certificates\n- -hedged  energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows the historic development in spot currency rates for the past three years and the forward rates for 2022 and 2023 as of 31 December 2021.",

The fixed-volume hedges do not fully match the actual hourly production profile our wind farms deliver. This is referred to as intermittency risk. See 'Intermittency risk' graph to the right. To manage the intermittency risk, we adjust our fixed-volume hedges when approaching delivery to better match the expected production profile.\n\n## Offshore power generation\n\nEarnings from power generation from offshore wind farms mainly comprise:\n\n- -  fixed tariffs in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK (CFD wind farms), the US, and Taiwan\n- -  guaranteed minimum prices for green certificates in the UK (ROC wind farms)\n- - long-term power purchase agreements\n- -  sale of power at market price from our wind farms with market price risks.\n\nAt the end of 2021, fixed tariffs and guaranteed minimum prices covered approx. 83 % of the expected income from offshore wind farms for the period 2022-2026. The remaining expected income is exposed to energy price risks and concerns sales of power at market price in the UK, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands. Part of this price risk has been reduced by entering into long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs).\n\n## Onshore power generation\n\nA large part of the earnings in Onshore comes from power generation in the US, which comprises tax incentives, such as PTCs or ITCs, and power. The tax incentives have a fixed value. However, there is a price risk associated with the power which is reduced by entering into CPPAs. The current CPPAs cover approx. 75 % of the expected generation for the period 2022-2026 from the commissioning of the wind farm. The CPPAs are entered into with large corporates or financial institutions.\n\n## Development in power prices, DKK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Intermittency risk\n\n- Actual production profile Flat profile in fixed-volume hedges Intermittency risk Fixed-volume hedges\n\n## Volume\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTime\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph shows the historic development in monthly average spot power prices for the past three years and the forward rates for 2022 and 2023 as of 31 December 2021.

        "page_content": "## Power generation at our CHPs\n\nOur combined heat and power (CHP) plants consist of biomass- and fossil-fuelled plants in Denmark. Heat generation accounts for a large share of the earnings and does not give rise to price risks, as the associated costs are covered by the heat customers. However, heat generation entails a price risk for power to the extent to which we generate heat and power simultaneously. The profitability of power generation is determined by the difference between the selling price of power and the purchase price of fuel and, for other fuels than biomass, carbon emission allowances. If the spreads are attractive, we provide condensing\n\n## \u00d8rsted's power price exposure before hedges for /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/six.tf split on markets, DKKbn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table shows our total exposure towards power prices before hedges for the period 2022-2026.\n\npower generation in addition to the CHP generation. The total net risk associated with power from heat-bound CHP generation for the 2022-2026 period is DKK 0.3 billion after hedging.\n\n## Commodity risk for construction projects\n\nWhen building a wind farm, we are exposed to the price development in a number of commodities, most significantly steel. Steel element indices have enabled hedging of parts of this risk. We have already hedged a substantial amount of the steel for foundations that will be delivered in 2022 and will continue to hedge more in the coming years.\n\n## Offshore's power price exposure, DKKbn\n\n- Before hedging After hedging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gas sales\n\nThe price risk associated with sale of gas stems from differences in the indexing of sales and purchase prices. Our largest gas purchase contracts are mainly indexed to pure gas prices and thus no longer constitute a significant risk.\n\n## Power sales\n\nThe price risk associated with power sales is given by the difference between the purchase and sales prices and is thus considered to be limited.\n\n## Principles for estimating exposures\n\nExposure is calculated as the expected production (or net purchase/sale) times the forward price for the respective years.\n\nThe table shows the exposure from Offshore's generation of power before and after hedges.",

This is the case for earnings related to our UK wind farms.\n\nHowever, we are exposed to inflation risk on projects with fixed nominal cash flows, as an increase in inflation will erode the expected real value of the revenue. This is the case for:\n\n- -  fixed nominal subsidies from offshore wind assets in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the US\n\n- -  fixed nominal power purchase agreements related to onshore wind assets in the US and offshore wind assets in Europe and Taiwan\n- -  fixed (hedged) nominal revenue from offshore wind assets in the UK.\n\nA total of ~65 % of our expected revenue from assets in operation, under construction, or awarded for the period 2022-2031 will increase and decrease as inflation changes. The main reason for this is that ~50 % of our revenue is based on contracts indexed to inflation, and ~15% is based on merchant power prices.\n\nThe remaining ~35 % of the revenue is fixed and is therefore subject to real value loss if inflation increases. We actively manage the duration of debt and hybrid bonds to balance  inflation risk by issuing fixed-rate debt and  entering into derivatives. With active management, we have reduced our net inflation risk from ~35 % to ~20 %.\n\nTo create a better match with our fixed-rate UK debt, we have fixed the inflation for part of the future revenue from our UK offshore wind farms at an average retail price index (RPI) rate of 3.6 % for the priod 2024-2037 and an average consumer price index (CPI) rate of 2.7 % for the period 2030-2033.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInflation-indexed revenue contracts reduce the impact on \u00d8rsted's equity value from changes in interest rates by ~50 % as interest rates and inflation rates over time tend to correlate well.",

A large part of our counterparty risks concerns major  international energy companies and banks. Such trading is regulated under standard agreements, such as EFET and ISDA agreements, which feature, for instance, credit rating and netting provisions. Our credit exposure is mainly concentrated on counterparties in Denmark, the UK, Germany, and the US.\n\nWe limit our credit risks by:\n\n- - rating significant counterparties\n- -  granting credit limits\n- -  demanding that collateral be furnished, or/uni00A0credit insurance put in place for weak counterparties.\n\nThe counterparties and credit limits  granted are monitored on an ongoing basis. The monitoring is based on the framework established by our Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. For the most significant counterparties, an internal rating is required to determine credit limits. The rating is based on information from  external credit rating agencies, publicly  available information, and our own analyses.\n\nWe have not suffered losses from any single major counterparty in 2021 or 2020.\n\nThe credit risks from our financial assets primarily concern derivatives, cash, securities, and receivables. The assessment is based on the\n\nindividual counterparty's ratings with Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. The  figures do not reflect our actual credit  exposure, as the positions are calculated  before offsetting our debt to such counterparties.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n| Credit quality of the Group's counterparties,  DKKm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf               | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| AAA/Aaa                                               | /one.tf/eight.tf,/two.tf/one.tf/five.tf     | /two.tf/one.tf,/four.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf   |\n| AA/Aa                                                 | /three.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/five.tf        | /one.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/two.tf            |\n| A/A                                                   | /one.tf/two.tf,/three.tf/two.tf/three.tf    | /nine.tf,/one.tf/four.tf/nine.tf           |\n| BBB/Baa                                               | /one.tf/four.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/one.tf     | /three.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/seven.tf        |\n| Non-rated                                             | /nine.tf,/zero.tf/five.tf/six.tf            | /nine.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/two.tf            |\n| Total credit exposure                                 | /five.tf/seven.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/zero.tf | /four.tf/five.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf |\n\nWe only offset positive and negative values if we are entitled to and intend to settle several financial instruments net.\n\n| Offsetting of financial assets,  DKKm    | Derivatives                                    | Trade receivables                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                   | Derivatives                         | Trade receivables                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf             |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets                         | /seven.tf/nine.tf,/seven.tf/eight.tf/one.tf    | /four.tf/three.tf,/two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf    | /one.tf/two.tf/two.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/four.tf | /nine.tf,/three.tf/zero.tf/two.tf   | /one.tf/three.tf,/six.tf/five.tf/five.tf  | /two.tf/two.tf,/nine.tf/five.tf/seven.tf   |\n| Financial liabilities, offset            | (/five.tf/seven.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/three.tf) | (/three.tf/eight.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf) | (/nine.tf/five.tf,/five.tf/four.tf/two.tf)      | (/four.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/seven.tf) | (/one.tf/one.tf,/eight.tf/four.tf/two.tf) | (/one.tf/six.tf,/three.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf) |\n| Financial assets in the balance sheet    | /two.tf/two.tf,/two.tf/four.tf/eight.tf        | /five.tf,/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf              | /two.tf/seven.tf,/four.tf/four.tf/two.tf        | /four.tf,/eight.tf/three.tf/five.tf | /one.tf,/eight.tf/one.tf/three.tf         | /six.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/eight.tf           |\n| Amounts not offset in the balance sheet: |                                                |                                               |                                                 |                                     |                                           |                                            |\n| Liabilities with offsetting rights       | (/six.tf,/eight.tf/one.tf/two.tf)              | -

        "page_content": "## /six.tf./six.tf   Fair value measurement\n\nWe measure our securities and derivatives at fair value. A number of our derivatives, mainly power purchase agreements, are measured based on unobservable inputs due to the long duration of the contracts. The most significant non-observable input is the long-term US power price (mainly ERCOT).\n\n## Valuation principles and key assumptions\n\nIn 2021, we have further developed our valuation methods, and we have now included intermittency as a separate assumption. See section 'Estimating non-observable power prices' for more details.\n\nIn order to minimise the use of subjective estimates or modifications of parameters and calculation models, it is our policy to determine fair values based on the external information that most accurately reflects\n\nThe deferred gains/losses are recognised as revenue in profit or loss in the future period to which the market value relates. In 2021, we have recognised an  income of DKK 139 million (2020: DKK 184 million) related to the deferred fair value of CPPAs not recognised in profit or loss at initial recognition. The total amount of deferred gains as of 31  December 2021 amounts to DKK 834 million (2020: DKK 736 million).\n\n## Significant non-observable inputs\n\nMarket values based on non-observable input comprise primarily long-term contracts on the purchase or sale of power and gas. Since there are no active markets for the long-term prices of power and gas, the market values have been determined through an estimate of the future prices.\n\nthe market values. We use pricing services and benchmark services to increase the data quality. Market values are determined by the Risk Management function, which reports to the CFO. The development in market values is monitored on a continuing basis and reported to the Executive Committee.\n\n## Deferred day one gain/losses from power purchase agreements\n\nThe deferred day one gains from CPPAs consist of the market value of CPPAs purchased as part of a business combination or asset acquisition. The CPPAs lock the  power price of the expected power generation over a period of 10-20 years. These contracts are accounted for at fair value. Due to the long duration of these CPPAs, power prices are not observable for a large part of the duration.\n\n|                                      | Assets                              | Assets                                   | Assets                                    | Liabilities                                 |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Fair value hierarchy,  DKKm          | Inventories                         | Derivatives                              | Securities                                | Derivatives                                 |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf        |                                     |                                          |                                           |                                             |\n| Quoted prices                        | /two.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /five.tf,/five.tf/seven.tf/four.tf       | -                                         | /eight.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf         |\n| Observable input                     | -                                   | /nine.tf,/nine.tf/nine.tf/one.tf         | /two.tf/one.tf,/two.tf/two.tf/eight.tf    | /three.tf/two.tf,/three.tf/one.tf/three.tf  |\n| Non-observable input                 | -                                   | /one.tf,/two.tf/two.tf/nine.tf           | -                                         | /eight.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf         |\n| Total /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  | /two.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/six.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/four.tf | /two.tf/one.tf,/two.tf/two.tf/eight.tf    | /four.tf/nine.tf,/seven.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf       |                                     |                                          |                                           |                                             |\n| Quoted prices                        | /one.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf | /two.tf,/zero.tf/seven.tf/four.tf        | -                                         | /two.tf,/two.tf/nine.tf/four.tf             |\n| Observable input                     | -                                   | /three.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/seven.tf        | /two.tf/five.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/four.tf         |\n| Non-observable input                 | -                                   | /four.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                | -                                         | /four.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf                    |\n| Total /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf | /six.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf          | /two.tf/five.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /six.tf,/three.tf/one.tf/eight.tf           |\n\n## Estimating non-observable power prices\n\nSince our CPPAs are normally settled on the actual production, and the power prices available in the market are based on a constant production (flat profile), we take into account that our expected production is not constant, and thus our CPPAs will not be settled against a flat profile price (intermittency adjustment).

The ESG performance report also includes additional information, such as selected ESG indicators by country and all ESG accounting policies, including a list of  references for conversion factors used in calculations.\n\n## Scope and consolidation\n\nUnless otherwise stated, ESG data is reported on the basis of the same principles as the financial statements. Thus, the  consolidated ESG statements include consolidated data from the parent company \u00d8rsted A/S and subsidiaries controlled by \u00d8rsted A/S. Joint operations are also included with \u00d8rsted's proportionate share. Data from associates and joint ventures are not included.\n\nThe consolidation of safety data deviates from the above-described principles. Safety data is collected using an operational scope. This means that irrespective of our ownership share, we include 100 % of injuries and hours worked, etc., arising from all operations where \u00d8rsted is responsible for safety, including\n\nsafety related to external suppliers. Data from acquisitions and divestments are  included or excluded from the date of acquisition or divestment.\n\n## Danish Financial Statements Act, sections 99 a, 99 b, and 107 d\n\nPursuant to section 99 a of the Danish Financial Statements Act (\u00c5rsregnskabsloven), \u00d8rsted is under an obligation to account for the company's CSR activities and report on business strategies and activities with regard to human rights, labour rights, anti-corruption, the environment, and the climate.

This proportion predominantly included revenue from our wind and solar farms (56 %) and from our sustainable biomass-based activities at our Danish combined heat and power (CHP) plants (10 %).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe installed renewable capacity increased by 15 % in 2021 due to the acquisitions of Brookfield Renewable (onshore wind, 327 MW) and Lincoln Land (onshore wind, 302 MW) and the commissioning of Western Trail (onshore wind, 367 MW), Permian  Energy Center (solar PV, 420 MW AC , and battery storage, 40 MW AC ), and Muscle Shoals (solar PV, 227 MW AC ).\n\nThe total energy generation increased by 15 % in 2021, driven by increased onshore and solar generation capacities and increased demands for thermal generation, partly offset by lower wind speeds.\n\nOffshore power generation decreased by 9 % to 13.8 TWh in 2021 relative to 2020. The decrease was mainly due to significantly lower wind speeds and the divestment of 50 % of Borssele 1 & 2 in May 2021, partly offset by ramp-up of generation from Borssele 1 & 2.\n\nOnshore generation increased by 9 % in 2021 relative to 2020. The increase was due to additional generation from our new onshore wind and solar farms, partly offset by lower onshore wind speeds.\n\nBioenergy & Other heat and power generation increased by 33 % in 2021 compared with 2020 due to increased heat demand in 2021 as a result of colder weather, and increased power generation from CHP generation driven by the heat demand and condensing power generation driven by the high power prices compared to 2020.",

Availability was at the same level in 2021 as in 2020. This led to a 3 %-points lower load factor in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nGas sales decreased by 29.0 TWh to 61.3 TWh in 2021 compared to 2020. Power sales (Offshore) decreased by 4.1 TWh to 25.0 TWh in 2021 compared to 2020, and power sales (Bioenergy & Other) decreased by 2.8 TWh to 8.8 TWh in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe green share of our energy generation continued to be 90 % in 2021, in line with 2020. This was primarily due to increased renewable generation from onshore wind, solar PV, and sustainable biomass, offset by reduced offshore wind power generation. Our target is 99 % green energy generation by 2025.\n\nOur greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity (scope 1 and 2) also continued to be at the same level as in 2020 due to an approx. 15 % increase in both scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and energy generation. We are well on track to meeting our target of a GHG emission intensity of no more than 10 g CO 2 e/kWh in 2025.\n\nOur scope 3 GHG emissions were reduced by 28 % from 2020 to 2021. The main driver for this was the 32 % decrease in gas sales, primarily due to the divestment of the LNG business in December 2020, which resulted in a 35 % decrease in category 11 GHG emissions. This decrease was partly offset by a 147 % increase in our category 2 GHG emissions from the supply chain and installation of our new onshore wind and solar farms.",

With a satisfaction and motivation score of 77 in 2021, we were above our external survey provider's benchmark, but just below our target of being in the top 10 % compared to our benchmark peer group.\n\nOur total recordable injury rate (TRIR) decreased from 3.6 in 2020 to 3.0 in 2021. The decline was driven by both an overall improvement in our workplace safety and by the full-year effect of the divestment of our Danish power distribution, residential customer, and city light businesses in 2020. As we almost achieved our previous TRIR target of 2.9 in 2025, we have raised our ambition to a target of 2.5 by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur employees and other associates may report serious offences, such as cases of bribery, fraud, and other inappropriate or illegal conduct, to our whistleblower scheme or through our management system. In 2021, five substantiated cases of inappropriate or unlawful behaviour were reported through our whistle-blower scheme. Four cases related to the workplace environment, and one case concerned IT security. None of the reported cases were critical to our business, nor caused adjustments to our financial results. None of the cases required a police report.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible KPIs\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible revenue\n\nThe share of \u00d8rsted's taxonomy-eligible revenue is calculated as the revenue derived from products or services associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities as a proportion of \u00d8rsted's total net revenue (see p. 90).\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible OPEX\n\nThe share of \u00d8rsted's taxonomy-eligible OPEX is calculated as the OPEX related to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities as a proportion of \u00d8rsted's OPEX that is included in 'Other external expenses' (see p. 73).\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible EBITDA\n\nThe share of \u00d8rsted's taxonomy-eligible EBITDA is calculated as the EBITDA derived from products or services associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities as a proportion of \u00d8rsted's total net EBITDA (see p. 73).\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible CAPEX\n\nThe share of \u00d8rsted's taxonomy-eligible CAPEX is calculated as the CAPEX related to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities as a proportion of \u00d8rsted's CAPEX that is accounted for based on IAS 16 (73: (e) (i) and (iii)), IAS 38 (118: (e) (i)), and IFRS 16 (53: (h)) and thereby included in 'Additions' (see p. 101).\n\n## Business drivers\n\n## Installed renewable capacity\n\nThe installed renewable capacity is calculated as renewable gross capacity installed by \u00d8rsted accumulated over time. We include all capacities after commercial operation date (COD) has been reached, and where we had an ownership share and an EPC role (engineering, procurement, and construction) in the project. Capacities from acquisitions are added to the installed capacity. For installed renewable thermal capacity, we use the heat capacity as heat is the primary outcome of thermal energy\n\ngeneration, and as bioconversions of the combined heat and power (CHP) plants are driven by heat contracts.\n\n## Decided (FID'ed) renewable capacity\n\nDecided (FID'ed) capacity is renewable capacity for which a final investment decision (FID) has been made.\n\n## Awarded and contracted renewable capacity\n\nThe awarded renewable capacity is based on the capacities which have been awarded to \u00d8rsted in auctions and tenders. The contracted capacity is the capacity for which \u00d8rsted has signed a contract or power purchase agreement (PPA) concerning a new renewable energy plant. We include the full capacity if more than 50 % of PPAs or offtake are secured.\n\n## Heat and power generation\n\nPower generation from wind and solar farms is calculated as generation sold. The offshore wind farms Gunfleet Sands 1 & 2 and Walney 1 & 2 have been consolidated according to ownership interest. Other wind farms, solar farms, and CHP plants are financially consolidated.\n\nThermal power generation is determined as net generation sold, based on settlements from the official Danish production database. Data for generation from foreign facilities are provided by the operators.\n\nHeat (including steam) generation is  measured as net output sold to heat customers.\n\n## Power generation capacity\n\nPower generation capacity from an offshore wind farm is calculated and included from the time when the individual wind turbine has passed a 240-hour test.\n\nThe offshore wind farms Gunfleet Sands 1 & 2 and Walney 1 & 2 have been consolidated according to ownership interest. Other wind farms have been financially consolidated.\n\n## Wind speed\n\nWind speeds for the areas where \u00d8rsted's offshore and onshore wind farms are located are provided to \u00d8rsted by an external supplier, except for our new Irish onshore assets where wind speeds are measured on site. Wind speeds are weighted on the basis of the capacity of the individual wind farms and consolidated to an \u00d8rsted total for offshore and onshore, respectively. 'Normal wind speed' is a historical wind speed average (over a minimum 20-year period).\n\n## Availability\n\nAvailability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by market-requested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments as these are due to external factors. Total availability is determined by weighting the individual wind farm's availability against its capacity.\n\n## Load factor\n\nThe load factor is calculated as the ratio between actual generation over a period relative to potential generation, which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period. The load factor is commercially adjusted. This means that the offshore wind farm has been financially compensated by the transmission system operators when it is available for generation, but the output cannot be supplied to the grid due to maintenance or grid interruptions. New offshore wind turbines are included in the calculations of availability and load factor once they have passed a 240-hour test. Onshore wind turbines are included once they have passed commercial operation date (COD).\n\n## Degree days\n\nThe number of degree days expresses the difference between an average indoor temperature of 17 \u00b0C and the outside mean temperature for a given period.\n\nIt helps compare the heat demand for a given year with a normal year.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales of power and gas are calculated as physical sales to retail customers, wholesale customers, and exchanges. Sales are based on readings from \u00d8rsted's trading systems. Internal sales to Bioenergy are not included in the statement.\n\n## Environment\n\n## Green share of energy generation\n\nThe green (renewable energy) share of our heat and power generation and the distribution of the generation volume on the individual energy sources and fuels are calculated on the basis of the energy sources used and the energy generated at the different energy plants.\n\nFor combined heat and power (CHP) plants, the share of the specific fuel (e.g. sustainable biomass) is calculated relative to the total fuel consumption for a given plant or unit within a given time period. The specific fuel share is then multiplied by the total heat and power generation for the specific plant or unit in the specific period. The result is the fuel-based generation for the individual unit, for example the sustainable biomass-based generation of heat and power from the CHP plant unit within a given time period.\n\nThe percentage shares of the individual energy sources are calculated by dividing the generation from the individual energy source by the total generation.\n\nThe following energy sources and fuels are considered to be renewable energy: wind, solar PV, sustainable biomass, biogas, and power sourced with renewable energy certificates. The following energy sources are considered to be fossil energy sources: coal, natural gas, and oil.",

        "page_content": "## Green share of energy generation, Bioenergy & Other\n\nThis is calculated as the green share of heat and power generation, but is only shown for the business unit Bioenergy & Other.\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity\n\nGHG intensity (scope 1 and 2) is calculated as total scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based) emissions divided by total heat and power generation, revenue, and EBITDA, respectively.\n\nGHG intensity (scope 1, 2, and 3) is calculated as total scope 1, scope 2 (market-based), and scope 3 emissions (excluding natural gas sales) divided by total heat and power generation.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are calculated based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\nScope 1 GHG emissions cover all direct emissions of greenhouse gases from \u00d8rsted. The direct carbon emissions from the combined heat and power plants are determined on the basis of the fuel quantities used in accordance with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions outside the EU ETS scheme are, for the most part, calculated as energy consumptions multiplied by emission factors.\n\nScope 2 GHG emissions include the indirect GHG emissions from the generation of power, heat, and steam purchased and consumed by \u00d8rsted. Scope 2 emissions are primarily calculated as the power volumes  purchased multiplied by countryspecific emission factors. Location-based emissions are calculated based on average emission factors for each country, whereas market-based emissions take the green power purchased into account and assume the regular power is delivered as residual power where the green part has been taken out.\n\n## Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nScope 3 GHG emissions are reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which divides the scope 3 inventory into 15 subcategories.\n\nGHG emissions from capital goods include  upstream GHG emissions from acquired and installed wind and solar farms in the month when the wind or solar farm has reached commercial operation date (COD). Carbon emissions are included from cradle to operations.\n\nGHG emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities are calculated based on actual fuel consumption and power sales, multiplied by relevant emission factors. We include all power sales to end  customers and use separate emission factors for green (with certificates) and regular (without certificates) power sales.\n\nGHG emissions from use of sold products are calculated based on actual sales of gas to both end users and wholesale as reported in our ESG consolidation system. The total gas sale is divided into natural gas, LNG, and biogas which have specific upstream and downstream emission factors.\n\n## 'Other' includes GHG emissions from:\n\n- -   category 1:  Purchased goods and services\n- -  category /four.tf:   Upstream transportation and distribution\n- -   category /five.tf:   Waste generated in operations\n- -category  /six.tf: Business  travel\n- -category  /seven.tf: Employee  commuting\n- -category  /nine.tf: Downstream  transportation and distribution.\n\n## Social\n\n## Employees\n\nEmployee data is recognised based on records from the Group's ordinary registration systems. The number of employees is determined as the number\n\nof employees at the end of each month converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs). Employees who have been made redundant are recognised until the expiry of their notice period, regardless of whether they have been released from all or some of their duties during their notice period.\n\n'Gender with the lowest representation (female)' represents the gender  distribution of the total workforce in \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Employee satisfaction\n\n\u00d8rsted conducts a comprehensive employee satisfaction survey once a year. With a few exceptions, all \u00d8rsted employees are invited to participate in the survey. The following employees are omitted from the survey results: employees who joined the company shortly before the employee satisfaction survey, employees who resigned shortly after the employee satisfaction survey, interns, consultants, advisers, and external temporary workers who do not have an employment contract with \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Safety\n\nOccupational injuries are calculated according to operational scope. Data from companies whollyor partly-owned by \u00d8rsted, and where \u00d8rsted is responsible for safety, is included. Occupational injuries and lost-time injuries are calculated for both our own employees and our contractors. Data from all \u00d8rsted locations is recognised.\n\nThe total recordable injury rate (TRIR) is calculated as the number of total recordable injuries per one million hours worked. The number of hours worked is based on 1,667 working hours annually per full-time employee and monthly records of the number of employees converted into full-time employees. For suppliers, the actual number of hours worked is recognised on the basis of data provided by the supplier, access control systems at locations, or estimates.\n\nFatalities are the number of employees who lost their lives as a result of a work-related incident.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board of Directors of \u00d8rsted A/S\n\nThe employee representatives on the Board of Directors are not included in the data for the Board of Directors.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe Executive Committee consists of the Executive Board (our CEO, our CFO, and our Deputy Group CEO and CCO) and three additional members who undertake the day-to-day management of \u00d8rsted.\n\n## Substantiated whistle-blower cases\n\n\u00d8rsted's whistle-blower hotline is available for internal and external reporting of suspected cases of inappropriate or illegal behaviour. Whistle-blower cases are received and handled by the Internal Audit function which also receives similar reports through the management system and from compliance officers. All reports are managed in accordance with the guidelines for the handling of whistle-blower reports approved by the Audit & Risk Committee, which is ultimately responsible for the whistleblower scheme. Only cases which are closed during the financial year, and which have been reported to the Audit & Risk Committee as fully or partially substantiated, are reported.\n\n## Cases transferred to the police\n\nCases transferred to the police are defined as the number of cases reported in accordance with the above which have been transferred to the police.",

Basis of reporting\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act ('\u00c5rsregnskabsloven') (reporting class D).\n\nThe Danish Financial Statements Act allows us to use certain IFRS standards to interpret the act. Therefore, we have previously implemented IFRS 15 'Revenue' and IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\nThe accounting policies remain unchanged from the previous year.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK) rounded to the nearest million.\n\nThe parent company accounting policies are consistent with the accounting policies described for the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nWe recognise exchange rate adjustments of receivables from and payables to subsidiaries as financial income and expenses in the income statement when the balances are accounted for as part of the total net investment in foreign enterprises. Likewise, we recognise foreign exchange gains and losses on loans and derivatives in the income statement as financial income and expenses\n\nwhen they have been entered into to hedge the net investment in the foreign enterprises.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRental income comprises income from commercial leases and is recognised over the term of the lease. Income from services is recognised when delivery has taken place.\n\n## Dividends from investments\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and associates are recognised in the income statement for the financial year in which the dividends are approved at the annual general meeting. If the dividends exceed the total income after takeover, the dividends are recognised as a reduction of the cost of the investment under assets.\n\n## Investments\n\nWe measure our investments in  subsidiaries and associates at cost. If there is any indication that the value of a company is lower than our future earnings in the company, impairment testing of the company is carried out as described in the consolidated financial statements. The carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount whenever the carrying amount exceeds the future earnings in the company (recoverable amount).\n\nIf we have a legal or constructive obligation to cover a deficit in subsidiaries and  associates, we recognise a provision for this.\n\n## Tax\n\n\u00d8rsted A/S is taxed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. The jointly taxed companies are part of joint taxation with the parent company as the management company.\n\nSubsidiaries are included in the joint taxation from the date they are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements and up to the date on which they are no longer consolidated.\n\nCurrent tax for 2021 is recognised by the individual, jointly taxed companies.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nWe do not prepare a separate statement of cash flows for the parent company. Reference is made to the consolidated statement of cash flows on page 77.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe West Coast Hub, Barrow-in-Furness, The UK.\n\n## Key accounting estimates\n\nIn connection with the preparation of the financial statements, a number of accounting estimates have been made that affect the profit (loss) and balance sheet. Estimates are regularly reassessed by management on the basis of historical experience and other relevant factors.\n\n## Impairment test\n\nIf there is any indication that the carrying amount is lower than our future earnings in a company, we test for impairment as described in the consolidated financial statements. The future earnings of the company (recoverable amount) are calculated based on assumptions concerning significant estimates.",

Collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional ethical requirements applicable in Denmark.

Significant judgements and estimates are required in determining the income taxes and the measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, including uncertain tax positions.\n\nManagement makes significant judgments and estimates when calculating and assessing the income taxes due to the complex nature of the tax rules related to the business activities conducted in different tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, management makes estimates, when measuring the tax assets, including when and to which extent these can be utilised in the future, and when measuring tax liabilities, including assessing deferred taxes in tax equity partnerships.\n\nAdditionally, \u00d8rsted is a party in tax and transfer pricing disputes, where management assesses the possible outcomes and consequently recognise provisions to cover for these uncertain tax positions. In 2020 and 2021, \u00d8rsted received administrative decisions from the Danish Tax Agency entailing additional tax payables and related interests, which management disputes and has appealed to the relevant authorities.\n\nOn this basis, income taxes were a matter of most significance in our audit.\n\nRefer to notes 1.2, 4.2, and 4.3 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor income taxes, income tax assets, and liabilities, we evaluated the assumptions applied by management in determining the recognition and measurement of income taxes and deferred taxes, including those related to tax equity partnerships, while taking into account relevant correspondence with tax authorities and external advisors.\n\nWe assessed management's judgements and estimates of tax balances and carrying amounts as well as the related applied tax rates when calculating these. We also assessed the reasonableness of the main data and assumptions used to calculate the taxable income forecasts underlying the recognition and recoverability of the deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforward.\n\nWe evaluated and tested \u00d8rsted's processes for recording, assessing, and continual reassessing provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nIn our audit of uncertain tax positions, we obtained and reviewed the correspondence with relevant tax authorities in order to consider the completeness of the tax disputes and the related provisions. We assessed the measurement of the provisions and challenged the assumptions used, including the possibility of obtaining corresponding tax adjustments, compensations from partners, and the likelihood of different outcomes. In addition, we assessed relevant opinions obtained by management from third parties related to the tax disputes, and we evaluated the disclosures provided by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our audit of income taxes, we involved our tax specialists.",

We did not identify any material misstatement in management's review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for the preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true and fair\n\nview in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement\n\nand maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control\n- -  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the parent company's internal control\n- -  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management\n- -  conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in\n\nthe financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern\n\n- -  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view\n- -  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter, or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the financial statements, we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2021 with the file name W9NG6WMZIYEU8VEDOG48-2021-12-31-en is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:\n\n- -  preparing the annual report in XHTML format\n- -  selecting and applying appropriate iXBRL-tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgement, where necessary\n- -  ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the consolidated financial statements presented in human-readable format; and\n- -  carrying out such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable\n\nassurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing, and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- -  testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format\n- -  obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process\n- -  evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements\n- -  evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified\n- -  evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- -  reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2021 with the file name W9NG6WMZIYEU8VEDOG48-2021-12-31-en is prepared, in all material respects, in com pliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nHellerup, 2 February 2022\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR No 3377 1231\n\n## Rasmus Friis J\u00f8rgensen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne28705\n\n## Anders Stig Lauritsen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne32800",

        "page_content": "## Independent limited assurance report on the consolidated ESG statements\n\n## To the stakeholders of \u00d8rsted A/S\n\n\u00d8rsted A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the data described below and set out in the consolidated environment, social, and governance (ESG) statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2021 ('consolidated ESG statements') as included on pages 151-157 in the annual report of \u00d8rsted A/S for 2021.\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we performed, and the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that the consolidated ESG statements are free of material misstatements and are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies as stated on pages 152-157.\n\nThis conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report.\n\n## What we are assuring\n\nThe scope of our work was limited to assurance over data in the consolidated ESG statements in the 2021 annual report.\n\n## Professional standards applied and level of assurance\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information' and, in respect of the reported greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 'Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements'. The quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to\n\ndetermine the emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gasses.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n## Our independence and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the independence requirements and other ethical requirements in the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, and ethical requirements applicable in Denmark.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.\n\n## Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies\n\nThe consolidated ESG statements need to be read and understood together with the\n\naccounting policies, which Management is solely responsible for selecting and applying. The  absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure ESG information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\n## Work performed\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated ESG statements. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we:\n\n- -   made inquiries and conducted interviews with Group functions to assess consolidation processes, use of company-wide systems, and controls performed at Group level\n- -   checked ESG data on a sample basis to underlying documentation and evaluated the appropriateness of quantification methods and compliance with the accounting policies for preparing the consolidated ESG statements\n- -   conducted an analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted by all business units for consolidation at Group level\n- -   considered the disclosure and presentation of the consolidated ESG statements; and\n- -   evaluated the obtained evidence.\n\n## Management's responsibilities\n\nManagement of \u00d8rsted A/S is responsible for:\n\n- -   designing, implementing, and maintaining internal controls over information relevant to the preparation of data in the consolidated ESG statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error\n- -   establishing objective accounting policies for preparing the consolidated ESG statements\n- -   measuring and reporting data in the consolidated ESG statements based on the accounting policies and evidencing the data; and\n- -   preparing the content of the consolidated ESG statements for 2021.\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are responsible for:\n\n- -   planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the consolidated ESG statements for the period 1 January - 31 December 2021 are free from material misstatements and are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies\n- -   forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained; and\n- -   reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of \u00d8rsted A/S.\n\nHellerup, 2 February 2022\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR no. 3377 1231\n\n## Rasmus Friis J\u00f8rgensen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne28705\n\n## Anders Stig Lauritsen\n\nState Authorised Public Accountant mne32800",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nAvailability: Availability is calculated as the ratio of actual production to the possible production, which is the sum of lost production and actual production in a given period. The production-based availability (PBA) is impacted by grid and wind turbine outages, which are technical production losses. PBA is not impacted by market requested shutdowns and wind farm curtailments, as this is deemed not to be reflective of site performance, but due to external factors.\n\nAvoided emissions: The amount other sources of energy would have emitted, if we had not generated energy from renewable sources.\n\nAwarded capacity: Offshore capacity that we have been awarded in auctions and tenders, but where we have yet to sign a PPA and take final investment decision.\n\nBlockage effect: The blockage effect arises from the wind slowing down as it approaches the wind turbines.\n\nBSUoS tariffs: Costs related to the day-to-day operation of the transmission system imposed on generators and suppliers.\n\nCarbon emission allowances: Carbon emission allowances subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).\n\nCFD : A contract for difference is a subsidy that guarantees the difference between the market reference price and the exercise price won.\n\nCHP : A combined heat and power plant (CHP) generates both heat and power in the same procces.\n\nCommissioning/COD: When our assets are in operation, and the legal liability has been transferred from the supplier to us.\n\nContracted capacity: Onshore capacity where we have signed PPAs covering more than 50 % of the asset's capacity, but where we have not yet taken final investment decision.\n\nDecided (FID) and installed capacity: Installed generation capacity plus capacity for assets where a final investment decision has been made.\n\nDegree days: Number of degrees in absolute figures in difference between the average temperature and the official Danish indoor temperature of 17 \u00b0C.\n\nDirect current (DC): The type of power generated by our solar panels.\n\nEPC: Engineering, procurement, and construction. The part of our business which handles the construction and installation of assets.\n\nFID: Final investment decision. When the Board of Directors approves larger investments for construction assets\n\nGeneration capacity: \u00d8rsted's ownership of the asset. Offshore wind turbines are included when each turbine has passed the 240-hour test. Onshore capacities are included after COD of the entire asset.\n\nGreen certificates: Certificate awarded to producers of environment-friendly power as a supplement to the market price of power in the given price area.\n\nGreen dark spread (GDS): Represents the contribution margin per MWh of power generated at a coal-fired CHP plant with a given efficiency. It is determined as the difference between the market price of power and the cost of the coal (including associated freight costs) and carbon emission allowances used to generate the power.\n\nInstalled capacity: Installed capacity where the asset has been completed and has passed a final test.\n\nInvestment tax credits (ITCs): Federal tax credit based on qualifying renewable investment costs.\n\nLoad factor: The ratio between the actual power generation in a given period relative to the potential generation which is possible by continuously exploiting the maximum capacity over the same period.\n\nOffshore transmission assets: Connect offshore generation to the onshore grid and typically include the offshore power transmission infrastructure, an onshore substation, and the electrical equipment relating to the operation of the substation.\n\nO&M: Operations and maintenance. The part of our business that operates and maintains our assets after installation.\n\nPartnership income: Income originating from our partners' purchase of ownership interests in the offshore wind farms. Includes both the gain in connection with the farm-down and the subsequent construction of the wind farm.\n\nPower purchase agreement (PPA): An agreement between us and a buyer/seller to purchase/sell the power we generate which includes all commercial terms (price, delivery, volumes etc.)\n\nProduction tax credit (PTC): Federal tax credit based on eligible power generation in the US.\n\nROCs: Renewable obligation certificates issued by Ofgem in the UK to operators of accredited generating stations for the eligible renewable energy they generate. Operators can trade ROCs with other parties.\n\nTax equity: An arrangement where an investor obtains rights to federal tax credits and other tax attributes in exchange for a cash contribution.\n\nTEC: Transmission entry capacity defines a generator's maximum contractual level of transmission access in MW.\n\nTNUoS tariffs: Costs related to the use of the transmission networks in the UK based on TEC.\n\nTRIR: In addition to lost-time injuries, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) also includes injuries where the injured person is able to perform restricted work the day after the accident as well as accidents where the injured person has received medical treatment.\n\nWake effect: Wake within wind farms and between neighbouring wind farms. There is a wake after each wind turbine where the wind slows down. As the wind flow continues, the wake spreads, and the wind speed recovers.\n\nWind speed: Shows the wind speed at \u00d8rsted's wind farms. The wind measurements are weighted on the basis of our generation capacity and can be compared to a normal wind period.",
