We continued to broaden our technology platforms and product pipeline to strengthen the basis for longterm growth whilst investing significantly in expanding our future production capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur long-standing aspiration of creating value for society and for our future business is more relevant than ever, given the mounting threats to people's lives and livelihoods posed by the health and environmental challenges dominating today's global agenda. The past two years have underscored the essential role of science in tackling these challenges, whether managing a rogue virus or reducing emissions.\n\nContinued investment in innovation is vital for patients, the future of our company and for the wider benefits we can offer to society. It is therefore gratifying to see the strides that have been made in 2021 with the launch of new products - most notably Wegovy \u00ae for obesity. Production challenges meant that we struggled to meet the high patient demand for the treatment - a situation that served to underline the vital importance of investments made in our global production capacity during 2021.\n\nThe opportunity for the coming years is to execute on the commercial potential of our innovative, new treatments while ensuring that as many people as possible have access to quality medicines. At the same time, we must succeed in developing the medicines of the future. This means looking beyond our existing focus areas and our successful GLP-1 molecule semaglutide, towards other therapy areas and new technology platforms to address unmet medical needs related to serious chronic diseases.\n\nTo serve more patients with high quality medicines and to continue to grow sustainably, we will evolve and challenge ourselves in how we work and innovate. This also entails combining our company's deep in-house expertise with the best science from outside, through partnerships with other businesses, with universities around the world and with research institutions. If we succeed, Novo Nordisk will look very different a decade from now, by which time we will not only be\n\nserving people living with diabetes and obesity but also making a positive impact in new therapeutic areas.\n\nOur stable ownership structure with the Novo Nordisk Foundation as the main shareholder will help in this transition by supporting us through investment in research and development for the long-term while maintaining a focus on high quality operations and financial performance.\n\nWe must also ensure that Novo Nordisk has a diverse and truly inclusive culture if we are to become a better and more innovative company. With this in mind, we have set new 2025 aspirational targets for achieving a balanced gender representation across managerial levels. We believe that this will also stimulate and inspire the work we are doing to enhance other diversity dimensions.\n\nAt Board level, we are also committed to ensuring strong diversity and having the right competences to meet future challenges. In 2021, the Board was delighted to welcome the election of Henrik Poulsen, whose deep experience in corporate transformations and strong ESG credentials will be invaluable. I would also like to thank Brian Daniels and Liz Hewitt, who stepped down from the Board in 2021, for their significant contributions to Novo Nordisk.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all Novo Nordisk employees for their dedication and contribution to the good operational and strategic progress in 2021; to CEO Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen and his team for their leadership and to our shareholders and other stakeholders for continued support.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChair of the Board of Directors",

But we also disappointed patients and prescribers alike due to supply challenges that we must learn from as we look to the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur company's strong commercial performance against a backdrop of continued disruption caused by the pandemic would not have been possible without the resilience and collaborative spirit shown by colleagues across the organisation and our many partners.\n\nThis momentum was driven by our portfolio of GLP-1 based therapies where buoyant demand for our semaglutide-based medicines Ozempic \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae contributed to a total GLP1 growth of 28% in 2021, thereby strengthening our global leadership in diabetes in the process.\n\nSuch was the demand in the US for another semaglutide product Wegovy \u00ae , that five weeks after launch, as many prescriptions were written for the anti-obesity medication as in the four years that followed the launch of its predecessor Saxenda \u00ae . This underscored the high unmet need among people living with obesity but also presented initial challenges for us in supply capacity - exacerbated when a key partner experienced issue with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in December.\n\nWhilst we continue to focus on providing treatment to alreadyinitiated patients, we are taking steps within our global production to enable us to fully meet US demand in the second half of this year and to enable much-anticipated launches in broader markets.\n\nImportantly, we continue to reach more patients in need around the world. Our Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children partnership, for example, has provided free, holistic diabetes care to nearly 32,000 children and adolescents living with type 1 diabetes in low- and middle-income countries. Our diabetes products now reach 34.6 million people worldwide, with more than 5 million receiving them through our access and affordability programmes.\n\nWe are also doing more than ever to mitigate our impact on the environment, with a 43% reduction in CO 2 emissions compared to pre-pandemic, and an action plan to drive emissions down further in transportation, which is our largest residual source of CO 2 . This includes converting our fleet of cars to electric vehicles, as well as working with a shipping partner to increasingly transport our products using biofuel.\n\nWe have bold ambitions to diversify our product pipeline into adjacent therapy areas such as NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) and cardiovascular disease, where we believe we can be among the best in the world. Our collaboration with Heartseed for stem cell-based heart failure therapy reflects these efforts and we expect to take a significant step forward by initiating the first human trials this year.\n\nOur acquisition of Dicerna, which develops RNAi-based therapies to selectively silence genes that cause or contribute to disease, demonstrates our ambition to innovate within both established and new therapy areas for Novo Nordisk. Our commitment to achieving further breakthroughs within diabetes remains as strong as ever. Driving this innovation requires creativity something I am convinced is fostered through inclusion. To enable this, we are making Novo Nordisk a more diverse and inclusive workplace in which both new and long-serving employees have the opportunity to achieve their full potential.\n\nI would like to thank all my colleagues around the globe for their hard work and commitment during another demanding year, as well as the Board of Directors and our shareholders for their continued support.\n\nLars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer",

The COVID-19 pandemic, access to care and the climate crisis have accelerated demands for the private sector to demonstrate how it adds value to society and mitigates long-term risks. Given Novo Nordisk's central position in the healthcare ecosystem, our company is at the forefront of these challenges - and we are stepping up our commitments to patients and society as we further integrate sustainability into everything we do.\n\n## Our key ESG topics\n\nIn 2021, we completed a thorough process aimed at addressing materiality and prioritising our key Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics. We identified key ESG topics across two dimensions: (1) how our activities impact society and planet and (2) how society and planet impact our activities. Those ESG topics that are of highest impact and materiality are covered in this integrated annual report. All applicable remaining ESG topics are covered via our reporting on relevant ESG standards and frameworks (please refer to the Sustainability Standards section on pages 22 and 23).\n\nThe 'Key ESG priorities' overview is meant to inform our ESG reporting in the future and will be refreshed regularly. Overall, we aim to progress towards zero environmental impact, be respected for adding value to society and ensure distinct core capabilities, evolve culture as well as maintain and build trust across the E, S and G dimensions.\n\n## 43%\n\ndecrease in our overall CO 2 emissions compared to pre-COVID levels in 2019\n\n## 31,846\n\nchildren reached through our Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme in 2021.

It adversely affects people who are already living with chronic diseases in particular. Health systems worldwide are increasingly acting on the urgent need to reduce their emissions and are working to become more resilient to climate change. All with a view to better adapt to future climate scenarios and protect populations from their impacts. In the fall of 2021, the COP26 Health Programme was launched to spearhead this transformation at a global level and we look forward to contributing our part.\n\nIt is clear that fast-growing and successful companies like Novo Nordisk have an obligation and a vital role to play in addressing the climate crisis and in helping to reverse the accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for today's warming world and an even warmer future. In 2021, we made a clear and ambitious pledge to reach net-zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2045.\n\nOur environmental performance in 2021 showed good progress compared to our 2019 baseline year by minimising the impact despite increasing production globally. We have made particular progress in the reduction of CO 2 emissions and the use of water in water scarce areas.",

Action is required now, which is why we have defined several ambitious climate and environmental targets in the near to medium-term future, leading to 2030.\n\nIn 2021, Novo Nordisk's CO 2 emissions from in-house operations and transport decreased by 43% compared to the 2019 level, bringing total emissions down to 174,000 tonnes of CO 2. This reduction was driven by our renewable energy projects and the impact of COVID-19 on travelling. 2019 is used as the baseline for CO 2 emissions as 2020 was impacted by the pandemic.\n\n## Total CO2 emissions from operations and transportation\n\n1,000\n\ntonnes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are building on our landmark 2020 achievement of using 100% renewable power across our global production network. The next step is to transform our business processes to eliminate the negative environmental footprint from all our operations. We plan to have zero net emissions of CO 2 from our own production facilities, global office buildings and laboratories by 2030, and are striving to reduce our emissions year-on-year.\n\n## Transportation\n\nTransportation is an important element in the environmental equation. We have made good progress towards achieving our target of transitioning to 100% electric company cars by 2030, with 50% of vehicles in our home market of Denmark now using electrical or plug-in technology. Entering into an agreement with Maersk to transport our products with CO 2 neutral ships was another important milestone. We are also minimising emissions from business air travel by using digital platforms for virtual collaboration wherever possible.\n\n## Supply Chain\n\nWe are now stepping up our work with supply chain partners to ensure they also use renewable power when producing for Novo Nordisk. Currently, direct suppliers representing 41% of supply chain CO 2 emissions have committed to using renewable power. 18% of these emissions have already been reduced due to an early shift to renewable power, cutting our supply chain emissions by approximately 50,000 tonnes. We expect all our direct suppliers to source 100% renewable power by 2030. Successful conversion to renewable power among all our suppliers would result in a further 300,000 tonnes of CO 2 being eliminated every year.\n\nAs part of our drive to encourage greater environmental responsibility among all the partners we do business with,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe made a significant commitment in 2021 to reach net-zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2045. Achieving this reduction calls for an ambitious plan to tackle Scope 3 CO 2 emissions, e.g., purchased goods and services, capital goods and employee commuting, among others. With more than 60,000 suppliers in our value chain, engaging with them all to progress towards net-zero emissions is a major undertaking. Our role in sharing lessons learnt with peers on",

We also recognise the need to minimise the use of fossil-based plastic, which is one of our major challenges, as we produce more than 600 million pre-filled pens every year, which are an essential daily companion for people living with diabetes. We must find good solutions to minimise the use of fossil-based plastic by innovating new products, shifting to more sustainable material and establishing recycling opportunities for our pre-filled pens globally.\n\nWe use more than 12,000 tonnes of plastic every year in the production of our devices. As medical waste, they are difficult to recycle. However, a pioneering take-back initiative piloted over the past year in Denmark shows that it is possible to reclaim and reuse the plastic that makes up three-quarters of these devices. Material from scrapped insulin pens has already been successfully used for the manufacture of lamps and office furniture. Over the next three years, we also aim to roll out pen recycling pilots in other markets, starting with the UK, France and Brazil.\n\nFurther out, we are investigating the potential to develop non fossil fuel-derived plastics by harnessing waste carbon and hydrogen from energy supply processes, including through the use of carbon capture.\n\nPlease refer to the Sustainability Standards section on pages 22 and 23 for more information on our reporting in the environmental dimension.\n\n## What are Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions?\n\nA company's greenhouse gas emissions can be classified into three scopes. These scopes are defined with reference to how directly a company influences the emissions - with Scope 3 being the hardest to monitor and address. Novo Nordisk's reporting of Scope 3 emissions is currently limited to product distribution and business flights. This means that the data shown below do not include a significant proportion of the Scope 3 emissions from our value chain.\n\n## Scope 1\n\nDirect emissions from companyowned and controlled resources (including emissions from production processes and transport)\n\n77,000 tonnes of CO2\n\n## Scope 2\n\nIndirect emissions from the generation of energy purchased from a utility provider (including electricity, steam, heat and cooling)\n\n16,000 tonnes of CO2\n\nTotal CO2 emissions from operations and transportation\n\n## Scope 3\n\nAll indirect emissions - not included in Scope 2 - that occur in the value chain of the reporting company (including both upstream and downstream emissions)\n\nNovo Nordisk's reporting of Scope 3 emissions is currently limited to product distribution and business flights\n\n81,000 tonnes of CO2\n\n174,000 tonnes",

While innovation is our core contribution to this fight, we know that complex inequalities in healthcare remain the biggest barrier. By playing an active role in improving access to innovative and affordable solutions for people with chronic conditions across the globe, our aim is to deliver real change in the communities we serve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith approximately 537 million adults in the world living with diabetes - a figure that is projected to rise to 783 million by 2045 if no action is taken - our Defeat Diabetes strategy is a cornerstone of our social responsibility work. We are striving to bend the curve of diabetes through product innovations that will improve lives, while at the same time working with partners to prevent the rise of new cases of both type 2 diabetes and obesity, as well as ensuring that vulnerable patients in every country can access and afford the care they need. With a growing health challenge of this magnitude, we know that we are nowhere close to defeating diabetes, but we are committed to doing nothing short of that and fortunately, we are not alone in this fight.\n\n## Improving access to life-changing care in lowand middle-income countries\n\nGiven our dedication to improve the lives of people with diabetes and other serious chronic diseases, including obesity, haemophilia and growth hormone disorders, we strive not only to identify new innovative treatments but also to support a strong healthcare system that ensures patient access and affordability for the medications they need.\n\nWe recognise that access to affordable medicines is a challenge for many people, and not only in low-income countries. This is why we are expanding our initiatives and partnerships to reach more underserved people with affordable care worldwide. Each initiative is tailored to the local context, unmet needs and health system challenges. Our access and affordability efforts now reach more than 5 million patients out of the 34.6 million who use our diabetes care products around the world.\n\nEnsuring not only that access to care for patients is achieved but that it is done in a sustainable manner is the most important consideration in our initiatives. This is why we always aim to\n\n## 5+ million\n\npatients reached via our access and affordability efforts, corresponding to approximately\n\n14% of all our diabetes patients\n\ninclude local health authorities, partners and civil society in all implementation activities. Shared ownership and involvement are critical to value creation for the end users and the health system, as well as for the sustainability of the solution.\n\nThe Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children partnership is one example of this work. The programme has to date provided free care to nearly 32,000 children and youth living with type 1 diabetes in low- and middle-income countries, putting it almost one-third along the way towards achieving our aspiration of reaching 100,000 children in low-resource settings by 2030. The partnership is present in 18 countries, following the addition of Ghana, Indonesia, Pakistan and Peru in 2021. Five more countries (Mozambique, Rwanda, Malawi, Jordan and Lebanon) are launching in early 2022 as part of an expanded partnership project with the World Diabetes Foundation.\n\nFor the many other vulnerable people who are living with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and who are struggling to access the care they need, we are leveraging our global organisation and using our presence on the ground to develop and implement country-based solutions. An example of this is the iCARE to Defeat Diabetes strategy launched in our Sub-Saharan business unit.",

Globally, vulnerability assessments were made in a total of 67 countries in 2021, up from 21 assessments in 2020. Based on these assessments, affordability plans are being implemented and around 82,000 people with diabetes have obtained access to diabetes care across Ethiopia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Syria, Peru and Panama.\n\nAs the world's leading supplier of insulin, we reaffirm our Access to Insulin Commitment ensuring affordable insulin for vulnerable patients. Under this commitment, we offer human insulin vials at a ceiling price of USD 3 to 76 countries, as well as to selected humanitarian organisations and UN agencies providing humanitarian relief. Long-term agreements are currently in place with 10 organisations. An estimated 1.7 million patients accessed care under this commitment in 2021, and an additional estimated 2.2 million patients were reached at or below the ceiling price in countries outside the commitment.\n\n## Improving access and affordability in the United States\n\nAffording healthcare is not only a challenge in low- and middleincome countries. In the United States, some people are also finding it increasingly hard to pay for treatments, including insulin. Ensuring access and affordability is a responsibility we share with all stakeholders in the United States' healthcare system. We are committed to doing our part, focusing on three main tenets.\n\nThe first tenet is finding ways to lower the out-of-pocket cost to patients with high-deductible health plans or those with no insurance. The issues driving patient affordability challenges are\n\ncomplex, and there is no single solution. In 2021, we provided 30 billion USD in sales discounts and rebates, amounting to 75% of US gross sales (74% in 2020), which primarily helped to secure broad formulary access for most patients with reasonable copays. In addition, we have continued to provide a full suite of affordability offerings through which we helped more than one million patients with diabetes in the US afford Novo Nordisk insulin in 2021. These affordability options include:\n\nMy$99Insulin: 30-day supply of a combination of Novo Nordisk insulin products (up to three vials or two packs of pens) for 99 USD for eligible patients.\n\nNNPI Unbranded Biologics: Unbranded versions of fast-acting (NovoLog \u00ae ) and premix insulin (NovoLog \u00ae Mix), available from Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. (NNPI), at a 50% list price discount versus branded versions.\n\nHuman insulin: Available for about 25 USD per vial at national pharmacies, including Walmart and CVS. Nearly 500,000 Americans are obtaining Novo Nordisk human insulin through these retailers.\n\nPatient Assistance Program: Offers free diabetes medication to people in need who meet certain eligibility criteria, including annual household income at or below 400% of governmentdefined poverty level. Over 50,000 Americans received free insulin annually from this program in 2021. This was expanded during the pandemic to offer 90-day free insulin to those impacted by COVID-19 job loss.\n\nImmediate Supply Program: A free, one-time, immediate supply of Novo Nordisk insulin (up to 3 vials or 2 packs of pens) to eligible patients who may be at risk of rationing.\n\nCopay Savings Cards: Defray high out-of-pocket costs for commercially insured patients. In 2021, Novo Nordisk provided ~$100 million in copay assistance for insulin to patients.\n\nReaching people where they are is vital, so we invested in broad communications to ensure awareness. We also made enhancements to create a positive user experience and make NovoCare.com, our one-stop patient access and affordability support resource, easy to use. NovoCare \u00ae helps support one patient every ten seconds.\n\nThe second tenet is working with all stakeholders to simplify and transform the healthcare system, while we work towards longer-term reform. We support policies that make insurance work better for patients. These include first-dollar coverage for chronic medications and changes to Part D, such as capping annual out-of-pocket costs, smoothing cost-sharing over the benefit year and passing manufacturer discounts on to patients.\n\nThe third tenet is limiting any potential future list price increases to no more than single-digit percentages annually.\n\n## US Product Portfolio 1 %, Change vs. Prior Year\n\n|                            | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| List Price Change - Avg. 2 | 6.9%   | 5.0%   | 5.5%   | 2.3%   | 2.0%   |\n| Net Price Change - Avg. 2  | -9.0%  | -8.6%  | -13.2% | -16.9% | -12.3% |\n\n## Total US Insulin Portfolio %, Change vs. Prior Year\n\n|                            | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| List Price Change - Avg. 2 | 6.3%   | 4.5%   | 4.4%   | 0.2%   | 0.0%   |\n| Net Price Change - Avg. 2  | -13.5% | -14.8% | -17.4% | -27.7% | -10.2% |\n\n- 1.

We are leveraging our expertise in research to bring life-saving products to more people in resource-poor settings. This includes ongoing work to deliver insulins with extended storage time outside of refrigeration in order to improve access and benefit patients and healthcare professionals living and working in humanitarian settings or countries with challenging weather conditions and limited access to refrigeration. As a first step, in 2021 we filed for EMA assessment of label updates on two of our human insulins to potentially enable them to be kept outside of refrigeration for up to four weeks before use.\n\n## Strengthening our prevention efforts\n\nPrevention is the other vital pillar in our strategy to defeat diabetes. Diabetes and obesity prevalence continue to grow on all continents and the burden on individuals, families, workplaces and society is large and growing. Ensuring access to our medicines will help reduce the burden for people with chronic disease but we must also work to prevent these diseases from developing in the first place. Our aim is to find, pilot and scale effective interventions to prevent both diabetes and obesity. These efforts, which explore innovations in place-based interventions, digital solutions and new ways of collaborating with financial services sector participants in support of common objectives, are evidence-based and partnership-driven for the greatest possible impact.\n\nOur work in collaboration with UNICEF to prevent childhood overweight and obesity is one example of this. However, we also continue to expand our successful public-private partnership, Cities Changing Diabetes, which is designed to address diabetes and obesity prevention amongst vulnerable populations in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nurban settings. In 2021, Cities Changing Diabetes reached more places than ever before, with 41 cities now participating in the initiative, up from 36 in 2020. These cities are home to more than 220 million people. In Cities Changing Diabetes, some of the activities that cities engage in include health promotion, COVID-19 response, working with community organisations to reach isolated and vulnerable populations, improving bicycling and walking infrastructure and addressing challenges in access to healthy food.\n\n## A diverse and inclusive workplace\n\nAs a global employer, we are of the view that offering an inclusive and diverse working environment is an integrated part of being a sustainable business. We fundamentally believe that diversity of people and inclusive leadership drive value for Novo Nordisk by increasing innovation, enabling a diverse line of thought and providing all employees with equitable opportunities to realise their potential.\n\n## Launching aspirational targets\n\nAt Novo Nordisk, we believe that diversity is any dimension that differentiates people and enables a diverse line of thought - for example background, education, experience, ethnicity, race or age, nationality, disability status or sexual orientation. Whilst legal constraints mean we currently do not have consistent global measures on all the aspects of diversity, gender diversity is a space in which we have identified a need to set an aspirational target to ensure accountability among leaders and accelerate progress. As of 2021, women fill 43% of all leadership positions and 36% of senior leadership positions 1 at Novo Nordisk. While several initiatives have been launched to progress gender diversity in senior leadership positions, we are not yet satisfied with the current state.\n\n- 1.

In 2021, we announced a new global parental leave policy. From January 2022, we will offer a minimum of eight weeks paid leave within the first year of becoming a parent to all non-birthing parents globally, regardless of gender. Our ambition is that recognition of the non-birthing parents' right to leave will result in greater inclusion and equality for parents - both at work and at home.\n\nIn addition, we conduct yearly equal pay reviews and take mitigating actions in case of any identified pay gaps. Out of the 34,000 positions 2 covered in the pay review in 2021, we identified 1% with an equal pay gap 3 and have taken corrective action. Of the positions where an equal pay gap was identified, 152 are occupied by female employees and 131 are occupied by male employees, indicating that there is no structural gender bias in the way we pay.\n\nFinally, in 2021 we introduced our global 'Inclusion Index' as part of our annual employee engagement survey. The index is a numerical indicator of how our employees rate the state of inclusion at Novo Nordisk. In 2021, 78% of employees rated the statements about inclusion favourably. The score is below average when benchmarked against other highly engaged organisations. As a result, we have encouraged all leaders to engage their employees in dialogue around how to improve local inclusion and to identify concrete actions.\n\n- 2.  Excluding some populations and locations due to local regulations such as in the US where a local process is in place\n- 3.

To ensure we consider the local context, drive impact at all levels and hold our leaders accountable for driving progress, all our senior leaders across the company have been asked to define local diversity and inclusion aspirations and associated action plans.\n\nWe expect all our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders by being committed to building diverse teams of complementary strengths, valuing diverse perspectives and creating a psychologically safe space in which all employees feel free to speak up.\n\nProgress of diversity and inclusion has been anchored in both short-term and long-term incentive programmes and we follow up and track progress on a regular basis.\n\nPlease refer to note 8.5 on Gender diversity on page 89 for further information.

The first dimension is Corporate Governance and covers our governance and ownership structure. Governing Processes, the second dimension, refers to how we run our business. Sustainability Standards, which is about how we oversee and prioritise our sustainability and ESG agenda, is the third dimension.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\n## Governance Structure\n\nThe shareholders of Novo Nordisk exercise their rights at the general meeting, which is the supreme governing body of the company. The general meeting inter alia adopts the company's Articles of Association, approves the annual report and elects the Board of Directors.\n\nAny shareholder has the right to raise questions at general meetings. Resolutions can generally be passed by a simple majority. However, resolutions to amend the Articles of Association require two-thirds of the votes cast and capital represented, unless other adoption requirements are imposed by the Danish Companies Act.\n\nNovo Nordisk has a two-tier management structure consisting of the Board of Directors and Executive Management. The governance structure and rules of Novo Nordisk are further described in our Articles of Association and our Corporate Governance Report, both of which are available at novonordisk.com.\n\nNovo Holdings A/S, a Danish company wholly owned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, holds the majority of votes at general meetings.\n\nThe combination of foundation ownership and stock listing enables Novo Nordisk to embark on long-term sustainable strategies while maintaining short-term transparency on performance. Our foundation ownership supports the overarching imperative to be both commercially successful and responsive to the wider needs of society.\n\nThe objective of the Novo Nordisk Foundation is to provide a stable basis for the commercial and research activities of Novo Nordisk as well as Novozymes and support broader scientific, humanitarian and social purposes. Please refer to page 7 for an illustration of how we create value for society in conjunction with the Novo Nordisk Foundation. For more information about the ownership structure of Novo Nordisk, see page 37.\n\n## Corporate Governance Reporting\n\nNovo Nordisk reports in accordance with the Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations designated by Nasdaq Copenhagen as well as the Corporate Governance Standards of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to foreign private issuers. In 2021 Novo Nordisk complied with the Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations as we either complied with or explained our approach to the recommendations. You can find further information about our corporate governance practices in our 2021 Corporate Governance Report.\n\nCorporate Governance Report in accordance with section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act: www.novonordisk.com/about/corporate-governance.html\n\nNovo Nordisk has prepared a separate Remuneration Report describing the remuneration awarded or due during 2021 to the Board and Executives registered with the Danish Business Authority. The Remuneration Report is submitted to the Annual General Meeting for an advisory vote.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy and Remuneration Report are available at: www.novonordisk.com/about/corporate-governance.html\n\nReporting on diversity is included in the social responsibility section on pages 17 to 19, in the social performance section on page 89, and for the Board of Directors also in the Corporate Governance Report. Novo Nordisk's diversity policy is available at novonordisk.com.\n\n## Disclosure regarding change of control provisions\n\nThe EU Takeover Bids Directive, as partially implemented by the Danish Financial Statements Act, requires listed companies to disclose information that may be of interest to the market and potential take-over bidders, in particular in relation to disclosure of change-of-control provisions in material contracts.\n\nNovo Nordisk discloses that the Group has one significant agreement with a US payer which takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of control of the Group. If effected, a takeover could - at the discretion of the relevant counterparty lead to the termination of such agreement. Given the ownership structure of Novo Nordisk, the risk is considered to be remote.\n\nIn relation to the registered management of Novo Nordisk A/S, the current employment contracts allow for severance payments of up to 24 months' fixed base salary plus pension contributions in the event of a merger, acquisition or takeover of Novo Nordisk.",

We use a unique, systematic approach known as facilitation to ensure that everyone lives up to the Novo Nordisk Way. In 2021, 34 facilitations and eight special assignments were completed. Any issues are addressed locally and a consolidated report is shared with the Board of Directors and Executive Management.\n\nIn 2021, five units were found not to be operating in full accordance with the Novo Nordisk Way, a similar percentage to 2020 but still a concern. In most cases the root causes were grounded in leadership style and behaviours not living up to the Novo Nordisk Way. There were no findings around quality or business ethics mindset.\n\n## Company reputation\n\nThe Novo Nordisk reputation score among key stakeholders (i.e., the informed general public, people with diabetes, people with obesity, healthcare professionals and diabetes specialists) is an indicator of the extent to which we live up to society's expectations.\n\nWe achieved a reputation score of 82.6 points in 2021 measured on a scale of 0-100. As the only company among our selected peers, Novo Nordisk enjoys a score above 80 points for Products & Services, which is the most important driver of reputation across all stakeholder groups, and thus the key driver of the positive overall result.\n\n## Business ethics\n\nOur approach to business ethics is acting with integrity and in compliance with the Novo Nordisk Way, our Business Ethics\n\n- 1. We create value by having a patient centred business approach.\n- 2. We set ambitious goals and strive for excellence.\n- 3. We are accountable for our financial, environmental and social performance.\n- 4. We provide innovation to the benefit of our stakeholders.\n- 5. We build and maintain good relations with our key stakeholders.\n- 6. We treat everyone with respect.\n- 7. We focus on personal performance and development.\n- 8. We have a healthy and engaging working environment.\n- 9. We strive for agility and simplicity in everything we do.\n- 10. We never compromise on quality and business ethics.\n\nCode of Conduct and international and local standards for responsible business conduct. Business ethics covers anti-fraud, anti-bribery, anti off-label promotion, transparency in dealing with healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations, the protection of personal data, as well as respect for human rights with the aim of minimising any potential risks to our patients, business, people and stakeholders.\n\nAnnual training in business ethics is mandatory for all employees, including all new hires. In 2021, 98% of employees completed and documented their training, with the remaining 2% missing mainly due to employees being on leave. In 2021, 37 business ethics reviews were completed with 129 findings, compared with 32 reviews with 107 findings in 2020. Consolidated findings are reported to our Executive Management and the Audit Committee.\n\nGroup Internal Audit assesses that the level of business ethics compliance is sound. Management action plans and closure of findings progressed as planned and there were no overdue management actions or findings at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2021, data ethics principles were enhanced and will be implemented through policies and trainings across the organisation in 2022. Our data ethics principles support ethical decision-making when using data across the value chain. We further strengthened the global integration of data protection and human rights risks in the business ethics risk management process. Please find more information at novonordisk.com.\n\n## Product quality and supplier audits\n\nIn 2021, as in 2020, Novo Nordisk had no failed inspections among those resolved by the relevant health authority at year-end. However, a contract manufacturer filling syringes for Wegovy \u00ae failed an inspection causing disruption in the supply of Wegovy \u00ae . During the year, 97 inspections were conducted, compared with 77 in 2020. At year-end, 86 inspections were passed and 11 were unresolved, as final inspection reports had not been received or the final authority acceptance was pending. Follow-up on unresolved inspections continues in 2022. Please see note 9.4 on page 91 for further information.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 253 supplier audits were conducted to assess compliance levels with our supplier standards.\n\nIn 2021, we had 1 product recall from the market.

To ensure that the internal financial audit function operates independently of Executive Management, its charter, audit plan and budget are approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee must approve the appointment, remuneration and dismissal of the head of the internal audit function. As part of our ESG responsibility, the Audit Committee also oversees our ESG reporting. We thereby ensure that our ESG reporting is subject to the same robust governance that applies to our financial reporting.\n\n## Sustainability Standards\n\n## Sustainability standards and performance\n\nWe report on our ESG performance in accordance with relevant disclosure standards, including those of the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF)/ Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).\n\nWe strive to adhere to the disclosure requirements of the VRF/ SASB, as they apply to the pharmaceuticals industry. We do this to demonstrate our commitment to being transparent and accountable for how we operate. Having further assessed our adherence and disclosure in 2021, we are now fully or partially\n\naligned with 23 of 25 metrics. Our VRF/ SASB adherence document is available on our ESG Portal at novonordisk.com.\n\nUsing the TCFD framework, we continue to take a stepwise approach to incorporating material climate-related riskassessments into our governance, strategy and execution on climate and environmentally related initiatives. This includes the consideration of operational risks related to the environment, such as current and emerging environmental and climaterelated litigation, access to resources, such as water and raw materials, and exposure to acute physical risks that could disrupt production. As recommended by the TCFD, we work to identify, assess and mitigate short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks within our operations and supply chain.\n\nIn addition to the TCFD, we have been working with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for a number of years, where our CO 2 emissions reduction targets for 2030 are validated. We believe external validation and transparency are paramount measures to ensure rapid progress towards a decarbonised\n\nfuture. We therefore welcome that SBTi launched a new net-zero standard in October 2021 and we have committed to have our net-zero CO 2 emissions in 2045 target validated by them in 2022.\n\nFor the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we focus our efforts on Goal 3, 'health' and Goal 12, 'responsible consumption and production', as this is where we believe we can maximise our positive impact.\n\nWe will publish further information on our adherence to selected standards on our ESG Portal on an ongoing basis. This applies to the VRF/ SASB, TCFD and WEF's Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in particular. Please also refer to the consolidated ESG statement in this Annual Report and to novonordisk.com for more information on our sustainability governance.\n\n## ESG \"rankers and raters\"\n\nWe perform on par with peers according to selected raters but with room to improve, particularly with respect to S&P Global and Access to Medicine Index.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To enable us to drive change for society throughout another century, we are exploring higher levels of innovation by deploying novel technology platforms across more therapy areas than at any point in our history. In doing so, we are building on our heritage within diabetes care with the ambition to become the world's foremost cardiometabolic disease company.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the mounting social, economic and human burden of serious chronic diseases that affect hundreds of millions of people. By exposing the vulnerability of these populations, it has highlighted the complex interactions between communicable and non-communicable diseases, underscoring the need for ground-breaking innovation.\n\nWe are meeting the challenge by creating an increasingly broad pipeline of life-changing products in areas including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and Alzheimer's disease. The innovations we are pursuing today take our company into more therapy areas and\n\n## We are active in late stage assets across all our therapy areas\n\nmore technologies than ever before, not least within the rapidly evolving cardiometabolic disease space. This journey can deliver for those who for decades have relied on our innovation within diabetes and haemophilia, but also in the future may have the potential to deliver for others at risk of diseases such as NASH and dyslipidaemia (high cholesterol).\n\nTo achieve our ambitions, we will not only leverage our existing capabilities in protein and peptide engineering and delivery, but also invest in new platforms such as cell therapy, RNA interference and gene editing. Much of this work will be done through partnerships.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To make this possible, we have re-organised R&D operations, creating a Research & Early Development unit to fuel and validate our early pipeline, and a patient solutions-focused Development organisation to take our most promising candidates forward.\n\nThroughout this work, we are focused on the power of digitalisation and connected healthcare. We are evolving from a molecule-focused pharmaceutical company to a patient solutions-oriented enterprise where drug, device, digital, diagnostics and data are fully integrated to deliver leading treatment solutions to patients. This '5D' approach will bring improvements right along the value chain, from more convenient and better products and devices for patients - who can check and track their health status in real time via apps and other systems - to faster, more efficient product development.\n\nOur electronic Patient Interaction Device, for example, allows the collection of real-time clinical trial data. This technology is already being used by more than 4,000 patients in 36 countries and forms a central plank of our 'moonshot' aspiration of being able to submit new products for market authorisation in four key markets within four days of the last patient visiting a pivotal trial site.\n\nThis is a journey that will take time to complete, but it is already creating an innovative pipeline of differentiated projects that has the potential to secure long-term sustainable growth of our offering to patients beyond 2030.\n\nIn the meantime, our R&D is continuing to deliver significant advances. Major milestones in the past year include the US approval of Wegovy \u00ae - a pivotal new treatment of obesity and the initiation of phase 3 clinical trials investigating oral semaglutide for both obesity and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n## Entering a new century of diabetes innovation\n\nIn the 101 years since the discovery of insulin, there have been many advances in the treatment of diabetes, yet the number of people living with the condition continues to climb. As a result, there remains an urgent need for better, more patient-focused therapies to continue to reduce the burden of diabetes.\n\nOur potential future treatment and device innovations may offer this step change in care. They include the once-weekly basal insulin icodec, which entered final-stage phase 3 development in November 2020, which has the potential to offer patients greater convenience than the current option of once-daily basal insulins. We have also progressed our work on glucose-sensitive insulin, which is designed to activate when glucose levels rise, thereby potentially providing better disease control and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia.\n\nBeyond insulin, we have continued the rollout of Rybelsus \u00ae , our once-daily oral GLP-1 therapy, while once-weekly semaglutide 2.0 mg for type 2 diabetes received a positive opinion recommending marketing authorisation in the EU in November 2021, and has been re-submitted for US regulatory approval following the receipt of a Refusal to File letter from the US Food & Drug Administration in March 2021. We have also launched two phase 2 trials investigating fixed-dose combination therapies for type 2 diabetes  - one focusing on semaglutide in combination with cagrilintide (which is also being explored\n\nMoustapha Djamil Ciss\u00e9 is living with type 1 diabetes and is enrolled in our Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme, Senegal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfor patients living with obesity), and the other looking at combination of semaglutide and GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide).\n\n## Leading the treatment of obesity\n\nWe are making major strides in tackling obesity, both with the successful launch of our pioneering injectable GLP-1 product Wegovy \u00ae in the US and the advancement in our pipeline of next-generation therapies that we hope will deliver even greater weight loss efficacy.",

The implications of such weight loss can be profound since people with obesity face a range of health risks, from cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, to severe symptoms and complications of COVID-19.\n\nOur ultimate aspiration is to close the gap between current pharmacological treatment options and bariatric surgery through combination therapies. This work will take a significant step forward next year with the planned initiation of a large phase 3\n\n- 4.  Based on the trial product estimand (secondary statistical approach): treatment effect if all people adhered to treatment and did not initiate other anti-obesity therapies. When using a treatment policy estimand, 15-17% weight loss was reported\n\nstudy looking at a combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide. Cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin analogue, works by reducing the signaling of hunger to the brain, and early phase 1b data suggests that its combination with semaglutide provides additive weight loss efficacy without compromising gastrointestinal tolerability.\n\nAlongside this, we have initiated a phase 3 trial of high-dose semaglutide 50 mg as an oral treatment for obesity. This would offer patients a new option and could potentially address issues associated with injections.\n\n## Innovating in rare diseases\n\nThe rare blood and endocrine disorders that our Biopharm business seeks to treat are areas of continuing high unmet need, and we are advancing several key new products in our pipeline. This includes the planned initiation of phase 3 development of Mim8, a next-generation subcutaneous prophylactic treatment for haemophilia A, in 2022. We are also awaiting the results from phase 3 trials with concizumab in patients with haemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors, while a phase 3 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of concizumab for pediatric use is expected to be initiated in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, we are seeking to harness disruptive technologies such as gene editing and RNA interference to develop nextgeneration treatments for rare diseases. In December, we announced the completion of the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals - a Boston-based biotech firm specialising in RNAi therapeutics for rare and common diseases. The acquisition builds on a successful collaboration initiated with Dicerna in 2019 to discover and develop selective gene-silencing therapies for liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases using Dicerna's proprietary RNAi technology platform, and we will now seek to expand the application of this innovative technology across all our therapy areas.\n\n## Broadening our horizons across serious chronic diseases\n\nWe are actively widening our therapeutic focus as we explore a more holistic approach to cardiometabolic diseases - a trend exemplified by the potential of semaglutide to improve outcomes in a wide range of disorders.\n\nSignificantly, the push into new areas includes the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, where we are testing oral semaglutide 14 mg in two phase 3a trials that will run for three years. We have also started a phase 3 programme with semaglutide in patients with NASH, while two major phase 3 trials are exploring the potential of semaglutide in treating heart disease.\n\nBeyond semaglutide, our antibody drug ziltivekimab has entered phase 3 development for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and we are exploring a novel oral PCSK9i agent for high cholesterol in phase 2. Meanwhile, new partnerships with Prothena and Heartseed have strengthened our pipeline in cardiovascular disease, with the latter building our expertise in the exciting new field of cell therapy.\n\n## Strategic Aspirations 2025 Innovation and therapeutic focus\n\n- -  Further raise the innovation-bar for diabetes treatment\n- -  Develop a leading portfolio of superior treatment solutions for obesity\n- -  Strengthen and progress the Biopharm pipeline\n- -  Establish presence in other serious chronic diseases focusing on Cardiovascular disease (CVD); Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)",

The increased risk of serious illness from coronavirus among people living with diabetes and obesity and other serious chronic diseases - and the growing incidence of these conditions around the world has made delivering our products to patients more imperative than ever.\n\nWe are increasingly providing a holistic solution to the challenges of inter-linked cardiometabolic diseases - such as diabetes, obesity and other serious chronic diseases - by offering products to patients, healthcare professionals and payers. In this way we are driving change and adding value for society, while at the same time building a sustainable business for the future.\n\nDespite the economic and social disruptions caused by the pandemic, we successfully launched important new products and grew market share in 2021, allowing us to make progress across our strategic aspirations. This robust performance was underpinned by strong demand for our diabetes treatments and our new obesity medication, Wegovy \u00ae .\n\nWe are working towards achieving a global diabetes market value share of one third by 2025. We are also committed to consolidating and expanding our leading position in obesity treatment, while our Biopharm division is building a diversified platform for sustainable growth.\n\n30.1%\n\nValue market share for diabetes\n\n8,400\n\nDKK million sales in obesity treatment\n\n<!-- image -->",

This shift was necessitated by the pandemic, but it has now become standard practice across the organisation. Today, we are embracing virtual customer interactions in multiple settings and developing new digital competences as we apply a market-fit approach to our operations.\n\n## A watershed year in obesity therapy\n\nObesity was an important stand-out in 2021, both for patients and for our business. The US launch of Wegovy \u00ae in June 2021 marked the start of a new era in obesity care and underscored the value that our innovations can bring to society.  The exceptional demand for the therapy - exceeding all expectations - was testament to the high unmet need among people living with the disease, while the fact that our medicine helps patients achieve unprecedented weight loss, fuelled extensive media attention. Acceptance by payers was also highly encouraging, with US commercial formulary access now around 73%.\n\nAs a result of this exceptional interest, initial demand for Wegovy \u00ae exceeded supply, requiring careful management to ensure continuity of care for individual patients who had already started treatment. Despite increasing production efforts, additional supply chain challenges encountered towards the end of 2021 mean we do not expect to be able to meet demand in the US until the second half of 2022 - with relatively few new patients expected to be able to initiate treatment as a result.\n\nOutside the US, our first-generation obesity product Saxenda \u00ae has now been launched in 62 countries. Better\n\nunderstanding of the need to address obesity is winning healthcare system reimbursement in select sub-populations across a growing number of markets, creating a solid platform for the increasing uptake of anti-obesity medications.\n\nWe are the global leader in obesity treatment, with a value market share of 77.8% of branded prescription sales, and there is substantial scope for further growth in the years ahead. There are currently around 650 million people living with obesity, and in 10 years the total is likely to be closer to 1 billion.\n\n## Diabetes value market share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|             |             | 52.7%       |\n|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 47.5% 50.4% | 47.5% 50.4% | 47.5% 50.4% |\n| 44.5%       | 44.3%       | 43.8%       |\n| 28.6%       | 29.3%       | 30.1%       |\n| 2019        | 2020        | 2021        |\n\nSource: IQVIA data\n\nKara Richadrson Whitely lives with obesity in the US.

There is a clear shift to greater use of GLP-1 therapies around the world and this segment's value share of the total diabetes market has increased to 26.5% compared with 21.9% 12 months ago. We continue to be the global market leader with our type 2 diabetes products Rybelsus \u00ae , Ozempic \u00ae and Victoza \u00ae , with a 52.7% share by value. Ozempic \u00ae , our once-weekly injectable semaglutide, is now available in 69 countries - including China - and Rybelsus \u00ae , our oral formulation of semaglutide, has been launched in 30 countries.\n\nIncreasingly, healthcare providers are demanding diabetes treatments that not only control blood glucose levels but also have cardiovascular benefits. The fact that Ozempic \u00ae has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with placebo in people living with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) is particularly important in this regard.\n\nInsulin sales in 2021 were mixed, with the growth driven by International Operations partially offset by lower sales in the US However, 2021 was a landmark year for digital health in our diabetes business, with the first launch of our smart insulin pens in Sweden and Germany followed by the UK launch in January 2022. By automatically recording insulin dosing information and viewing this alongside blood sugar information, the pens allow patients to better manage their disease with greater accuracy. This is a key part of our drive to provide more personalised treatment guidance to ensure patients using insulin maximise their time in the correct glycaemic range.\n\n- Sales as reported Growth at CER\n\nDKK\n\nbillion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biopharm sales\n\n- Sales as reported Growth at CER\n\nDKK\n\nbillion\n\n25\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe smart pen initiative also paves the way for the digitalisation of the patient journey in other therapy areas in the future. The aim is simple: to use smart technology to help patients lead as normal a life as possible.\n\n## Further growth in Biopharm\n\nIn Biopharm, sales growth across International and North America Operations was driven by our treatments for rare blood disorders, including the newly launched products Esperoct \u00ae and Refixia \u00ae , as well as NovoEight \u00ae and NovoSeven \u00ae . Sales of haemophilia A and haemophilia B products increased by 23% and 23% respectively.\n\nOverall demand for rare endocrine disorder products was flat, with an increase in international sales offset by a decline in North America. We remain the market leader in the global human growth disorder market with a value share of 36.3%, against 35.6% a year ago, reflecting the new indications that have been approved for our products and the global roll-out of our next-generation injection device.\n\n## Strategic Aspirations 2025 Commercial execution\n\n- -  Strengthen Diabetes leadership - aim at global value market share of more than 1/3\n- -  Strengthen Obesity leadership and double current sales (based on reported sales in 2019)\n- -  Secure a sustained growth outlook for Biopharm",

Ozempic \u00ae has now been launched in 72 countries.\n\nVictoza \u00ae sales decreased by 20% measured in Danish kroner and by 18% at CER to DKK 15,054 million as the GLP-1 market is moving towards once-weekly and tablet-based treatments. The sales decline was driven by North America Operations, EMEA and Rest of World, partially offset by higher sales in Region China.\n\n## Insulin sales\n\nSales of insulin decreased by 1% measured in Danish kroner and increased by 1% at CER to DKK 56,006 million. Sales growth at CER was driven by increased sales in International Operations, partially offset by declining sales in the US.\n\n## Obesity care\n\nSales of Obesity care products, Saxenda \u00ae and Wegovy \u00ae , increased by 50% measured in Danish kroner and by 55% at CER to DKK 8,400 million.

The decline in gross margin reflects lower realised prices in the US, a negative currency impact of 0.2 percentage points and amortisation of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Emisphere Technologies Inc. in 2020. This is countered by a positive product mix driven by increased GLP1 sales and productivity improvements in line with the strategic aspiration of driving operational efficiencies.\n\nSales and distribution costs increased by 12% measured in Danish kroner and by 15% at CER to DKK 37,008 million.

In International Operations, promotional spend is related to launch activities for Rybelsus \u00ae and Ozempic \u00ae as well as Obesity care market development activities. In North America Operations, the cost increase is driven by promotional activities for Rybelsus \u00ae and Ozempic \u00ae as well as market development activities for Obesity care and launch costs for Wegovy \u00ae , partially offset by lower promotional spend related to insulin.\n\nResearch and development costs increased by 15% measured in Danish kroner and by 16% at CER to DKK 17,772 million. Increased activities within Other serious chronic diseases are driving the cost increase reflecting the progression of the pipeline within cardiovascular disease and NASH. The growth is impacted by amortisation of the priority review voucher for Wegovy \u00ae in the US in 2020.\n\nAdministration costs increased by 2% measured in Danish kroner and by 4% at CER to DKK 4,050 million, reflecting low spend in 2020 due to COVID-19 impact on activities.\n\nOther operating income and expenses (net) was DKK 332 million compared with DKK 460 million in 2020.\n\nOperating profit increased by 8% measured in Danish kroner and by 13% at CER to DKK 58,644 million.\n\n## Financial items (net) and tax\n\nFinancial items (net) showed a net gain of DKK 436 million compared with a net loss of DKK 996 million in 2020.\n\nIn line with Novo Nordisk's treasury policy, the most significant foreign exchange risks for Novo Nordisk have been hedged,\n\nprimarily through foreign exchange forward contracts. The foreign exchange result was a net gain of DKK 344 million compared with a net loss of DKK 747 million in 2020. This reflects gains on hedged currencies, primarily the US dollar.\n\nAs per the end of December 2021, a negative market value of financial contracts of approximately DKK 1.7 billion has been deferred for recognition in 2022.\n\nThe effective tax rate is 19.2% in 2021 compared with an effective tax rate of 20.7% in 2020, mainly reflecting nonrecurring impact from acquisitions in 2020 and 2021.\n\nNet profit increased by 13% to DKK 47,757 million and diluted earnings per share increased by 15% to DKK 20.74 DKK.\n\n## Cash flow and capital allocation\n\nFree cash flow was DKK 29.3 billion compared with DKK 28.6 billion in 2020 supporting the strategic aspiration to deliver attractive capital allocation to shareholders. The increase is driven by higher net profit and higher provisions for rebates in the US partially driven by changed distribution policy for the 340B programme. This increase is partially countered by an unfavourable impact from change in working capital.\n\nCapital expenditure for property, plant and equipment was DKK 6.3 billion compared with DKK 5.8 billion in 2020.\n\nNovo Nordisk's financial reserves were DKK 16.1 billion by end of December 2021 comprising cash at bank, marketable securities (measured at fair value based on active market data) and undrawn credit facilities less overdrafts and loans repayable within 12 months.",

The guidance reflects expectations for sales growth in both International Operations and in North America Operations, mainly driven by Diabetes and Obesity care. Within Obesity care, the guidance reflects an expectation of meeting the demand for Wegovy \u00ae in the US in the second half of 2022.\n\nIntensifying competition within both Diabetes care and Biopharm as well as an estimated negative impact on global sales growth of around 3 percentage points from Volume Based Procurement of insulin in China are also reflected in the guidance. Furthermore, continued pricing pressure within Diabetes care, especially in the US, is expected to negatively\n\nimpact sales development. Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is now expected to be around 5 percentage points higher than at CER.\n\nOperating profit growth is expected to be 4% to 8% at CER. The expectation for operating profit growth primarily reflects the sales growth outlook and continued investments in current and future growth drivers within research and development and commercial. Across the operating units, commercial investments are related to the continued roll-out of Ozempic \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae as well as global investments in building the anti-obesity market and the launch of Wegovy \u00ae . Furthermore, resources are allocated to both early and late-stage pipeline activities. The acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc. is negatively impacting operating profit growth by around 3 percentage points due to higher operating costs and amortisations of intangible assets . Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is expected to be around 7 percentage points higher than at CER.\n\nFor 2022, Novo Nordisk expects financial items (net) to amount to a loss of around DKK 2.8 billion, mainly reflecting losses associated with foreign exchange hedging contracts.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2022 is expected to be in the range of 20-22%.\n\nCapital expenditure is expected to be around DKK 12 billion in 2022 primarily relating to investments in additional capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production at existing manufacturing sites. The expected increase in capital expenditure reflects progress of R&D projects based on the oral technology platform.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment losses are expected to be around DKK 6.5 billion.\n\nThe free cash flow is expected to be DKK 50-55 billion. The increase in free cash flow compared to 2021 reflects the impact from the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals in 2021. All of the above expectations are based on assumptions that the global or regional macroeconomic and political environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk during 2022, including the potential implications from major healthcare reforms and legislative changes as well as outcome of legal cases including litigations related to the 340B Drug Pricing Programme in the US, and that the currency exchange rates, especially the US dollar, will remain at the current level versus the Danish krone. Neither does the guidance include the financial implications of any significant business development transactions during the remainder of 2022.\n\nNovo Nordisk has hedged expected net cash flows in a number of invoicing currencies and, all other things being equal, movements in key invoicing currencies will impact Novo Nordisk's operating profit as outlined in note 4.3 in the financial statements.\n\n| Expectations are as reported,   if not otherwise stated                                                                            | Expectations   2 February 2022                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Sales growth                                                                                                                       |                                               |\n| at CER                                                                                                                             | 6% to 10%                                     |\n| as reported                                                                                                                        | Around 5 percentage points higher than at CER |\n| Operating profit growth                                                                                                            |                                               |\n| at CER                                                                                                                             | 4% to 8%                                      |\n| as reported                                                                                                                        | Around 7 percentage points higher than at CER |\n| Financial items (net)                                                                                                              | Loss of around DKK 2.8 billion                |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                                                                 | 20% to 22%                                    |\n| Capital expenditure (PP&E)                                                                                                         | Around DKK 12.0 billion                       |\n| Depreciation, amortisation  and impairment losses                                                                                  | Around DKK 6.5 billion                        |\n| Free cash flow (excluding impact  from business development)                                                     DKK 50-55 billion |                                               |",

The A and B shares are calculated in units of DKK 0.20, amounting to 2.31 billion shares. The A share capital, consisting of 537 million shares, has a nominal value of DKK 107,487,200 and the B share capital, consisting of 1,773 million shares, has a nominal value of DKK 354,512,800. Each A share carries 200 votes and each B share carries 20 votes. Novo Nordisk's B shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as American Depository Receipts (ADRs).\n\nThe general meeting has authorised the Board of Directors to distribute extraordinary dividends, issue new shares in accordance with the Articles of Association and repurchase shares in accordance with authorizations granted.\n\nThe company's A shares are not listed and are held by Novo Holdings A/S 5 , a Danish public limited liability company whollyowned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. According to the Articles of Association of the Foundation, the A shares cannot be divested.\n\nSpecial rights attached to A shares include pre-emptive subscription rights in the event of an increase in the A share capital and pre-emptive purchase rights in the event of a sale of A shares, while B shares take priority for liquidation proceedings. A shares take priority for dividends below 0.5%, and B shares take priority for dividends between 0.5 and 5%. However, in practice, A and B shares receive the same amount of dividend per share.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, Novo Holdings A/S also held a B share capital of nominally DKK 22,103,800. Together with the A shares, Novo Holdings A/S's total ownership amounted to nominally DKK 129,591,000. Novo Holdings A/S's ownership is reflected in the 'Ownership structure' chart.\n\nThere is no complete record of all shareholders; however, based on available sources of information, as of 31 December 2021 it is estimated that shares were geographically distributed as shown in the 'Geographical split of shareholders' chart. As of 31 December 2021, the free float of listed B shares was 92.01% (of which approximately 10.1% are listed as ADRs), excluding Novo Holdings A/S's holding and Novo Nordisk's holding of treasury shares. As of 31 December 2021, Novo Holdings A/S and Novo Nordisk's holding of B shares equaled 141,618,276 shares and had a nominal value of DKK 28,323,655. For details about the share capital, see note 4.2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nNovo Nordisk's Board of Directors and Executive Management consider that the current capital and share structure of Novo Nordisk serve the interests of the shareholders and the company well. Novo Nordisk's capital structure strategy offers a balance between long-term shareholder value creation and competitive shareholder return in the short term.\n\nThe capital structure has been adjusted following Novo Nordisk's Eurobond issuance with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 1.3 billion. In addition, Novo Nordisk announced the acquisition of Dicerna on 18 November 2021, worth DKK 18 billion net of cash which is mainly debt-financed.",

The final dividend for 2020 paid in March 2021 was equal to DKK 5.85 per A and B share of DKK 0.20 including ADRs. The total dividend for 2020 was DKK 9.10 per A and B share of DKK 0.20, corresponding to a payout ratio of 50.0%, which was in line with the 2020 pharma peer group average of 50.6%.\n\nIn August 2021, an interim dividend was paid equaling DKK 3.50 per A and B share of DKK 0.20 including ADRs. For 2021, the Board of Directors will propose a final dividend of DKK 6.90 to\n\nbe paid in March 2022, equivalent to a total dividend for 2021 of DKK 10.40 and a payout ratio of 49.6%. The company expects to distribute an interim dividend in August 2022. Further information regarding this interim dividend will be announced in connection with the financial report for the first six months of 2022. Dividends are paid from distributable reserves. Novo Nordisk does not pay a dividend on its holding of treasury shares.\n\n## Share repurchase programme for 2021/2022\n\nDuring the twelve-month period beginning 1 February 2021, Novo Nordisk repurchased shares worth DKK 20 billion. The share repurchase programme has primarily been conducted in accordance with the safe harbour rules in the EU Market Abuse\n\n## Share price performance 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

For the next 12 months, Novo Nordisk has decided to implement a new share repurchase programme. The expected total repurchase value of B shares amounts to a cash value of up to DKK 22 billion. The total programme may be reduced in size if significant business development opportunities arise during 2022. Novo Nordisk expects to conduct the majority of the new share repurchase programme according to the safe harbour rules defined in MAR. At the Annual General Meeting in March 2022, the Board of Directors will propose a further reduction in the company's B share capital, corresponding to approximately 1.3% of the total share capital, by cancelling 30,000,000 treasury shares.\n\n## Share price development\n\nNovo Nordisk's share price increased by 72.3% during 2021 until its close on 31 December close of DKK 735.00. The total market value of Novo Nordisk's B shares, excluding treasury shares and Novo Holdings A/S shares, was DKK 1,198,745,107,140, as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## Strategic Aspirations 2025 Financial\n\n- -   Deliver solid sales and operating profit growth:\n- -   Deliver 6-10% sales growth in International Operations\n- -   Transform 70% of sales in the US (from 2015 to 2022)\n- -   Drive operational efficiencies across the value chain to enable investments in future growth assets\n- -   Deliver free cash flow to enable attractive capital allocation to shareholders",

Managing risks rigorously and systematically is key in order for us to create and protect value.\n\nWe apply a dual lensed approach to risk management. This means we identify and mitigate both operational risks that pose a threat to our short to medium-term plans, as well as strategic risks that could reduce our ability to achieve our corporate strategy over the long-term.\n\n## Addressing risks in our strategic planning:\n\nScenario and risk-thinking exercises are part of our strategic planning. They include analyses of market dynamics as well as socioeconomic and political developments that present risks or opportunities for our business. Annually, Executive Management and the Board of Directors review a strategic risk profile.\n\n## Access and affordability\n\nAccess to affordable care is a global issue as healthcare systems struggle to provide quality care at a sustainable cost, while the burden of chronic diseases keeps rising. Ensuring access and affordability is a risk and responsibility Novo Nordisk shares with all involved in healthcare. We recognize that we cannot defeat chronic diseases alone, but to mitigate the risk we can accelerate our actions to find solutions in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\n\nManagement           Consolidated statements           Additional information\n\n## Innovation and competition\n\nWe are a scientific based company whose future is based on raising the innovation bar. To remain competitive in the future and thereby mitigate the innovation risk, we invest significantly in internal and external pipeline opportunities to ensure patients receive improved treatments.\n\n## Digital disruption\n\nNew digital technologies could bring new competitors into the pharmaceutical industry. It also provides an opportunity for us to deliver more value to our stakeholders and help patients live a life free from the limitations of their disease. Digital health solutions bring new risks particularly around data regulation and privacy, as well as potential quality risks. We strive to monitor and mitigate these risks in close collaboration with relevant partners.\n\n## Production capacity and supply chain risks\n\nDemand fluctuations, resource shortages, trade disputes, quality assurance and local manufacturing requirements are all factors that can pressure global supply chains. Furthermore, expanding production capacity is complex and associated with a long lead time. Therefore, planning and management of our supply chain and production is key to mitigate this risk.\n\n## Operational risk management process:\n\nIn the short to medium-term we are also exposed to risks throughout our value chain. Some risks are inherent in the pharmaceutical industry, such as delays or failures of potential late-stage medicines in the R&D pipeline. Other risks, such as supply disruptions and competitive threats, are well-known to any manufacturing company with global production. We will never compromise on product quality, patient safety and business ethics: these are front and centre of our enterprise-\n\nwide risk management set-up. We assess risks to potential financial loss and reputational damage.\n\nExecutive Management, the Board of Directors and Audit Committee review a 'heat map' of our biggest operational risks every six months. This map is based on insights from management teams across the organisation and includes risks that could cause significant disruptions to the business over a three-year horizon. The following overview provides more details of our key risks.\n\nFor more information, see our Corporate Governance report available at www.novonordisk.com/about/corporategovernance.html\n\n## Key operational risks\n\nAn aggregated illustration of our key operational risks is outlined below with associated descriptions on the next page.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Clinical Pipeline Risks 1\n\nIT Security Risks\n\n- Product Supply, Quality and Safety Risk 2\n- Commercialisation Risks 3\n\nFinancial Risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Legal, Patents and Compliance Risks 6\n\nILLUSTRATIVE\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Section 1 Basis of preparation\n\n## 1.1 Principal accounting policies and key accounting estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\n## Measurement basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, equity investments, marketable securities a nd trade receivables in a factoring portfolio, which are measured at fair value. Except for the changes described in note 1.2, the principal accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for all the years presented. The general accounting policies are described in note 5.6.\n\n## Principal accounting policies\n\nNovo Nordisk's accounting policies are described in each of the individual notes to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting policies listed in the table below are regarded as the principal accounting policies applied by Management.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe use of reasonable estimates and judgements is an essential part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Given the uncertainties inherent in Novo Nordisk's business activities, Management must make certain estimates regarding valuation and make judgements on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, expenses and related disclosures.\n\nThe key accounting estimates identified are those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the measurement of assets and liabilities in the following reporting period. An example being the estimation of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates.\n\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. If necessary, changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. Management considers the key accounting estimates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. The actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated as more detailed information becomes available.\n\nIn addition, Management makes judgements in the process of applying the entity's accounting policies, for example the classification of a transaction as an asset acquisition or a business combination.\n\nManagement regards those listed below as the key accounting estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nPlease refer to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates and judgements as well as assumptions applied.\n\n| Principal accounting policies                    | Key accounting estimates and judgements                                                                                          | Estimation risk   |   Note |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|\n| US net sales and rebates                         | Estimate of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates                                                                 | High              |    2.1 |\n| Intangible assets from acquisition of businesses | Estimate in determining the fair value of intangible assets when acquiring assets in a business combination                      | High              |    5.3 |\n| Income taxes and deferred income taxes           | Estimate regarding deferred income tax assets and provision for uncertain tax positions                                          | Medium            |    2.6 |\n| Provisions and contingent liabilities            | Estimate of ongoing legal disputes, litigation and investigations                                                                | Medium            |    3.4 |\n| Intangible assets                                | Estimate regarding impairment of assets and judgement of whether a transaction is an asset acquisition or a business combination | Low               |    3.1 |\n| Inventories                                      | Estimate of indirect production costs capitalised and inventory write-down                                                       | Low               |    3.2 |\n\n## Applying materiality\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are a result of processing large numbers of transactions and aggregating those transactions into classes according to their nature or function. The transactions are presented in classes of similar items in the consolidated financial statements. If a line item is not individually material, it is aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial statements or in the notes.\n\nManagement provides specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is not applicable or is considered immaterial to the decisionmaking of the primary users of these financial statements.\n\n## 1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\n## Adoption of new or amended IFRSs\n\nManagement has assessed the impact of new or amended and revised accounting standards and interpretations (IFRSs) issued by the IASB and IFRSs endorsed by the European Union effective on or after 1 January 2021. It is assessed that application of amendments effective from 1 January 2021 has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for 2021. Furthermore, Management does not anticipate any significant impact on future periods from the adoption of these amendments.",

As such, rebates amount to 75% of gross sales in the US (74% in 2020 and 71% in 2019).\n\nProvisions for sales rebates include US Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid, and other US rebate types, as well as rebates in a number of European countries and Canada.\n\n## Pricing mechanisms in the US market\n\nIn the US, sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare insurance programmes, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and managed healthcare plans. Key customers in the US include private payers, PBMs and government payers. PBMs and managed healthcare plans play a role in negotiating price concessions with drug manufacturers for both the commercial and government channels, and determine which drugs are covered on their formularies (or 'preferred drug lists').\n\n## US Managed Care and Medicare\n\nFor Managed Care and Medicare, rebates are offered to a number of PBMs and managed healthcare plans. These rebate programmes allow the customer to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to formulary status or pre-established market share thresholds. Rebates are estimated according to the specific terms in each agreement, historical experience, anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market share information. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Managed Care and Medicare rebates are generally settled around 100 days from the transaction date.\n\n## US wholesaler charge-backs\n\nWholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between Novo Nordisk and indirect customers in the US whereby products are sold at contract prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. Since January 2021, Novo Nordisk has changed its policy in the US related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby Novo Nordisk no longer provides 340B statutory discounts to certain pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Chargebacks are  estimated using a combination of factors such as historical experience, current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms and the value of claims received but not yet processed. Wholesaler charge-backs are generally settled within 30 days after receipt of claim. Please refer to note 3.4 Provisions and contingent liabilities for a more elaborate description of the ongoing litigation on the 340B Drug Pricing Program.\n\n## US Medicaid rebates\n\nMedicaid is a government insurance programme. Medicaid rebates have been estimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population growth, price changes, and the impact of contracting strategies. The calculation also involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are\n\nsubject to changes in interpretative guidance from government authorities. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Medicaid rebates are generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date.\n\n## Other US and non-US discounts and sales returns\n\nOther discounts are provided to distributors, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, etc. They are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash discounts. Discounts are calculated based on historical data and recorded as a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded. Sales returns relate to damaged or expired products.\n\n## Other net sales disclosures\n\nIn 2021, Novo Nordisk had three major wholesalers distributing products in the US, representing 18%, 13% and 13% respectively of total net sales (19%, 13% and 12% in 2020 and 19%, 14% and 12% in 2019). Sales to these three wholesalers are within both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm.\n\nNet sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts containing fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater than 12 months, are expected to be DKK 1,012 million within 12 months (DKK 431 million in 2020) and DKK 962 million thereafter (DKK 216 million in 2020).\n\nNovo Nordisk's sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. Refer to note 4.3 for development in key exchange rates.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is recognised when Novo Nordisk has transferred control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that Novo Nordisk will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for transferring the products. Control of the products is transferred at a single point in time, typically on delivery. The amount of sales to be recognised is based on the consideration Novo Nordisk expects to receive in exchange for its goods. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records estimates for a variety of sales deductions, including product returns as well as rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance companies, managed healthcare organisations and retail customers. Sales deductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable consideration). Where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, Novo Nordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.\n\nIn some markets, Novo Nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis.

Where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis, without sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is recorded based on estimated demand and acceptance rates for wellestablished products with similar market characteristics. If similar market characteristics do not exist, revenue is recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nUnsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain (note 3.4).\n\nWhere absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Wholesaler charge-backs that are absolute are netted against trade receivable balances.\n\nThe impact of foreign currency hedging is recognised in the income statement in financial items. Please refer to notes 4.3, 4.4 and 4.10 for more details on hedging.\n\n## Key accounting estimates of sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates\n\nSales deductions are estimated and provided for at the time the related sales are recorded. These estimates of unsettled rebate, discount and product return obligations require use of significant judgement, as not all conditions are known at the time of sale, for example total sales volume to a given customer. The estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual obligations and historical experience. Provisions are calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales for each product as defined by the contracts with the various customer groups. Provisions for sales rebates are adjusted to actual amounts as rebates, discounts and returns are processed.\n\nRevenue can only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the recognised revenue will not occur. In determining the amount of revenue to recognise, Management has considered, among other factors, whether the consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside Novo Nordisk's influence, as well as the extent of predictability and historical experience with similar transactions.\n\nNovo Nordisk considers the provisions established for sales rebates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. However, the actual amount of rebates and discounts may differ from the amounts estimated by Management as more detailed information becomes available.\n\n## 2.2 Segment information\n\n## Business segments - Key figures\n\n|                                                            | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Biopharm   | Biopharm   | Biopharm   | Total    | Total    | Total    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| DKK million                                                | 2021                        | 2020                        | 2019                        | 2021       | 2020       | 2019       | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     |\n| Total net sales                                            | 121,597                     | 108,020                     | 102,840                     | 19,203     | 18,926     | 19,181     | 140,800  | 126,946  | 122,021  |\n| Cost of goods sold                                         | (19,363)                    | (17,715)                    | (16,309)                    | (4,295)    | (3,217)    | (3,779)    | (23,658) | (20,932) | (20,088) |\n| Sales and distribution costs                               | (33,791)                    | (29,903)                    | (28,729)                    | (3,217)    | (3,025)    | (3,094)    | (37,008) | (32,928) | (31,823) |\n| Research and development costs                             | (15,600)                    | (13,535)                    | (12,128)                    | (2,172)    | (1,927)    | (2,092)    | (17,772) | (15,462) | (14,220) |\n| Administrative costs                                       | (3,504)                     | (3,387)                     | (3,346)                     | (546)      | (571)      | (661)      | (4,050)  | (3,958)  | (4,007)  |\n| Other operating income and  expenses                       | 199                         | 264                         | 309                         | 133        | 196        | 291        | 332      | 460      | 600      |\n| Operating profit                                           | 49,538                      | 43,744                      | 42,637                      | 9,106      | 10,382     | 9,846      | 58,644   | 54,126   | 52,483   |\n| Operating margin                                           | 40.7%                       | 40.5%                       | 41.5%                       | 47.4%      | 54.9%      | 51.3%      | 41.7%    | 42.6%    | 43.0%    |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and  impairment losses expensed | (4,895)                     | (4,624)                     | (3,916)                     | (1,130)    | (1,129)    | (1,745)    | (6,025)  | (5,753)  | (5,661)  |\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in two business segments based on therapies: Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm, representing the entirety of the Group's operations.\n\nThe segments include research, development, manufacturing and marketing of products within the following areas:\n\n- -  Diabetes and Obesity care: insulin, GLP-1 and related delivery systems, oral antidiabetic products (OAD), obesity and other serious chronic diseases\n- -  Biopharm: Rare blood disorders, rare endocrine disorders and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nSegment performance is evaluated on the basis of operating profit, consistent with the consolidated financial statements. Financial income and expenses and income taxes are managed at Group level and are not allocated to business segments. There are no sales or other transactions between the business segments. Costs have been split between business segments according to a specific allocation. In addition, a small number of corporate overhead costs are allocated systematically between the segments. Other operating income and expenses have been allocated to the two segments based on the same principle.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Executive Management and the Board of Directors.\n\nWe consider Executive Management to be the operating decision-making body, as all significant decisions regarding business development and direction are taken in this forum.\n\n## Geographical areas\n\nSales to external customers attributed to the US are collectively the most material to the Group. The US and Mainland China are the only territories where sales contribute 10% or more of total net sales.\n\nIn 2021, Novo Nordisk operated in two main commercial units:\n\n- - International Operations\n- - EMEA: Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n- - China: Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n- - Rest of World: All other countries except for North America.\n- - North America Operations (the US and Canada).\n\nRefer to note 5.7 for an overview of companies in the Novo Nordisk Group based on geographical areas.\n\nThe country of domicile is Denmark, which is part of EMEA. Denmark is immaterial to Novo Nordisk's activities in terms of sales as 99.8% of total sales are realised outside Denmark. Sales are attributed to geographical areas according to the location of the customer.",

These methods have played a key role in the development of the production technology used to manufacture insulin, GLP-1, recombinant blood-clotting factors and human growth hormone. Research activities further focus on new technology platforms including stem cells, gene therapy and developing RNAi therapies.\n\nResearch and development activities are carried out by Novo Nordisk's research and development centres, mainly in Denmark, the US, the UK and China. Clinical trials are carried out all over the world. Novo Nordisk also enters into partnerships and licence agreements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNovo Nordisk expenses all research costs. In line with industry practice, internal and subcontracted development costs are also expensed as they are incurred, due to significant regulatory uncertainties and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products. This means that they do not qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets until marketing approval by a regulatory authority is obtained or considered highly probable. Costs for post-approval activities that are required by authorities as a condition for obtaining regulatory approval are recognised as research and development costs.\n\nResearch and development costs primarily comprise employee costs, and internal and external costs related to execution of studies, including manufacturing costs and facility costs of the research centres. The costs also comprise amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses related to software and property, plant and equipment used in the research and development activities. Impairment losses recognised on intangible assets related to research and development projects are presented in research and development costs.\n\nCertain research and development activities are recognised outside research and development costs:\n\n- - Royalty expenses paid to partners after regulatory approval are expensed as cost of goods sold.\n- - Royalty income received from partners is recognised as part of other operating income and expenses.\n- - Contractual research and development obligations to be paid in the future are disclosed separately as commitments in note 5.2.\n\n## 2.4 Employee costs\n\n| DKK million                                                                          | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Wages and salaries                                                                   | 28,939  | 26,778  | 25,335  |\n| Share-based payment costs   (note 5.1)                                               | 1,040   | 823     | 363     |\n| Pensions - defined contribution  plans                                               | 2,022   | 1,961   | 1,910   |\n| Pensions - defined benefit plans  (note N/A)                                         | 139     | 138     | 151     |\n| Other social security contributions                                                  | 2,203   | 1,862   | 1,963   |\n| Other employee costs                                                                 | 2,189   | 2,044   | 2,203   |\n| Total employee costs for the year                                                    | 36,532  | 33,606  | 31,925  |\n| Employee costs capitalised as  intangible assets and property,   plant and equipment | (1,240) | (1,279) | (1,314) |\n| Change in employee costs  capitalised as inventories                                 | (56)    | (60)    | (139)   |\n| Total employee costs  in the income statement                                        | 35,236  | 32,267  | 30,472  |\n| Included in the income statement:                                                    |         |         |         |\n| Cost of goods sold                                                                   | 9,611   | 8,896   | 8,134   |\n| Sales and distribution costs                                                         | 15,003  | 14,146  | 13,463  |\n| Research and development costs                                                       | 7,328   | 6,269   | 5,968   |\n| Administrative costs                                                                 | 3,098   | 2,848   | 2,679   |\n| Other operating income and  expenses                                                 | 196     | 108     | 228     |\n| Total employee costs in the  income statement                                        | 35,236  | 32,267  | 30,472  |\n| Number of employees                                                                  | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n| Average number of   full-time employees                                              | 46,171  | 43,759  | 42,218  |\n| Year-end number of                                                                   | 47,792  | 44,723  | 42,703  |\n| full-time employees                                                                  |         |         |         |\n| Employees (total)                                                                    | 48,478  | 45,323  | 43,258  |",

Total remuneration for registered members of Executive Management amounts to DKK 0 million (DKK 141 million in 2020 and DKK 135 million in 2019). All members of the Board of Directors are registered.\n\nWages, salaries, social security contributions, annual leave and sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of Novo Nordisk. Where Novo Nordisk provides long-term employee benefits, the costs are accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.\n\n## 2.5 Other operating income and expenses\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOther operating income and expenses, comprises licence income and income of a secondary nature in relation to the main activities of Novo Nordisk. Licence income from royalties on net sales is recognised as the underlying customers' sale occurs and from sales milestones once the contingent sale milestone is achieved in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement.\n\nOperating profit from the wholly owned subsidiary NNE A/S, not related to Novo Nordisk's main activities, is recognised as other operating income and expenses. Other operating income and expenses, also includes income from the sale of intellectual property rights as well as transaction costs incurred in connection with acquisition of businesses.\n\n## 2.6 Income taxes and deferred income taxes\n\n## Income taxes expensed\n\n| DKK million                                                          | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Current tax on profit for the year                                   | 13,871  | 11,557  | 11,275  |\n| Deferred tax on profit for the year                                  | (1,528) | 1,105   | (1,559) |\n| Tax on profit for the year                                           | 12,343  | 12,662  | 9,716   |\n| Current tax adjustments recognised  for prior years                  | (603)   | (563)   | (191)   |\n| Deferred tax adjustments  recognised for prior years                 | (417)   | (1,107) | 77      |\n| Income taxes in the  income statement                                | 11,323  | 10,992  | 9,602   |\n| Tax on other comprehensive   income for the year,   (income)/expense | (1,005) | 577     | 231     |\n\n## Computation of effective tax rate\n\n| DKK million                                                                          | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Statutory corporate income tax  rate in Denmark                                      | 22.0%  | 22.0%  | 22.0%  |\n| Deviation in foreign subsidiaries'  tax rates compared to the Danish  tax rate (net) | (1.5%) | (2.5%) | (2.1%) |\n| Non-taxable income less non-tax- deductible expenses (net)                           | (0.3%) | (0.2%) | 0.1%   |\n| Other adjustments (net)                                                              | (1.0%) | 1.4%   | (0.2%) |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                   | 19.2%  | 20.7%  | 19.8%  |\n\n## Income taxes paid\n\n| DKK million                                           | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income taxes paid in Denmark for  current year        | 9,703  | 4,262  | 7,774  |\n| Income taxes paid outside  Denmark for current year   | 3,439  | 4,508  | 2,258  |\n| Income taxes paid/repayments  relating to prior years | 1,296  | 1,336  | 904    |\n| Income taxes paid                                     | 14,438 | 10,106 | 10,936 |\n\nThe deviation in foreign subsidiaries' tax rates from the Danish tax rate is mainly driven by Swiss business activities as well as adjustments to deferred tax assets due to changes in local corporate tax rates. Other adjustments consist of tax related to acquisitions and subsequent transfers of intellectual property rights and adjustments to prior years.\n\nIn 2020, income taxes paid in Denmark and paid outside Denmark were impacted by transfers of intellectual property rights related to acquisitions. In 2021, the impact from acquisitions and transfer of intellectual property rights was less significant.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. It also includes adjustments to previous years and changes in provisions for uncertain tax positions. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity or other comprehensive income. Provisions for ongoing tax disputes are included as part of deferred tax assets, tax receivables and tax payables.\n\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the accounting and tax values of the individual consolidated companies and from realisable tax loss carry-forwards. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The tax value of tax loss carry-forwards is included in deferred tax assets to the extent that these are expected to be utilised in future taxable income. The deferred income taxes are measured according to current tax rules and at the tax rates assumed in the year in which the assets are expected to be utilised.\n\nIn general, the Danish tax rules related to dividends from group companies provide exemption from tax for most repatriated profits. A provision for withholding tax is only recognised if a concrete distribution of dividends is planned. The unrecognised potential withholding tax amounts to DKK 444 million (DKK 337 million in 2020).\n\nThe value of future tax deductions in relation to share programmes is recognised as a deferred tax asset until the shares are paid out to the employees. Any estimated excess tax deduction compared to the costs realised in the income statement is charged to equity.",

        "page_content": "## Key accounting estimate regarding deferred income tax assets and provisions for uncertain tax positions\n\nManagement has considered future taxable income and has estimated the amount of deferred income tax assets that should be recognised. The estimate is based on an assessment of whether sufficient taxable income will be available in the future, against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. The total tax value of unrecognised tax loss carry-forwards amounts to DKK 166 million in 2021 (DKK 628 million in 2020).\n\nIn the course of conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur. Management has estimated the expected outcome of the disputes by using the 'most probable outcome'-method to determine the provisions for uncertain tax positions. Management considers the provisions made to be adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and depends on the result of litigation and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.\n\n## Development in deferred income tax assets and liabilities\n\n| DKK million                                       | Property,  plant and  equipment   | Intangible  assets   | Inventories   | Liabilities   | Other   | Offset within countries   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|---------------------------|---------|\n| 2021                                              |                                   |                      |               |               |         |                           |         |\n| Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 1 January   | (1,614)                           | (3,600)              | 2,556         | 4,617         | 1,404   | -

The acquisition included the clinical stage antibody PRX004. PRX004 is an antibody that uses a depleter mechanism that has the potential to improve heart failure symptoms and reverse the disease progression within the ATTR-CM diseases. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition recognised in intellectual property rights, all related to PRX004.\n\n## 2020 additions\n\nIn 2020, Novo Nordisk acquired Corvidia Therapeutics Inc., in a transaction accounted for as an asset acquisition. An addition of DKK 4,580 million was recognised in intellectual property rights for the acquisition of Ziltivekimab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against Interleukin-6 related to chronic kidney disease, which is under development.\n\nNovo Nordisk acquired Emisphere Technologies Inc. and obtained ownership of the Eligen \u00ae SNAC oral delivery technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk acquired all outstanding shares of Emisphere for USD 1,335 million. As part of the transaction, Novo Nordisk also acquired related Eligen \u00ae SNAC royalty stream obligations owed to MHR Fund Management LLC (MHR), the largest shareholder of Emisphere, for USD 450 million. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, with DKK 11,060 million recognised in intellectual property rights, of which DKK 2,467 million was related to assets under development. At 31 December 2021, the carrying amount of acquired intangible assets related to Rybelsus is DKK 7,150 million (DKK 7,716 million in 2020), which has a remaining amortisation period of 13 years.\n\n## Impairment of intangible assets\n\nIn 2021, an impairment loss of DKK 573 million (DKK 350 million in 2020) was recognised, all related to intellectual property rights. DKK 436 million (DKK 350 million in 2020) of the impairment was related to the Diabetes and Obesity care segment and DKK 137 million (none in 2020) related to Biopharm. The entire impairment loss in 2021 was recognised in research and development costs (DKK 350 million in research and development costs in 2020). The impairment was a result of Management's review of expectations related to intellectual property rights not yet in use.\n\nNo impairment related to marketable products was identified in 2021 or in 2020 .\n\nIt is assessed that the carrying amount of goodwill which arose from the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on 28 December 2021 still reflected the fair value as of 31 December 2021. An impairment test has not been performed on goodwill due to the timing of the acquisition three days before year-end, and no impairment indicators have been identified in the period from the acquisition to 31 December 2021.\n\nThe allocation of goodwill of DKK 4,346 million to cash-generating units is considered provisional due to the fact that the transaction was closed on 28 December 2021, leaving limited time for determining the cash-generating units. The allocation will be finalised within 12 months from the acquisition date.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nGoodwill on acquisition of businesses is initially measured at cost, and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIntellectual property rights acquired for research and development projects, are carried at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Upfront fees and acquisition costs are capitalised and subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event will be capitalised on the contingent event being probable of being achieved. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.\n\nAmortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. This corresponds to the legal duration or the economic useful life depending on which is shorter, and not exceeding 25 years in either case. The amortisation of intellectual property rights begins after regulatory approval has been obtained or when assets are put in use.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation. They are tested annually for impairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. The carrying amount of goodwill will within 12 months from acquisition date be allocated to cash-generating units for impairment testing purposes. The allocation is made to those cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nInternal development of software for internal use is recognised as intangible assets if the recognition criteria are met, for example a significant business system where the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable asset. Amortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 3-15 years. The amortisation begins when the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management.\n\n## Research and development projects\n\nInternal and subcontracted research costs are charged in full to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Consistent with industry practice, development costs are also expensed until regulatory approval is obtained or is probable; please refer to note 2.3.\n\nPayments to third parties under collaboration and licence agreements are assessed for the substance of their nature.

        "page_content": "subcontracted research and development work are expensed as the services are received. Payments which represent rights to the transfer of intellectual property, developed at risk by the third party, are capitalised.\n\nFor acquired research and development projects, intellectual property rights, the likelihood of obtaining future commercial sales is reflected in the cost of the asset, and thus the probability recognition criteria is always considered to be satisfied. As the cost of acquired research and development projects can often be measured reliably, these projects fulfil the capitalisation criteria as intangible assets on acquisition. Subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event (e.g. commencement of phase 3 trials) are accrued and capitalised into the cost of the intangible asset when the achievement of the event is probable. Development costs incurred subsequent to acquisition are treated consistently with internal project development costs.\n\nAssets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nFactors considered material that could trigger an impairment test include the following:\n\n- - Development of a competing drug.\n- - Changes in the legal framework covering patents, rights and licences.\n- - Advances in medicine and/or technology that affect the medical treatments.\n- - Lower-than-predicted sales.\n- - Adverse impact on reputation and/or brand names.\n- - Changes in the economic lives of similar assets.\n- - Relationship to other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment.\n- - Changes or anticipated changes in participation rates or reimbursement policies.\n\nIf the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of an impairment, any impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. Impairments on intangible assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements on intangible assets\n\nImpairment tests of intellectual property rights not yet available for use are based on Management's projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products.\n\nManagement makes judgements related to intangible assets when assessing whether a transaction is a business combination or an asset acquisition. The assessment of whether a transaction is a business combination or an asset acquisition involves the optional concentration test, which is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If met the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not met, an assessment of any acquired processes is made to determine if they are substantive. Management makes judgements when assessing whether a process is substantive. A process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to producing outputs from the transaction.\n\nJudgements are also made in evaluating whether payments under collaboration arrangements are acquisition of assets or prepayment of R&D services.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Depreciation and impairment losses\n\n| DKK million                               | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of goods sold                        | 2,836  | 2,729  | 2,656  |\n| Sales and distribution costs              | 409    | 403    | 354    |\n| Research and development costs            | 736    | 724    | 783    |\n| Administrative costs                      | 386    | 433    | 376    |\n| Other operating income and  expenses      | 19     | 18     | 23     |\n| Total depreciation and  impairment losses | 4,386  | 4,307  | 4,192  |\n| Of which related to leased assets         | 899    | 964    | 852    |\n\nCapital expenditure in the reporting period was primarily related to investments in facility upgrades and new production facilities for active pharmaceutical ingredients for diabetes, mainly the facility in Clayton, US. The facility in Clayton is intended to strengthen the Novo Nordisk supply chain. Capital expenditure also related to investments in facility upgrades of the purification plant and establishing additional API capacity, both in Kalundborg.\n\n## Leased property, plant and equipment\n\n| DKK million        | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Land and buildings | 3,340  | 2,901  |\n| Other equipment    | 499    | 479    |\n| Total              | 3,839  | 3,380  |\n\nNovo Nordisk mainly leases office buildings, warehouses, laboratories and vehicles.

In 2021, the total amount recognised in the income statement related to leases was DKK 1,303 million (DKK 1,373 million in 2020). The total cash outflow for leases amounted to DKK 1,275 million (DKK 1,367 million in 2020).\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the lease liability excludes potential lease payments of DKK 2,209 million (undiscounted) related to lease term extension rights on properties that were not considered reasonably certain to be exercised (DKK 2,363 million in 2020).

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes costs directly and indirectly attributable to the construction of the assets. Any subsequent cost is included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to Novo Nordisk, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Depreciation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (buildings: 12-50 years, plant and machinery: 5-25 years and other equipment: 3-10 years. Land is not depreciated).\n\nThe depreciation commences when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management. The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. If an asset's carrying amount is higher than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Plant and equipment with no alternative use developed as part of a research and development project are expensed. However, plant and equipment with an alternative use or used for general research and development purposes are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated useful life as research and development costs.\n\nFor contracts which are, or contain, a lease, the Group recognises a rightof-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability and reduced by any impairment losses.\n\nThe lease term determined by the Group is the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with extension/termination option if these are reasonably certain to be exercised. For contracts with a rolling term (evergreen leases), the Group estimates the leasing period to be equal to the termination period if no probable scenario exists for estimating the leasing period. If the lease liability is remeasured due to a change in future lease payments a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset, or in the income statement when the right-of-use asset has been fully depreciated. For a description of accounting policies for lease liabilities, please refer to note 4.9.\n\n## 3.2 Inventories\n\n| DKK million                                                                | 2021    | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Raw materials                                                              | 4,310   | 3,326   |\n| Work in progress                                                           | 12,285  | 12,252  |\n| Finished goods                                                             | 5,282   | 5,111   |\n| Total inventories (gross)                                                  | 21,877  | 20,689  |\n| Write-downs at year-end                                                    | (2,256) | (2,153) |\n| Total inventories (net)                                                    | 19,621  | 18,536  |\n| Indirect production costs included in work in  progress and finished goods | 8,929   | 9,703   |\n| Share of total inventories (net)                                           | 46%     | 52%     |\n| Movements in inventory write-downs:                                        |         |         |\n| Write-downs at the beginning of the year                                   | 2,153   | 1,426   |\n| Write-downs during the year                                                | 883     | 1,628   |\n| Utilisation of write-downs                                                 | (661)   | (528)   |\n| Reversal of write-downs                                                    | (119)   | (373)   |\n| Write-downs at the end of the year                                         | 2,256   | 2,153   |\n\nAll write-downs in both 2021 and 2020 relate to fully impaired inventory.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost comprises direct production costs such as raw materials, consumables and labour. Production costs for work in progress and finished goods include indirect production costs such as employee costs, depreciation, maintenance, etc. If the expected sales price less completion costs to execute sales (net realisable value) is lower than the carrying amount, a write-down is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its net realisable value.\n\nInventory manufactured prior to regulatory approval (prelaunch inventory) is capitalised but immediately written down, until there is a high probability of regulatory approval for the product. The cost is recognised in the income statement as research and development costs. Once there is a high probability of regulatory approval being obtained, the write-down is reversed, up to no more than the original cost.\n\n## Key accounting estimate of indirect production costs capitalised\n\nThe production of both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm products is highly complex from fermentation to purification and formulation, including quality control of all production processes. Furthermore, the process is very sensitive to manufacturing conditions. These factors all influence the parameters for capitalisation of indirect production costs at Novo Nordisk and the full cost of the products. Indirect production costs are initially measured using a standard cost method. This is reviewed regularly to ensure relevant measures of capacity utilisation, production lead time, cost base and other relevant factors, hence inventory is valued at actual cost.\n\nWhen calculating total inventory, Management must estimate cost of production, standard cost variances and idle capacity in determining indirect production costs for capitalisation. Changes in the parameters for calculation of indirect production costs could have an impact on the gross margin and the overall valuation of inventories. Indirect production costs account for 46% of the net inventory value, reflecting a complex production process and low direct raw material costs.",

These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account in the valuation of trade receivables.\n\nThe country risk ratings in 2021 have overall remained unchanged from 2020. However, despite the continued COVID-19 pandemic Novo Nordisk has not experienced significant increases in collectability issues on individual customers nor has it experienced significant deterioration in the ageing of receivables.\n\nPlease refer to note 4.3 for the trade receivable programmes.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for doubtful trade receivables. The split of trade receivables and allowance for trade receivables is based on the location of the customer.\n\nBefore being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. The allowance for doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount of trade receivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement under sales and distribution costs. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs.\n\nManagement makes allowance for doubtful trade receivables based on the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. The allowance is an estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. Generally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days from shipment of goods. Loss allowance is calculated using an ageing factor, geographical risk and specific customer knowledge. The allowance is based on a provision matrix on days past due and a forward looking-element relating mainly to incorporation of the Dun & Bradstreet country risk rating and an individual assessment. Please refer to note 4.3 for a general description of credit risk.",

Provisions for sales rebates are related to US Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid and other US rebate types, as well as rebates in a number of European countries and Canada.\n- 2.  Other provisions consists of various types of provision, including obligations in relation to employee benefits such as jubilee benefits, company-owned life insurance, etc.\n- 3.  For non-current liabilities, provision for sales rebates is expected to be settled after one year, provisions for product returns will be utilised in 2023 and 2024. In the case of provisions for legal disputes, the timing of settlement cannot be determined.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently involved in pending litigations, claims and investigations arising out of the normal conduct of its business. While provisions that Management deems to be reasonable and appropriate have been made for probable losses, there are uncertainties connected with these estimates.\n\n## Pending litigation against Novo Nordisk\n\nNumerous claims alleging pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, and thyroid cancer have been filed in US courts against various incretin class manufacturers, including Victoza \u00ae and Novo Nordisk. As of 31 January 2022, 369 plaintiffs have filed product liability cases against Novo Nordisk, the vast majority alleging pancreatic cancer. In March and April 2021, the Federal MDL and State JCCP courts granted defendants' motions for summary judgment on federal pre-emption and general causation grounds thereby dismissing all the pending cases against Novo Nordisk relating to Victoza \u00ae . Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal of the Federal Court ruling, and they have the right to file a similar notice of appeal of the State Court ruling. Final decisions on both appeals are not expected before the end of 2022. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuit to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nIn September 2021, Novo Nordisk announced that it has reached an agreement in principle to settle the previously disclosed securities class action litigation pending in the Federal District Court of New Jersey, US. The settlement was reached after a voluntary mediation process and resolves claims brought by plaintiffs for alleged violations of US securities laws. The settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing, or responsibility by any of the defendants and will include a full release of all defendants in connection with the allegations made in the lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Novo Nordisk has agreed to pay USD 100 million (inclusive of all plaintiffs' attorneys fees and expenses and settlement costs). The payment is covered by insurance.. The settlement is subject to a court approval process, which could take several months.\n\nIn January 2022, Novo Nordisk announced that it has settled the previously disclosed securities lawsuit filed against Novo Nordisk in Denmark by a number of institutional shareholders, which included a claim for a total amount of DKK 11,800 million. The lawsuit alleged that Novo Nordisk made misleading statements and did not make appropriate disclosures regarding its sales of insulin products in the US. The settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by Novo Nordisk and no payment will be made by Novo Nordisk to the plaintiffs.\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently defending eight lawsuits, including two plead as putative class actions, relating to the pricing of diabetes medicines. Four of these cases are pending in New Jersey federal court; three are pending in federal courts in Texas, Florida, and Mississippi and the remaining one is pending in state court in Kentucky. All pending matters also name as defendants Eli Lilly and Company and Sanofi, while certain matters also name Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and related entities. Plaintiffs generally allege that the manufacturers and PBMs colluded to artificially inflate list prices paid by consumers for diabetes products, while offering reduced prices to PBMs through rebates used to secure formulary access. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit, or cash flow.\n\nIn 2016, Novo Nordisk US received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Department of Justice ('DOJ CID') relating to potential off-label marketing of NovoSeven \u00ae (including high dose and for prophylactic use) and interactions with physicians and patients. The DOJ investigation was likely prompted by a lawsuit filed by a former Novo Nordisk US employee (the 'Relator') under seal in the Western District of Oklahoma. Relator alleges Novo Nordisk US caused the submission of false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and private insurers in California as a result of the same conduct that was the subject of the DOJ CID. As a result of these allegations, Relator (on behalf of the federal and certain state governments) seeks injunctive and monetary relief. A consolidated complaint was jointly filed by Relator and the State of Washington on 9 March 2020. The consolidated complaint was unsealed (made public) by the court on 28 May 2020. Novo Nordisk has filed two motions seeking dismissal of the complaint, both of which are currently pending and awaiting ruling from the Court. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuit to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or, cash flow.\n\nSince January 2021, Novo Nordisk has changed its policy in the US related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby Novo Nordisk no longer provides 340B statutory discounts to certain pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Novo Nordisk's contract pharmacy policy has been challenged by the US Department of Health and Human Services. On 17 May 2021, the US government issued a letter to Novo Nordisk asserting that Novo Nordisk's policy violates the 340B statute. Novo Nordisk believes its policy does not violate the 340B Drug Pricing Program requirements and has commenced litigation against the government seeking a declaration that its 340B policy is consistent with relevant US laws. On 5 November 2021, the US District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a decision on Novo Nordisk's motion for summary judgment holding that the use of contract pharmacies is consistent with the 340B statute and that manufacturers have no statutory right to impose",

        "page_content": "restrictions on the sale or distribution of 340B drugs. Novo Nordisk has appealed the  decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A decision on this appeal is not expected before the end of 2022. Depending on the outcome of these matters, there may be a significant impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, net sales and cash flow.\n\nMosaic Health Inc. and Central Virginia Health Services, Inc. (both 340B covered entities) filed a putative class action lawsuit in NY Federal Court against Novo Nordisk US, Eli Lilly, Sanofi and AstraZeneca alleging a conspiracy among the manufacturers to artificially fix prices of diabetes medications through changes to their policies relating to the distribution of 340B drugs through contract pharmacy arrangements. A motion to dismiss the lawsuit has been filed and is currently pending before the Court. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit, or cash flow.\n\n## Pending claims against Novo Nordisk and Investigations involving Novo Nordisk\n\nSeveral authorities in the US have served Novo Nordisk with Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) or subpoenas calling for the production of documents and information. Below is a list of ongoing matters:\n\n- -   Washington Attorney General's Office CID (March 2017), relating to, among other things, pricing, and trade practices for insulin products, including Levemir \u00ae , NovoLog \u00ae , and Novolin \u00ae , from 1 January 2005 through the present date.\n- -   New Mexico Attorney General's Office CID (April 2017), relating to, among other things, trade practice and pricing of insulin products, namely NovoLog \u00ae and Novolin \u00ae from 1 January 2012 through the present date.\n- -   New York State Attorney General's Office Subpoena (July 2019), relating to, among other things, pricing, and trade practices for insulin products, from 1 July 2013 through the present.\n- -   Colorado Attorney General's Office CID (December2019), relating to, among other things, pricing, and trade practices for insulin products, for the period from 1 January 2010 to present.\n- -   Vermont Attorney General's Office Subpoena (December 2020), related to, among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products sold by Novo Nordisk during the period 1 January 2011 through the present date.\n- -   US Department of Justice (December 2021), relating to the financial relationships with healthcare professional and prescriptions for Ozempic \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae during the period of 1 January 2016 to present.\n\nIn all matters Novo Nordisk is cooperating with the authorities in question. Novo Nordisk does not expect the above investigations to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit, or cash flow.\n\nNovo Nordisk is one of several pharmaceutical companies that received requests for information involving pricing practices for its diabetes products from several committees of the Unites States House of Representatives and/or United States Senate. Novo Nordisk has responded to the various committees in response to their requests. Novo Nordisk does not expect the inquiries to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit, or cash flow.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nIn addition to the above, the Novo Nordisk Group is engaged in certain litigation proceedings and various ongoing audits and investigations. In the opinion of Management, neither settlement or continuation of such proceedings, nor such pending audits and investigations, are expected to have a material effect on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit, or cash flow.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, Managed Care and other customers are recorded at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. Provisions are calculated based on historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements. Unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain. Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Please refer to note 2.1 for further information on sales rebates and provisions.\n\nProvisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, Novo Nordisk arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation of the most likely outcome. Disputes for which no reliable estimate can be made are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of the anticipated expenditure for settlement. This is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision for interest is recognised as a financial expense.\n\nNovo Nordisk issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal business. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of expected future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for estimated product returns is recorded. The provision is measured at gross sales value.\n\n## Key accounting estimates regarding ongoing legal disputes, litigation and investigations\n\nProvisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provisions linked to Provisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provisions linked to ongoing legal disputes. Management makes estimates regarding provisions and contingencies, including the probability of pending and potential future litigation outcomes. These are by nature dependent on inherently uncertain future events. When determining likely outcomes of litigation, etc., Management considers the input of external counsels on each case, as well as known outcomes in case law.\n\nAlthough Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings are adequate based on currently available information, there can be no assurance that there will not be any changes in facts or matters, or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material.\n\n## 3.5 Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities primarily comprises employee cost payables, payables related to non-current assets, sales rebates as well as deferred revenue.",

In addition, a limited part is used to finance Novo Nordisk's long-term share-based incentive programme (restricted stock units) and restricted stock units to employees. Treasury shares are deducted from the share capital on cancellation at their nominal value of DKK 0.2 per share. Differences between this amount and the amount paid to acquire or\n\nreceived for disposing of treasury shares are deducted directly in equity. The purchase of treasury shares during the year relates to the remaining part of the 2020 share repurchase programme, totalling DKK 1 billion and the DKK 20 billion Novo Nordisk B share repurchase programme for 2021, of which DKK 1.6 billion was outstanding at year-end. The programme ended on 1 February 2022.

The overall objectives and policies for the company's financial risk management are outlined in an internal Treasury Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The Treasury Policy consists of the Foreign Exchange Policy, the Investment Policy, the Financing Policy and the Policy regarding Credit Risk on Financial Counterparts, and includes a description of permitted use of financial instruments and risk limits.\n\nNovo Nordisk only hedges commercial exposures and consequently does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Novo Nordisk uses a fully integrated treasury management system to manage all financial positions, and all positions are marked-to-market.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is the most important financial risk for Novo Nordisk and can have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The majority of Novo Nordisk's sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD and GBP. The foreign exchange risk is most significant in USD, CNY and JPY, while the EUR exchange rate risk is regarded as low because of Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy towards EUR.\n\nThe overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results. Novo Nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward.\n\nHedge accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. The currency hedging strategy balances risk reduction and cost of hedging by use of foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange options matching the due dates of the hedged items. Expected cash flows are continually assessed using historical inflows, budgets and monthly sales forecasts.\n\nHedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis. Management has chosen to classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items.\n\n## Key currencies figures\n\n|                                              | USD                                          | CNY                                          | JPY                                          | CAD                                          | GBP                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  |\n| 2021                                         | 629                                          | 97                                           | 5.73                                         | 502                                          | 865                                          |\n| 2020                                         | 654                                          | 95                                           | 6.13                                         | 488                                          | 839                                          |\n| 2019                                         | 667                                          | 97                                           | 6.12                                         | 503                                          | 852                                          |\n| Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) |\n| 2021                                         | 657                                          | 103                                          | 5.70                                         | 517                                          | 885                                          |\n| 2020                                         | 606                                          | 93                                           | 5.88                                         | 474                                          | 824                                          |\n| 2019                                         | 668                                          | 96                                           | 6.11                                         | 511                                          | 877                                          |\n\n## Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis\n\nAt year-end, an immediate 5% increase/decrease in the disclosed currencies versus DKK and EUR is estimated by Management to have the following impact on Novo Nordisk's operating profit for the next 12 months.\n\n## Sensitivity on operating profit of an immediate 5% increase in key currencies 1\n\n|   DKK million | USD   |   CNY |   JPY |   CAD |   GBP |\n|---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|          2022 | 2,350 |   360 |   230 |   200 |   120 |\n|          2021 | 1,900 |   460 |   200 |   140 |   110 |\n\n- 1.

In addition, Novo Nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables (less prepayments and VAT receivables) and other financial assets to be DKK 43,425 million ( DKK 29,522 million in 2020). Please refer to note 4.9 for details of the Group's total financial assets.\n\nTo manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, Novo Nordisk only enters into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with financial counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating from at least two out of the three selected ratings agencies: Standard and\n\nPoor's, Moody's and Fitch. Furthermore, maximum credit lines defined for each counterparty diversify the overall counterparty risk. The credit risk on marketable securities is low, as investments are made in highly liquid bonds with AAA credit ratings.\n\n## Credit risk exposure to non-financial counterparties\n\nOutside the US, Novo Nordisk has no significant concentration of credit risk related to trade receivables or other receivables and prepayments, as the exposure in general is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. In the US, the three major wholesalers account for a large proportion of total net sales, see note 2.1. However, US wholesaler credit ratings are monitored and part of the trade receivables are sold on full nonrecourse terms; see below for details.\n\nNovo Nordisk closely monitors the current economic conditions of countries impacted by currency fluctuations, high inflation and an unstable political climate. These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account in the valuation of trade receivables. The country risk ratings in 2021 have overall remained unchanged from 2020 to 2021. However, despite the continued COVID-19 pandemic Novo Nordisk has not experienced significant increases in collectability issues on individual customers nor has it experienced significant deterioration in the ageing of receivables.\n\n## Trade receivable programmes\n\nAt year-end, the Group had derecognised receivables without recourse having due dates after 31 December 2021 amounting to:\n\n| DKK million   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| US            | 1,313  | 1,817  | 3,672  |\n| Japan         | 2,453  | 2,351  | 2,149  |\n\nNovo Nordisk's subsidiaries in the US and Japan employ trade receivable programmes in which trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms to optimise working capital.\n\nIn addition, full non-recourse off-balance-sheet factoring arrangement programmes are occasionally applied by Novo Nordisk subsidiaries around the world, with limited impact on the Group's trade receivables.\n\nPlease refer to note 3.3 for the split of allowance for trade receivables by geographical segment.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nNovo Nordisk's exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be low due\n\nto the capital structure. Non-current debt consists of fixed rate instruments and the sensitivity towards interest rates on current debt of DKK 12,861 million (DKK 6,153 million in 2020) is countered by the interest sensitivity on cash and cash equivalents of DKK 10,719 million (DKK 12,226 million in 2020). Interest rate risk on marketable securities of DKK 6,765 million is considered low due to a low portfolio duration.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe liquidity risk is considered to be low. Novo Nordisk ensures the availability of the required liquidity through a combination of cash management, highly liquid investment portfolios and both uncommitted and committed credit facilities. Novo Nordisk uses cash pools for optimisation and centralisation of cash management.\n\nFinancial reserves comprise the sum of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year, marketable securities with original term to maturity exceeding three months and undrawn committed credit and loan facilities, with a maturity of more than 12 months, less loans and bank overdrafts classified as liabilities arising from financing activities contractually obliged for repayment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Financial reserves\n\n| DKK million                           | 2021     | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents  (note 4.6) | 10,719   | 12,226 | 15,411 |\n| Marketable securities                 | 6,765    | -      | -      |\n| Undrawn committed credit facility 1   | 11,526   | 11,531 | 11,578 |\n| Undrawn bridge facility 2             | -        | 5,577  | -      |\n| Borrowings (Note 4.5)                 | (12,861) | (576)  | (595)  |\n| Financial reserves 3                  | 16,149   | 28,758 | 26,394 |",

Average hedge rate for USD cash flow hedges is 628 at the end of 2021 and 640 at the end of 2020.\n- 2. Average hedge rate for USD fair value hedges is 628 at the end of 2021 and 634 at the end of 2020.\n\nThe fair value of cash flow hedges at year-end 2021, loss of  DKK 1,740 million, has been recognised in other comprehensive income. In addition, DKK 15 million in cash flow hedge losses on intangible asset purchases has been incurred for a total 2021 other comprehensive impact of DKK 1,755 million. The DKK 15 million deferred loss was transferred directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the intangible assets.\n\nThe financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses. There is no expected ineffectiveness at 31 December 2021, primarily because hedging instruments match currencies of hedged cash flows.\n\n## Use of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe derivative financial instruments are used to manage the exposure to foreign exchange risk. None of the derivatives are held for trading. Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast transactions, assets and liabilities.\n\nNet investments in foreign subsidiaries are currently not hedged.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOn initiation of the contract, Novo Nordisk designates each derivative financial contract that qualifies for hedge accounting as one of:\n\n- - hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge)\n- - hedges of the fair value of a forecast financial transaction (cash flow hedge).\n\nAll contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nValue adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement along with any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nValue adjustments of the effective part of cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative value adjustment of these contracts is transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement.\n\nFor cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk on highly probable nonfinancial asset purchases, the cumulative value adjustments are transferred directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the asset when recognised.\n\n## Discontinuance of cash flow hedging\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement under financial income or financial expenses.\n\nFor additional disclosures on accounting policies for financial instruments please refer to note 4.9.",

Net proceeds of the issuances have been used by Novo Nordisk for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of the bridge loan facility established in connection with Novo Nordisk's acquisition of Emisphere Technologies Inc. in 2020. The bonds are listed on Euronext Dublin.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe lease liabilities are related to IFRS 16 leases, primarily for premises and company cars and include the present value of future lease payments during the lease term. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at the commencement date, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured to reflect changes in future lease payments, e.g. changes in lease terms.\n\nIssued bonds, loans and bank overdrafts are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds received less transaction costs. In subsequent periods these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds received and the nominal value is recognised in financial income or financial expenses over the term of the loan.\n\nAs part of bridge funding the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk entered into a sale and repurchase agreement of marketable securities (REPO). On 31 December 2021, the carrying amount of the assets transferred is DKK 5,937 million, and the associated liabilities amounts to DKK 5,937 million. The repurchase is fixed, and Novo Nordisk has therefore retained full exposure from fair value changes of the marketable securities.",

There were no transfers between the 'Active market data' and 'Directly or indirectly observable market data' categories during 2021 or 2020. There are no significant intangible assets or items of property, plant and equipment measured at fair value. For a description of the credit quality of financial assets such as trade receivables, cash at bank, current debt and derivative financial instruments, please refer to notes 4.3 and 4.4.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDepending on purpose, Novo Nordisk classifies financial instruments into the following categories:\n\n- - Financial assets at fair value through the income statement\n- - Financial assets at amortised cost\n- - Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n- - Financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement\n- - Financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\nManagement determines the classification of its financial instruments on initial recognition and re-evaluates this at the end of every reporting period to the extent that such a classification is permitted or required.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through the income statement consist of equity investments, marketable securities and derivative financial instruments. These are initially recognised at fair value. Equity investments are included in other financial assets. Net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of equity instruments and marketable securities are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses. For a description of accounting policies on derivative financial instruments designated to hedge accounting, please refer to note 4.4.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are trade receivables that are held to collect or to sell in factoring agreements.\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are cash at bank and non-derivative financial assets solely with payments of principal and interest. Novo Nordisk normally 'holds-to-collect' the financial assets to attain the contractual cash flows. If collection is expected within one year (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. These are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs, except for trade receivables that are initially measured at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment.  For a description of accounting policies on trade receivables, please refer to note 3.3.\n\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date. Financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and Novo Nordisk has substantially transferred all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through the income statement consist of financial derivative instruments.\n\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost consist of borrowings (loans, issued bonds, bank overdrafts and lease liabilities), trade payables and other liabilities. These are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds received less transaction costs. The difference between the proceeds received and the nominal value is recognised in financial expenses over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. For initial recognition of lease liabilities refer to note 4.5.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is repaid, cancelled or expires.",

        "page_content": "## Fair value measurement\n\nThe fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at the end of the reporting period. Financial assets for which no active market exists are carried at fair value based on a valuation methodology.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is measured on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets. If an active market exists, the fair value is based on the most recently observed market price at the end of the reporting period. If a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, Novo Nordisk bases its valuation on the most recent transaction price. Adjustment is made for subsequent changes in market conditions, for instance by including transactions in similar financial instruments assumed to be motivated by normal business considerations.\n\nIf an active market does not exist, the fair value of standard and simple financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and unlisted bonds, is measured according to generally accepted valuation techniques. Market-based parameters are used to measure the fair value.\n\nThe fair value of trade receivables in a factoring portfolio is calculated based on the net invoice amount (invoice amount less charge-backs) less the fee payable to the factoring entity. The factoring fee is insignificant due to the short period between the time of sale to the factoring entity and the invoice due date and the rate applicable. Inputs into the estimate of US wholesaler charge-backs are described in note 2.1.\n\nThe marketable securities are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently changes to the carrying amount are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## 4.10 Financial income and expenses\n\n## Financial income\n\n| DKK million                                  | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Financial income                             |        |        |        |\n| Interest income 1                            | 231    | 337    | 65     |\n| Foreign exchange gain (net)                  | -      | 1,142  | -      |\n| Financial gain from forward  contracts (net) | 2,316  | -      | -      |\n| Capital gain on investments, etc.            | 340    | -      | -      |\n| Result of associated companies               | -      | 149    | -      |\n| Total financial income                       | 2,887  | 1,628  | 65     |\n| Financial expenses                           |        |        |        |\n| Interest expenses 1                          | 289    | 390    | 220    |\n| Foreign exchange loss (net)                  | 1,972  | -      | 539    |\n| Financial loss from forward  contracts (net) | -      | 1,889  | 2,673  |\n| Capital loss on investments, etc.            | -      | 195    | 145    |\n| Capital loss on marketable  securities       | 44     | -      | -      |\n| Result of associated companies               | 24     | -      | 137    |\n| Other financial expenses                     | 122    | 150    | 281    |\n| Total financial expenses                     | 2,451  | 2,624  | 3,995  |\n\n- 1.

A restricted stock unit gives the holder the right to receive one Novo Nordisk B share free of charge in February 2023, subject to continued employment. The cost of the DKK 660 million programme is amortised over the vesting period.\n\n## Long-term share-based incentive programme\n\n## Management Board\n\nOn 1 February 2022, the Board of Directors approved an interim allocation of 0.5 million Novo Nordisk B shares to the members of the Management Board for the 2021 financial year. The number of shares is periodically estimated based on long-term incentive performance. The final number of shares allocated for the 2021 programme is decided at the end of the performance period in 2023. The value at launch of the programme (adjusted for expected dividends) was DKK 223 million. The cost of the 2021 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2021-2023 at an annual amount of DKK 74 million. The maximum share allocation cannot exceed 26 months' base salary for the CEO, 19.5 months' base salary for executive vice presidents and up to 15.6 months' base salary for senior vice presidents. Financial targets are set by the Board for a three-year period, while every year the Board sets the non-financial targets, the first time in February 2021 for the year 2021.\n\nThe grant date of the programme was February 2021, and the share price used for the determining the grant date fair value of the award was the average share price (DKK 450) for Novo Nordisk B shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the period 3-17 February 2021, adjusted for the expected dividend. Based on the split of participants when the share allocation was decided, 45% of the allocated shares will be allocated to members of Executive Management and 55% to other members of the Management Board.\n\nThe shares allocated for 2018 were released to the individual participants subsequent to approval of the 2021 Annual Report by the Board of Directors and after the announcement of the 2021 full-year financial results on 2 February 2022. The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the programme of DKK 115 million, expensed over the vesting period of 2018-2021. The number of shares to be transferred (0.5 million shares) is higher than the original number of shares allocated, as the average sales growth in the threeyear vesting period was above the maximum performance target set by the Board and consequently, the number of shares increased by 30%.\n\nAll restricted stock units and shares allocated to Management are hedged by treasury shares.\n\n## Management group below the Management Board\n\nThe management group below the Management Board has a share-based incentive programme with similar performance criteria. For 2021, a total of 1.6 million shares have currently been allocated to this group, corresponding to a value at launch of the programme (adjusted for expected dividends) of DKK 649 million. The number of shares is periodically estimated based on long-term incentive performance. The final number of shares allocated for the 2021 programme is decided at the end of the performance period in 2023. The cost of the 2021 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2021-2023 at an annual amount of DKK 216 million. Financial target are set by the Board  for a three-year period, while every year the Board sets the non-financial targets, the first time in February 2021 for the year 2021.\n\nThe shares allocated for 2018 were released to the individual participants subsequent to approval of the 2021 Annual Report by the Board of Directors and after the announcement of the 2021 full-year financial results on 2 February 2022. The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the programme of DKK 312 million amortised over the period 2018-2021. The number of shares to be transferred (1.2 million shares) is higher than the original number of shares allocated, as the average sales growth in the three-year vesting period was above the maximum performance target set by the Board and consequently the number of shares increased by 30%.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nNovo Nordisk operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares is recognised as an expense and allocated over the vesting period.\n\nThe total amount to be expensed over the performance and vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is fixed at the grant date, and adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, Novo Nordisk revises its estimates of the number of shares expected to vest. Novo Nordisk recognises the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, in the income statement and in a corresponding adjustment to equity (change in proceeds) over the remaining vesting period. Adjustments relating to prior years are included in the income statement in the year of adjustment.",

Predominantly relates to estimated variable property taxes, leases committed but not yet commenced and low value assets.\n- 2. Potential milestone payments are associated with uncertainty as they are linked to successful achievements in research activities.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nResearch and development obligations include contingent payments related to achieving development milestones. Such amounts entail uncertainties in relation to the period in which payments are due because a proportion of the obligations are dependent on milestone achievements. Exercise fees and subsequent milestone payments under in-licensing option agreements are excluded, as Novo Nordisk is not contractually obligated to make such payments. Commercial product launch milestones include contingent payments solely related to achievement of a commercial product launch following regulatory approval.\n\nCommercial milestones, royalties and other payments based on a percentage of sales generated from sale of goods following marketing approval are excluded from the contractual commitments analysis because of their contingent nature, related to future sales.\n\nThe purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase agreements regarding medical equipment and consumer goods. Novo Nordisk expects to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flow from operations.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in 2020, a donation to the World Diabetes Foundation (WDF) was approved. For the years 2020-2024, the donation is calculated as 0.085% of Novo Nordisk's total Diabetes care net sales. The annual donation cannot exceed DKK 93 million in 2022, DKK 94 million in 2023 and DKK 95 million in 2024, or 15% of the taxable income of Novo Nordisk A/S in the financial year in question, whichever is the lowest.\n\n## Other guarantees\n\nOther guarantees amount to DKK 1,251 million (DKK 1,117 million in 2020). Other guarantees primarily relate to performance guarantees issued by Novo Nordisk.\n\n## 5.3 Acquisition of businesses\n\n## Business combinations in 2021\n\nOn 28 December 2021, Novo Nordisk acquired all outstanding shares of the publicly held US company Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. via a cash tender offer. Before the acquisition, Novo Nordisk held 2.9% of the shares in Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at a fair value of DKK 573 million.\n\n## About Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nDicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercialising medicines that are designed to leverage RNAi to silence selectively genes that cause or contribute to diseases. Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has established collaborative relationships with some of the leading pharmaceutical companies and has together with the collaborative partners more than 20 active discovery, preclinical or clinical programmes. Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. employs around 320 people.\n\n## Strategic rationale\n\nThe acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s RNAi platform is a strategic addition to Novo Nordisk's existing research technology platforms and support the strategy of using a broad range of technology platforms applicable across all Novo Nordisk's therapeutic focus areas. In 2019, Novo Nordisk entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to discover and develop RNAi therapies using Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s proprietary RNAi platform technology.\n\n## Details of the acquisition\n\nThe total purchase price amounts to DKK 22,034 million, which has been settled by the fair value of existing shareholdings of DKK 573 million, settlement of a pre-existing relationship of DKK 145 million and a cash consideration of DKK 21,316 million. The settlement of a pre-existing relationship relates to the existing research collaboration and license agreement, according to which Novo Nordisk has paid upfront for research services that on the date of acquisition had a value of DKK 145 million.\n\nFurthermore, under the existing research collaboration and license agreement, Novo Nordisk has prior to the acquisition acquired rights to license from Dicerna Pharmaceutical Inc. with a carrying value of  DKK 863 million. As part of the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceutical Inc., Novo Nordisk has acquired the underlying intellectual property rights that replace the previously acquired rights to license. The additional value of the underlying property rights of DKK 2,454 million over the carrying value of previously acquired rights to license, is included in intellectual property rights acquired in the business combination and is calculated as the present value of future payment avoided by acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceutical Inc. No material gain or loss has been recognised as part of settling the pre-existing arrangement.",

        "page_content": "The purchase price allocation for the acquisition is considered provisional due to the fact that the transaction was closed on 28 December 2021, leaving limited time to identify and determine fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Adjustments may be applied to the purchase price allocation for a period of up to 12 months from the acquisition date.\n\nThe provisional fair value of recognised assets and liabilities is as follows:\n\n| DKK million                             | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|\n| Intellectual property rights            | 18,687  |\n| Other intangible assets                 | 24      |\n| Financial assets                        | 31      |\n| Cash                                    | 3,033   |\n| Deferred tax assets/liabilities, net    | (3,480) |\n| Other net assets                        | (607)   |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired        | 17,688  |\n| Goodwill                                | 4,346   |\n| Purchase price                          | 22,034  |\n| Settlement of pre-existing relationship | (145)   |\n| Fair value of existing shareholdings    | (573)   |\n| Consideration transferred               | 21,316  |\n| Cash acquired                           | (3,033) |\n| Cash used for acquisition of businesses | 18,283  |\n\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the highly-skilled workforce and expected synergies generated from Novo Nordisk's know-how and commercialisation abilities within protein and peptide based medicines and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s know-how within RNAi technology. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nTransaction costs of DKK 124 million are included in other operating income and expenses in the income statement.\n\n## Business combinations in 2020\n\nNo business combinations were completed in 2020.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations.\n\nThe purchase price for a business comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred to the former owners including warrant holders of the acquired business and the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Any amount of the purchase price which effectively comprises a settlement of a pre-existing relationship is not part of the exchange for the acquiree and is therefore not included in the consideration for the purpose of applying the acquisition method. Settlements of pre-existing relationships are accounted for as separate transactions in accordance with the relevant IFRS.\n\nIdentifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition by applying relevant valuation methods. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nGoodwill is recognised at the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\n## Key accounting estimate in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination\n\nThe application of the acquisition method involves the use of significant estimates as the identifiable net assets of the acquiree are recognised at their fair value for which observable market prices are typically not available. This is particularly relevant for intangible assets which require use of valuation techniques typically based on estimates of present value of future uncertain cash flows.\n\nThe valuation of intellectual property rights identified in the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is mainly based on Relief From Royalty models, where Management has estimated the net present value of royalties and milestone payments, if the existing research collaboration and license agreement had been extended in time and scope to cover all of the proprietary RNAi technology. Further, Pipeline assets and research collaboration and license agreements with other parties than Novo Nordisk are valued based on estimated net present value of future cash flows.\n\n## 5.4 Related party transactions\n\n## Material transactions with related parties\n\n| DKK million                            | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Novo Holdings A/S                      |        |        |        |\n| Purchase of Novo Nordisk B shares      | 6,695  | 5,963  | 4,894  |\n| Dividend payment to Novo  Holdings A/S | 6,144  | 5,767  | 5,580  |\n| NNIT Group                             |        |        |        |\n| Services provided by NNIT              | 593    | 775    | 941    |\n| Dividend payment from NNIT             | (4)    | (18)   | (20)   |\n| Novozymes Group                        |        |        |        |\n| Services provided by Novo Nordisk      | (116)  | (113)  | (132)  |\n| Services provided by Novozymes         | 78     | 72     | 103    |\n| CS Solar Fund XIV                      |        |        |        |\n| Purchase of shares by Novo  Nordisk    | -      | -      | 97     |\n| Liability for capital commitment 1     | -      | -      | 389    |\n| Distribution by CS Solar Fund XIV      | -      | -      | (385)  |\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S is controlled by Novo Holdings A/S (incorporated in Denmark), which owns 28.1% of the share capital in Novo Nordisk A/S, representing 76.7% of the total number of votes.

It is defined as sales/operating profit for the period measured at the average exchange rates for the same period of the prior year compared with net sales/operating profit for the same period of the prior year. Price adjustments within hyperinflation countries as defined in IAS 29 'Financial reporting in hyperinflation economies' are excluded from the calculation to avoid growth in constant exchange rates being artificially inflated. Growth in constant exchange rates is considered to be relevant information for investors in order to understand the underlying development in sales and operating profit by adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations.\n\n## Sales in constant exchange rates\n\n| DKK million                                       | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net sales  IFRS                                   | 140,800 | 126,946 | 122,021 |\n| Effect of exchange rate                           | 3,643   | 3,254   | (3,923) |\n| Sales in constant exchange rates                  | 144,443 | 130,200 | 118,098 |\n| Net sales previous year                           | 126,946 | 122,021 | 111,831 |\n| % increase/(decrease) in reported  currencies     | 10.9%   | 4.0%    | 9.1%    |\n| % increase/(decrease) in constant  exchange rates | 13.8%   | 6.7%    | 5.6%    |\n\n## Operating profit in constant exchange rates\n\n| DKK million                                       | 2021   | 2020   | 2019    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Operating profit  IFRS                            | 58,644 | 54,126 | 52,483  |\n| Effect of exchange rate                           | 2,332  | 1,930  | (2,607) |\n| Operating profit in constant  exchange rates      | 60,976 | 56,056 | 49,876  |\n| Operating profit previous year                    | 54,126 | 52,483 | 47,248  |\n| % increase/(decrease) in reported  currencies     | 8.3%   | 3.1%   | 11.1%   |\n| % increase/(decrease) in constant  exchange rates | 12.7%  | 6.8%   | 5.6%    |\n\n## Operating profit after tax to net operating assets (OPAT/NOA)\n\n'Operating profit after tax to net operating assets' is defined as 'operating profit after tax' (using the effective tax rate) as a percentage of average inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and deferred tax assets, less non-interest-bearing liabilities including provisions and deferred tax liabilities (where the average is the sum of the above assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year and at year-end divided by two).\n\nManagement believes operating profit after tax to net operating assets is a useful measure in providing investors and Management with information regarding the Group's performance. The calculation of this financial target is a widely accepted measure of earnings efficiency in relation to total capital employed.\n\nSolely for the purpose of calculating average net operating assets for 2019, year-end net operating assets for 2018 have been adjusted upwards by DKK 3,778 million to DKK 40,541 million, reflecting the recognition by Novo Nordisk of right-of-use assets of DKK 3,778 million as of 1 January 2019 in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of operating profit after tax to net operating assets with operating profit/equity in %, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure:\n\n## Operating profit/equity in %\n\n| DKK million                  | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Operating profit  IFRS       | 58,644 | 54,126 | 52,483 |\n| / Equity  IFRS               | 70,746 | 63,325 | 57,593 |\n| Operating profit/equity in % | 82.9%  | 85.5%  | 91.1%  |\n\n## Operating profit after tax to net operating assets\n\n| DKK million                                              | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Operating profit after tax                               | 47,384 | 42,922 | 42,091 |\n| / Average net operating assets                           | 68,634 | 51,824 | 42,940 |\n| Operating profit after tax to net  operating assets in % | 69.0%  | 82.8%  | 98.0%  |\n\n## OPAT/NOA numerator\n\nReconciliation of operating profit to operating profit after tax:\n\n| DKK million                                         | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Operating profit  IFRS                              | 58,644   | 54,126   | 52,483   |\n| Tax on operating profit (using  effective tax rate) | (11,260) | (11,204) | (10,392) |\n| Operating profit after tax                          | 47,384   | 42,922   | 42,091   |",

During 2020, the ceiling price was lowered from USD 4 to USD 3 which affects the comparability of 2021 and prior years.\n- 2. In 2021, the engagement survey was entirely redesigned to support Novo Nordisk's strategic goals. As a result, comparison to previous surveys is not appropriate.\n- 3. Company reputation replaces Company trust in order to capture more dimensions of how Novo Nordisk is perceived by external stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated ESG statement\n\n## Section 6 Basis of preparation\n\n## General reporting standards and principles\n\nNovo Nordisk's annual reporting complies with the Danish Financial Statements Act. Sections 99a, 99b, 99d and 107d specify the requirements to report on the management of risks related to the environment, climate, human rights, labour and social conditions, anti-corruption, gender distribution and data ethics. These requirements are addressed in the Management Review. Novo Nordisk is also inspired by the International Integrated Reporting Framework and adheres to the AA1000AP (2018), which states that reporting must provide a complete, accurate, relevant and balanced picture of the organisation's approach to and impact on stakeholders and society.\n\nAs recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Novo Nordisk is working to integrate two climate change scenarios into the risk management process to identify short-, medium- and long-term risks within the production and supply chain:\n\n- - 2\u00baC scenario, consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement Goal (Representative Concentration Pathway RCP 2.6)\n- - 4\u00baC scenario as an alternative high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5)\n\nNovo Nordisk discloses in accordance with the recommendations put forward by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). For a full breakdown of climate and water impacts, please refer to the publicly available report on Novo Nordisk CDP disclosures.\n\nNovo Nordisk applies AA1000AP (2018) as a component in creating a generally applicable approach to assessing and strengthening the credibility of the Group's public reporting of ESG information. Novo Nordisk has designed processes to ensure that the qualitative and quantitative information that documents the ESG dimensions of performance is assured, as well as the systems that underpin the data and performance. The principles outlined in AA1000AP (2018) have been applied as described below.\n\n## Inclusivity\n\nAs a pharmaceutical business with global reach, Novo Nordisk is committed to being accountable to those stakeholders who are impacted by the organisation. From the perspective of social responsibility, the key stakeholder groups are patients who rely on Novo Nordisk products, employees at Novo Nordisk and throughout the Group's value chain, business partners and local communities. Novo Nordisk maps its stakeholders and has processes in place to ensure inclusion of stakeholder concerns and expectations.\n\n## Materiality\n\nWhen assessing whether a disclosure is material to include in the consolidated ESG statement, Management considers whether the matter is of such relevance and importance that it could substantively influence the assessment by providers of financial capital of Novo Nordisk's ability to create value over the short-, medium- and long-term. This assessment builds on ongoing stakeholder engagement and trendspotting supplemented by data-driven analysis. The identified key issues are addressed by programmes or action plans with clear and measurable targets. The issues presented in the Annual Report are thus deemed to have a significant impact on the Group's Environmental, Social and Governance performance and hereby the future business performance and may support stakeholders in their decision-making.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\nThe Annual Report reflects how the company is managing operations in ways that consider and respond to stakeholder concerns and interests. The report reaches out to a wide range of stakeholders but is primarily prepared with investors in mind. To all Novo Nordisk stakeholders, the Annual Report is just one element of interaction and communication with the company.\n\n## Impact\n\nUnderstanding, measuring and communicating the positive and negative impacts on society and the environment of Novo Nordisk's activities is important and remains a priority for Novo Nordisk.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe disclosures of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions cover production sites, laboratories and offices. The disclosures of water consumption, environmental breaches and waste cover production sites.\n\nThe social and governance-related disclosures cover the Novo Nordisk Group, comprising Novo Nordisk A/S and entities controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S as applicable.\n\n## Accounting policies and changes hereto\n\nThe accounting policies set out in the notes have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated ESG statement for all the years presented unless stated otherwise below.\n\nThe existing categorisation of CO 2 emissions from operations and transportation has been supplemented with the categorisation into scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions to align with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\nGender in senior leadership positions (ratio men:women) has been added to the statement to reflect the aspirational target of 45:45 representation in senior leadership positions launched during 2021. The target of 45:45 representation leaves 10% flexibility while also allowing for non-binary gender definitions and those that may not wish to be categorised.\n\nSustainable employer score is replacing the previous disclosure of employee engagement in accordance with Novo Nordisk's aspirations of becoming a sustainable employer. The sustainable employer score is based on the new employee survey and captures a multitude of dimensions related to employee well-being.\n\nCompany reputation is replacing the previous disclosure of company trust. A new and more comprehensive approach to reputational intelligence has been launched in 2021 to cover more markets and stakeholders. These insights are summarised in the company reputation score.\n\nFinally, the categorisation of disclosures into Environment, Social and Governance as well as the sub-categorisation within each dimension has been changed for some metrics.",

The fuel is mainly from natural gas, wood, diesel oil, gas oil and light fuel oil. Energy consumption is based on meter readings and invoices.\n\nEnergy consumption in production and laboratories covers consumption of power, steam, heat and fuel. Energy consumption in office buildings outside Denmark is limited to the consumption of power.\n\nThe share of renewable power used at production sites is reported according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Scope 2 Guideline. It is calculated as the sum of power in each site or office that is derived from 100% renewable sources, either sourced or self-produced.\n\n## 7.2 Water consumption for production sites\n\nIn 2021, production sites consumed 3,488,000 cubic metres of water, an increase of 4% compared to 2020 due to a new production facility and a general increase in produced volumes.\n\nProduction sites in Brazil, China, Iran and Algeria, are located in areas subject to water stress or high seasonal variations. They consume 10% of the total water for global production. Overall, water consumption at these facilities decreased by 10% compared to 2020 due to significant watersaving projects implemented despite increased production.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWater consumption is measured based on meter readings and invoices. It includes drinking water, industrial water and steam used at production sites.\n\n## 7.3 Breaches of environmental regulatory limit values\n\nIn 2021, there were 12 breaches, a decrease from 15 breaches in 2020. The breaches were mainly related to wastewater and process waste, and all had a limited impact on the environment. All breaches were reported to the authorities.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBreaches of regulatory limit values cover all breaches reported to the environmental authorities.\n\n## 7.4 CO 2 emissions from operations and transportation\n\n## CO 2 emissions from operations and transportation\n\n| 1,000 tonnes                      |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Production                        |     39 |     37 |     86 |\n| Office buildings and laboratories |      8 |      8 |     13 |\n| Product distribution              |     71 |     61 |     80 |\n| Business flights                  |     10 |     19 |     65 |\n| Company cars                      |     46 |     45 |     62 |\n| Total CO 2  emissions             |    174 |    170 |    306 |\n\n## CO 2 emissions by Scope 1, 2 and 3\n\n| 1,000 tonnes                        |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1                             |     77 |     75 |     86 |\n| - Production                        |     29 |     28 |     21 |\n| - Office buildings and laboratories |      2 |      2 |      3 |\n| - Company cars                      |     46 |     45 |     62 |\n| Scope 2                             |     16 |     15 |     75 |\n| - Production                        |     10 |      9 |     65 |\n| - Office buildings and laboratories |      6 |      6 |     10 |\n| Scope 3 1                           |     81 |     80 |    145 |\n| - Business flights                  |     10 |     19 |     65 |\n| - Product distribution              |     71 |     61 |     80 |\n| Total CO 2  emissions               |    174 |    170 |    306 |\n\n- 1.  Scope 3 emissions are restricted to CO 2 emissions from business flights and product distribution. For a full overview of CO 2 emissions, please visit cdp.net\n\nNovo Nordisk has long-term targets of zero CO 2 emissions from operations and transportation by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2045.\n\nIn 2021, total CO 2 emissions from operations and transportation increased by 2%. The increase was primarily due to a rise in emissions from product distribution.\n\nScope 1 emissions increased by 3% due to a new production facility, increased natural gas consumption caused by a general increase in produced volumes and an increase in car fuel consumption.\n\nScope 2 emissions increased by 7% due to increased electricity and steam consumption caused by a general increase in produced volumes.\n\nScope 3 emissions increased by 1% following a 16% increase in product distribution, partially countered by a 47% decrease in emissions from business flights due to COVID-19. The increase in emissions from product distribution is primarily caused by increased use of air freight instead of sea and road freight. CO 2 reductions of 4,000 tonnes were incurred from green fuel agreements with selected transportation service providers.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEmissions are limited to CO 2 emissions from energy and do not include other greenhouse gases.",

        "page_content": "## CO 2 emissions from operations (production, office buildings and laboratories)\n\nCO 2 emissions from operations cover consumption of power, fuel, heat and steam at office buildings in Denmark, global production sites and laboratories, and consumption of power in office buildings outside Denmark. Emissions are calculated according to the GHG Protocol and based on emission factors from the previous year.\n\n## CO 2 emissions from product distribution\n\nCO 2 emissions from product distribution are calculated by external transportation suppliers as the estimated emissions from product distribution in metric tonnes. CO 2 emissions are calculated based on the worldwide distribution of semi-finished and finished products, raw materials and components by air, sea and road between production sites and from production sites to subsidiaries, direct customers and importing distributors. CO 2 emissions from product distribution from subsidiaries to pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers are not included. Due to the lack of reliable emissions data from specific freight forwarders, an estimated 3% of trucking emissions are not included in the scope.\n\n## CO 2 emissions from business flights\n\nCO 2 emissions from business flights are estimated based on mileage and emission factors for short-, medium- and long-haul flights along with passenger class obtained from travel agencies. Currently, 85% of emissions from flights are calculated based on data provided by travel agencies. The remaining 15% emissions are extrapolated based on the average CO 2 emissions per employee.\n\n## CO 2 emissions from company cars\n\nCO 2 emissions from company cars cover cars leased or owned by Novo Nordisk. Emissions are calculated by multiplying emission factors by the volumes of diesel and petrol used.\n\n## CO 2 emissions by scope 1, 2 and 3\n\nScope 1 emissions comprise direct CO 2 emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S.\n\nScope 2 emissions comprise CO 2 emissions from purchased or acquired electricity, cooling, heat and steam.\n\nScope 3 emissions only include CO 2 emissions from business flights and product distribution. Other Scope 3 categories, e.g. purchased goods and services, capital goods, waste generated in operations and employee commuting, are not included.\n\n## 7.5 Waste from production sites\n\n## Waste from production sites\n\n| 1,000 tonnes                           |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Organic residues                       |    143 |    108 |     89 |\n| Other (paper, cardboard, metals, etc.) |      8 |      8 |      8 |\n| Total recycling                        |    151 |    116 |     97 |\n| Ethanol waste                          |     13 |      9 |     13 |\n| Other (various combustible waste)      |      9 |      6 |      5 |\n| Total waste with energy recovery       |     22 |     15 |     18 |\n| Water waste                            |      5 |      5 |      5 |\n| Other                                  |      2 |      4 |      3 |\n| Total waste with no energy recovery    |      7 |      9 |      8 |\n| Total waste to landfill                |      1 |      1 |      1 |\n| Total waste                            |    181 |    141 |    124 |\n\nIn 2021, waste from production sites increased by 28% due to increased production. 96% of the total waste was either recycled, used for biogas production or incinerated at plants where energy is used for heat and power production.\n\nThe amount of waste recycled increased by 30% from 116,000 to 151,000 tonnes primarily driven by the production in Kalundborg, Denmark.\n\nThe amount of waste sent for energy recovery increased by 47% from 15,000 to 22,000 tonnes, primarily due to increased production volumes and challenges in ethanol regeneration. Less than 1% of total waste was sent to landfill.\n\nIn 2021, as in 2020, 14% of the waste was categorised as hazardous waste.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWaste is measured as the sum of all the waste disposed of at production sites based on weight receipts. Organic residues for recycling are waste from the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, where the energy is recovered in biogas plants and the digested slurry is used on local farmland as fertiliser. Ethanol is recovered in internal regeneration plants and re-used. Energy recovery is waste disposed of at waste-to-energy plants and at a biogas plant. Waste with no energy recovery covers water waste and other waste not suitable for other disposal methods, such as hazardous waste for incineration and various other types of waste.\n\n## Section 8 Social performance\n\n## 8.1 Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products\n\nThe estimated number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products increased from 32.8 million in 2020 to 34.6 million in 2021. This 5% increase was primarily driven by growth in the GLP-1 franchise which increased by 1.3 million patients followed by the new-generation insulin franchise which grew by 0.7 million patients.\n\nIn 2021, the estimated number of patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products through the Access to Insulin Commitment was 1.7 million. Novo Nordisk also sold human insulin below the ceiling price of USD 3 in countries outside the commitment, reaching an estimated additional 2.2 million patients in 2021. During 2020, the ceiling price was lowered from USD 4 to USD 3 which affects the comparability of 2021 and prior years. Comparing 2021 and 2020 using the current ceiling price of USD 3, the result is an estimated increase of 40,000 patients reached in 2021. Using the previous ceiling price of USD 4, an estimated 3.4 million patients were reached in 2021 compared to 3.2 million in 2020. In addition to offering insulin at a low price, supply chain improvements and capacity building are also important levers in ensuring access to affordable care for vulnerable patients.\n\nThrough the Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme, 31,846 children had been reached by the end of 2021, compared with 28,296 in 2020. More than half of the 3,550 newly enrolled children were reached through expansion of the programme in Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Uganda.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products, excluding devices, is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient for each product class as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products (human insulin in vials) via the Access to Insulin Commitment is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient reached via the Access to Insulin Commitment as defined by WHO.",

Actual doses are based on individual characteristics (e.g. age and weight) and pharmacokinetic considerations. Despite this uncertainty, Novo Nordisk assesses this to be the most consistent way of reporting.\n\nThe number of children reached with diabetes care treatment through the Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme is measured as the total accumulated number of children enrolled since the initiation of the partnership in 2009.\n\n## 8.2 Employees\n\n## Employees\n\n| Number                                      | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| North America Operations                    | 6,106  | 6,213  | 6,190  |\n| International Operations                    | 42,372 | 39,110 | 37,068 |\n| - EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) | 26,680 | 24,600 | 23,540 |\n| - of which in Denmark                       | 19,150 | 17,538 | 16,747 |\n| - China (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan) | 5,833  | 5,548  | 5,263  |\n| - Rest of World (all other countries)       | 9,859  | 8,962  | 8,265  |\n| Total employees                             | 48,478 | 45,323 | 43,258 |\n| Full-time employees                         | 47,792 | 44,723 | 42,703 |\n\nThe number of employees increased in most areas, with the highest growth in Product Supply Quality & IT, partially countered by North America Operations.\n\nThe employee turnover rate increased from 7.9% in 2020 to 11.0% in 2021 which is comparable to turnover rates in years prior to COVID-19.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of employees is recorded as all employees except externals, employees on unpaid leave, interns, bachelor and master thesis employees and substitutes at year-end.\n\nEmployees are attributed to geographical regions according to their primary workplace across the commercial units, research and development, production and support functions. Employees in corporate functions are included in EMEA, and employees in Global Business Services in Bangalore, India are included in Rest of World.\n\nThe rate of turnover is measured as the number of employees, excluding temporary employees, who left the Group during the financial year divided by the average number of employees, excluding temporary employees. Employees working for Group companies that have been disposed of are not counted as having left the Group.\n\n## 8.3 Sustainable employer score\n\nIn 2021 the global employee survey was entirely redesigned to support Novo Nordisk's ambition to be a Sustainable Employer, which underpins the broader Sustainable Business agenda. The new 21-item survey, Evolve, is sharply focused on the most vital elements of the Sustainable Employer ambition, provides greater differentiation of results, and is more actionable for leaders and their teams.\n\nThe inaugural Evolve survey revealed that overall engagement is high at 84% favourable, and that Novo Nordisk scores in the top decile against external organisations when it comes to providing a Purpose-driven workplace. Opportunities for improvement include greater equality of career opportunities, better work-life balance and clearer performance evaluations.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Sustainable employer score measures the average percentage of favourable answers to the 18 engagement items in the survey. Favourable answers are defined as \"Agree\" and \"Strongly agree\" to positively framed questions. The survey is distributed through an external vendor.\n\n## 8.4 Frequency of occupational accidents\n\nThe average frequency rate of occupational accidents with absence was 1.3 accidents per million working hours in 2021, which is unchanged compared to 2020. The increase of 6.5% in the number of occupational accidents with absence (99 in 2021 compared to 93 in 2020) was counter-balanced by an increase in the number of employees. In 2021, Novo Nordisk had zero (0) work-related fatalities compared to one (1) in both 2019 and 2020. Novo Nordisk works with a zero-injury mindset and has a long-term commitment to continuously improving safety performance.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe frequency of occupational accidents with absence is measured as the internally reported number of accidents per million nominal working hours. Contractors, visitors, employees on unpaid leave, interns, and bachelor and\n\nmaster thesis students are not included. An occupational accident with absence is any work-related accident causing at least one day of absence in addition to the day of the accident.\n\n## 8.5 Gender diversity\n\n## Gender in leadership positions\n\n| Ratio men:women                          | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| CEO, EVP, SVP                            | 72:28  | 76:24  | 82:18  |\n| CVP, VP                                  | 63:37  | 64:36  | 66:34  |\n| Director, Manager, Team Leader           | 57:43  | 58:42  | 59:41  |\n| Gender in leadership positions (overall) | 57:43  | 59:41  | 60:40  |\n| Gender in senior leadership positions    | 64:36  | 65:35  | 67:33  |\n| Gender in the Board of Directors         | 67:33  | 62:38  | 62:38  |\n\nThe gender diversity in leadership positions overall at Novo Nordisk meets the Danish gender diversity requirements. Gender diversity in leadership positions overall increased from 41% in 2020 to 43% in 2021. Within senior leadership positions, there was an increase from 35% in 2020 to 36% in 2021. Among employees as a whole, the gender split was 49% women and 51% men in 2021, the same as in 2020.\n\nAll management teams, from entry level upwards, are encouraged to focus on enhanced diversity, with the aim of ensuring a robust pipeline of talent for leadership positions. In 2021, a global aspirational target of achieving a balanced gender representation across all managerial levels with a minimum of 45% for both women and men in senior leadership positions by the end of 2025 was introduced. Further information about the new target is disclosed in 'Launching aspirational targets' on page 17.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, two shareholder-elected Board members were female and six were male. The 2024 target of having at least three shareholder-elected Board members of each gender was thus not yet met as a female Board member stepped down at the 2021 annual general meeting, leaving the number of female Board members at two. Diversity in the broadest sense remains a key focus area for the Board of Directors, including in Board member searches. Further information about the Board members is disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report.",

In 2020, the split was 52% on taxes borne (DKK 13,676 million) and 48% on taxes collected (DKK 12,700 million).\n\nThe overall increase in total tax contribution from 2020 to 2021 is primarily related to Corporate income taxes paid. In 2020 the calculated corporate tax payable exceeded the prepayment of corporate income taxes in Denmark. These additional corporate income taxes have been paid in 2021. Furthermore, the profit before tax has increased for 2021, also resulting in an increase in Corporate income taxes paid.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNovo Nordisk's total tax contribution is measured as the taxes borne or collected by Novo Nordisk, which have been paid in the respective year. Taxes borne are defined as taxes where Novo Nordisk carries the cost. Taxes collected are defined as taxes collected by Novo Nordisk on behalf of others, e.g. employee income taxes deducted from the employee salaries and paid on to the government.\n\n## Corporate income taxes paid\n\nCorporate income taxes paid primarily consist of corporate income taxes and withholding taxes on company dividends paid during the year.\n\n## Employment taxes\n\nEmployment taxes primarily consist of taxes collected from the employees on behalf of the government and social security costs (part of payroll taxes in some countries).\n\n## Indirect taxes\n\nIndirect taxes consist of non-refundable VAT, net VAT collections, customs duties, environmental taxes and property taxes.\n\n## Other taxes\n\nOther taxes consist of country-specific taxes not linked to one of the categories above, e.g. the US branded prescription drug (BPD) fee.\n\n## 8.7 Donations and other contributions\n\n## Donations and other contributions\n\n| DKK million                                 | 2021   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| World Diabetes Foundation (WDF)             | 92     |    138 |     86 |\n| Novo Nordisk Haemophilia  Foundation (NNHF) | -      |     20 |     19 |\n| Total donations and other  contributions    | 92     |    158 |    105 |\n\nThe WDF, an independent trust, supports sustainable partnerships and acts as a catalyst to help others do more. The amount granted to WDF has decreased from DKK 138 million in 2020 to DKK 92 million in 2021 as the donation in 2020 included a special one-off contribution of DKK 50 million. In 2021, the WDF Board of Directors approved funding to 13 partnership projects in 16 countries. See note 5.2 in the consolidated financial statements and worlddiabetesfoundation.org for additional information.\n\nThe NNHF supports programmes in low- and middle-income countries. Initiatives focus on capacity-building, diagnosis and registry, awareness and advocacy. Novo Nordisk agreed to a donation of DKK 20 million to NNHF in 2021 but due to financial considerations from NNHF the donation was not paid out. Since 2005, the NNHF has provided funding for 289 programmes in 83 countries. See nnhf.org for additional information.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDonations and other contributions by Novo Nordisk to the WDF and the NNHF are recognised as an expense when the donation or contribution is paid out or when an unconditional commitment to donate has been made.\n\n## Section 9 Governance performance\n\n## 9.1 Business ethics reviews and training\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of business ethics reviews is recorded as the number of business ethics reviews performed by Group Internal Audit in subsidiaries, production sites, vendors and headquarter areas.\n\nThe mandatory business ethics training is based on the Business Ethics Code of Conduct in the form of globally applicable e-learning and related tests released annually by the Novo Nordisk Business Ethics Compliance Office. The percentage of employees completing the training is calculated as the percentage of completion of training in both the Code of Conduct and related tests based on internal registrations.\n\n## 9.2 Supplier audits\n\n## Supplier audits\n\n| Number                      |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Responsible sourcing audits |     16 |      7 |     27 |\n| Quality audits              |    237 |    170 |    209 |\n| Total supplier audits       |    253 |    177 |    236 |\n\nThe number of audits concluded in 2021 increased by 43% compared to 2020. The increase represents an improved ability to conduct audits of suppliers although the effects of COVID-19 continue to limit travel and access to suppliers' facilities. One critical finding regarding credibility of certificate of analysis has been issued during a qualification audit in 2021. Consequently, Novo Nordisk has decided not to use the supplier in question.",

A recall can affect various countries.\n\n## 9.4 Failed inspections\n\nIn 2021, as in 2020, Novo Nordisk had no failed inspections among those resolved at year-end. However, a contract manufacturer filling syringes for Wegovy \u00ae failed an inspection causing disruption in the supply of Wegovy \u00ae . During 2021, 97 inspections of Novo Nordisk were conducted, compared with 77 in 2020. At year-end, 86 inspections were passed and 11 were unresolved, as final inspection reports had not been received or the final authority acceptance was pending, which is normal. Follow-up on unresolved inspections continues in 2022.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe number of failed inspections is measured in relation to inspections by the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Notified Body (T\u00dcV SUD) and domestic authorities for strategic manufacturing sites. Failed inspections are defined as inspections where Warning Letters or EMA non-compliance letters related to GMP inspections are received, GMP/ISO certificates for strategic sites are lost, pre-approval inspections result in a Warning Letter, study conclusions are changed due to GCP/GLP inspection issues, or marketing or import authorisations are withdrawn due to inspection issues. Strategic sites are defined as the manufacturing sites in Brazil, China, Denmark, France and the US.\n\n## 9.5 Facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way\n\nIn 2021, a total of 34 units were facilitated and more than 1,600 employees were individually interviewed. In addition, feedback on those units was collected from approximately 500 stakeholders.\n\nOverall, the 2021 process continues to show a good level of adherence to the Novo Nordisk Way. 5 units were found to be in breach of one or more of the Novo Nordisk Essentials. The Essential with the strongest performance continues to be Essential 1 (We create value by having a patient-centred business approach) and Essential 10 (We never compromise on quality and business ethics. In 2021, partly driven by the focus on strengthening the culture journey, significantly more findings were issued related to Essential 2 (We set ambitious goals and strive for excellence) and Essential 7 (We focus on personal performance and development).\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFacilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way is measured as the number of facilitations completed. It is an internal process for assessing adherence to the Novo Nordisk Way. The assessments are based on review of documentation and feedback from stakeholders followed by an on-site visit during which randomly selected employees and management are interviewed. Identified gaps and improvement opportunities related to the Novo Nordisk Way are presented to and discussed with management. The facilitators and management agree on an action plan to address those gaps and improvement opportunities.\n\n## 9.6 Company reputation\n\n## Company reputation\n\n| Scale 0-100             |   2021 | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| People with diabetes    |   77.1 | N/A    | N/A    |\n| People with obesity     |   79.4 | N/A    | N/A    |\n| General practitioners   |   81.5 | N/A    | N/A    |\n| Diabetes specialists    |   84.8 | N/A    | N/A    |\n| Informed general public |   90.3 | N/A    | N/A    |\n| Total score (average)   |   82.6 | N/A    | N/A    |\n\nCompany reputation is replacing the previous disclosure of company trust. A new and more comprehensive approach to reputational intelligence was launched in 2021 to cover more markets and stakeholders.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe reputation score is based on four factors measuring esteem, admiration, trust, and feeling of the stakeholders towards Novo Nordisk across ten key markets: USA, Canada, Brazil, China, Japan, Germany, Italy, UK, France, and Denmark. The data are collected through online surveys carried out by an external consultancy firm. Responses are aggregated to produce an overall score on a Likert scale of 1-7 which is rebased on a 0-100 scale.\n\n## 9.7 Animals purchased for research\n\n## Animals purchased\n\n| Number                       | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mice, rats and other rodents | 35,675 | 38,850 | 48,081 |\n| Pigs                         | 759    | 783    | 880    |\n| Rabbits                      | 184    | 239    | 349    |\n| Dogs                         | 114    | 91     | 157    |\n| Non-human primates           | 495    | 264    | 168    |\n| Fish                         | 10,638 | 9,804  | -      |\n| Other vertebrates            | 14     | 5      | 2      |\n| Total animals purchased      | 47,879 | 50,036 | 49,637 |\n\nThe number of animals purchased for research in 2021 decreased by 4.3% compared with 2020 due to reduced usage of mice, rats and other rodents. The overall development reflects the changes in stages of the different research projects. The reduction in the number of rodents purchased reflects Novo Nordisk's continuous focus on reducing the number of animals per research project. 75% of the animals purchased were rodents and 22% were fish.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe record of animals purchased for research comprises the number of animals purchased for all research undertaken by Novo Nordisk either in-house or by external contractors. The number of animals purchased is based on internal registration of purchased animals and yearly reports from external contractors.",

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act, and the parent financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position at 31 December 2021, and of the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January 2021 - 31 December 2021 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements under the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nFurther, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give a true and fair view of the Parent's financial position at 31 December 2021, and of the results of its operations for the financial year 1 January 2021 - 31 December 2021 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our Long-form Auditor's report issued to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements section of this auditor's report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional ethical requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\nWe were appointed auditors of Novo Nordisk A/S for the first time on 25 March 2021 for the financial year 2021.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements for the financial year 1 January 2021 - 31 December 2021.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nUS sales rebates\n\nRefer to notes 2.1 and 3.4 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the United States (US), sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare insurance programmes, namely Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and managed healthcare plans. Since January 2021, the Group no longer provides 340B statutory discounts to certain pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Revenue can only be recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur, and give rise to obligations which are provisioned and recorded as sales deduction at the time the related sales are recorded.\n\nThe provision for sales rebates and discounts amounted to DKK 50,822 million as of 31 December 2021, a significant portion of which related to the US business.\n\nThe US sales rebates, including provisions related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, involved significant measurement uncertainty as the provisions are based on legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical claims experience, payer channel mix, current contract prices, unbilled claims, claims submission time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Consequently, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nAcquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nRefer to notes 3.1 and 5.3 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group completed the acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for DKK 22,034 million on 28 December 2021.\n\nThe preliminary fair value determination of the intangible assets required Management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. Consequently, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the  methodology and assumptions used to develop sales rebates provisions, including provisions related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, by involving audit professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience to assist us in performing our auditing procedures.\n\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to sales rebates, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates.\n\nWe tested rebate claims processed, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the conditions and terms of rebate arrangements.\n\nWe tested the overall reasonableness of the accruals recorded at period end by developing an expectation for comparison to actual recorded balances.\n\nWe evaluated Management's ability to estimate sales rebates accurately by considering the historical accuracy of the estimates in prior year.\n\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of intangible assets, including Management's controls over forecasts of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates.\n\nWe considered the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions affecting future forecasted cash flows and discount rates and performed sensitivity calculations to quantify the impact of changes to Management's forecasted future cash flows and the selection of discount rates.\n\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of Management's key estimates and assumptions related to the forecasted future cash flows by comparing these assumptions to historical results, relevant peer companies, and third-party industry reports.\n\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) valuation assumptions by testing the source information underlying the determination of the valuation assumptions and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

        "page_content": "## Statement on management review\n\nManagement is responsible for the management review.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements does not cover the management review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, our responsibility is to read the management review and, in doing so, consider whether the management review is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nMoreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the management review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the management review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement of the management review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and these parent financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent's internal control.\n- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- - Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of Financial Statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\n- - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and, where applicable, safeguards put in place and measures taken to eliminate threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements of Novo Nordisk A/S, we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 with the file name NOVO2021-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation), which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:\n\n- - The preparing of the annual report in XHTML format;\n- -  The selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;\n- -  Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the consolidated financial statements presented in human readable format; and\n- -For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- -  Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- -  Obtaining an understanding of the Company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- -  Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements;\n- -  Evaluating the appropriateness of the Company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- -Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- -  Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2021 with the file name NOVO-2021-12-31.zip is prepared in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nCopenhagen, 2 February 2022\n\n## Deloitte\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Business Registration No 33 96 35 56\n\nAnders Vad Dons State-Authorised Public Accountant mne25299",

The Novo Nordisk accounting policies and internal control documents contain Management's defined reporting scope for each data type. The criteria for accounting principles are contained within the ESG statement.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on our engagement with Management and in accordance with the agreed scope of work. We have conducted our work in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on greenhouse gas statements, and AA1000 Assurance Standard, AA1000AS (v3) Type 2 Moderate (which is the equivalent to ISAE 3000 limited assurance), and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation.\n\n## We are responsible for:\n\n- -  planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the consolidated ESG statement is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- -  forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained; and\n- -  reporting our conclusion to the Management and broader stakeholders of Novo Nordisk A/S.\n\nDeloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab is subject to International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC) 1 and, accordingly, applies a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  We have complied with the requirements for independence and other\n\nethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, and ethical requirements applicable in Denmark.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Considering the risk of material error, we planned and performed our work to obtain all information and explanations necessary to support our conclusion.\n\n## Work performed\n\n- A. We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement in the ESG statement. To do so, we have:\n- -  conducted interviews with internal stakeholders to understand the key processes and control activities for reporting data;\n- -  obtained an understanding of the key processes and controls for managing, recording and reporting;\n- -  performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported;\n- -  performed analysis of data that have been selected on the basis of risk and materiality;\n- -  made inquiries regarding significant developments in the reported data;\n- -  considered the presentation and disclosure of the ESG statement; and\n- -  assessed that the process for reporting greenhouse gas emissions data follows the principles of relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy outlined in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard Revised edition (2004) and The Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011).\n- B.  Regarding alignment with the AA1000 accounting principles of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness, and Impact we performed the following activities:\n- -    interviewed members of Novo Nordisk's Board of Directors and Executive Management team, representatives of senior management at global and regional levels, as well as key employees in Global Public Affairs and Sustainability to determine their understanding of Novo Nordisk's stakeholders, the mechanisms used to engage them and key issues of interest to each stakeholder group;\n- -  interviewed external stakeholder to determine their perception of Novo Nordisk's stakeholder engagement capabilities, and responsiveness to material concerns of stakeholders;\n- -  reviewed evidence on a selective basis to support the assertions made in these interviews and in the stakeholder engagement description;\n- -  confirmed the systems and procedures to support Novo Nordisk's governance for responsible business conduct and stakeholder relationships; and\n- -  assessed the disclosure and presentation of the stakeholder engagement description.\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nBased on our work and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that in all material respects:\n\n- -  The performance data regarding Environment, Social and Governance, on pages from 85 to 91 in the report, have been stated in accordance with the reporting criteria;\n- -  The description in the report adheres to the principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact set out in AccountAbility's AA1000AP (2018);\n- -  The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of sections 99a, 99b, 99d and 107d of the Danish Financial Statements Act (FSA).\n\n## Observations and recommendations\n\nAccording to AA1000AS, we are required to include observations and recommendations for improvements regarding adherence to AA1000AP. We have no significant recommendations regarding the principles of Materiality, Inclusivity, Responsiveness and Impact. We have communicated to Management a number of minor recommendations for improvement.\n\nCopenhagen, 2 February 2022\n\n## Deloitte\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Business Registration No 33 96 35 56\n\nAnders Vad Dons State Authorised Public Accountant mne25299\n\nHelena Barton Lead Reviewer",

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\n## 1 Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act (Class D) and other accounting regulations for companies listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen.\n\nThe accounting policies for the financial statements of the parent company are unchanged from the previous financial year except for implementation of accounting policy related to goodwill. The accounting policies are the same as for the consolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below. For a description of the accounting policies of the Group, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent company; please refer to the statement of cash flows for the Group.\n\n## Supplementary accounting policies for the parent company\n\n## Financial assets\n\nIn the financial statements of the parent company, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are recorded under the equity method, using the respective share of the net asset values in subsidiaries and associated companies. The equity method is used as a measurement basis rather than a consolidation method. The net profit of subsidiaries and associated companies less unrealised intra-group profits and amortisation of goodwill is recorded in the income statement of the parent company. Goodwill is amortised over no more than 25 years which reflects the useful life of the underlying assets and activities generating the goodwill.\n\nTo the extent that net profit exceeds declared dividends from such companies, the net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associated companies is transferred to net revaluation reserve under equity according to the equity method. Profits in subsidiaries and associated companies are disclosed as profit after tax.\n\nAmounts owed by affiliates, where settlement is neither planned nor likely within the foreseeable future, are treated as part of net-investments in subsidiaries, with exchange rate adjustments recognised directly in equity through reserve for cash flow hedges and exchange rate adjustments.\n\n## Tax\n\nFor Danish tax purposes, the parent company is assessed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. The Danish jointly taxed companies are included in a Danish on-account tax payment scheme for Danish corporate income tax. All current taxes under the scheme are recorded in the individual companies. Novo Nordisk A/S and its Danish subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation of the parent company, Novo Holdings A/S.\n\n## 2 Sales\n\n| DKK million                   | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Sales by business segment     |         |         |\n| Diabetes and Obesity care     | 112,347 | 100,741 |\n| Biopharm                      | 206     | 199     |\n| Total sales                   | 112,553 | 100,940 |\n| Sales by geographical segment |         |         |\n| North America Operations      | 57,654  | 52,054  |\n| International Operations:     |         |         |\n| EMEA                          | 27,124  | 25,124  |\n| China                         | 15,608  | 12,554  |\n| Rest of World                 | 12,167  | 11,208  |\n| Total sales                   | 112,553 | 100,940 |\n\nSales are attributed to a geographical segment based on location of the customer.
