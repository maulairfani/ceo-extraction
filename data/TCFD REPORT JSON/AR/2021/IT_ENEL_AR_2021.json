We also manage the largest customer base in the world among privatesector companies, with more than 69 million customers.\n\nOur business model, which is entirely based on digital platforms, enables us to optimally seize the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities o/ff.ligaered by the energy transition now under way around the globe.\n\nThe solid economic and /fi.liganancial\n\npe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the Enel Group in 2021 made it possible to achieve the objectives we announced to the market, including our targets for EBITDA and ordinary pro/fi.ligat. The Group's leadership in sustainability was once again recognized at the international level by our continuing presence in a number of impo/r\\_t.ligaant sustainability ratings, indices and rankings. In addition, Enel was again included in the main indices that monitor corporate gender diversity pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021 we were again the leading utility by market capitalization in Europe and the second in the world.\n\n## The macroeconomic environment\n\nThe global economy in 2021 experienced a generalized recovery on a global scale, with estimated world GDP growth of about 5.8% on an annual basis, sustained by government fiscal policies and strong monetary stimulus from central banks, as well as by the effective vaccination campaign implemented in many countries starting from the 2nd Quarter of the year. In the United States, GDP expanded by an annual 5.7% in 2021, although the decline in private consumption and industrial production, shortages of raw materials and sharply rising energy prices slowed the economy in the final months of the year. In the euro area, the real economy registered a substantial recovery in 2021, with GDP growing by 5.2% on an annual basis, driven by a strong recovery in the 2nd and 3rd Quarters, although growth slowed in the 4th Quarter due to a rapid increase in energy prices and the introduction of restrictions on economic activity and mobility in response to the spread of the Omicron variant.\n\nThe pattern was similar in Latin America, where economic developments in 2021 were strongly influenced by the progress of national vaccination campaigns, with an average increase in GDP of almost 10%\n\ncompared with the previous year in the main countries in which we operate. The broad-based recovery and the reopening of commercial activities at the beginning of 2021 generated large imbalances between supply and demand, creating severe distortions in supply chains and consequently triggering inflationary pressures that subsequently impacted the prices of intermediate and consumer goods.\n\nDuring 2021, the oil market experienced rapid growth in its indices, re/fl.ligaecting optimism about the recovery in economic activity, combined with the precautionary measures of OPEC regarding production cuts. Considerable volatility was registered in the European gas market, caused by both supply and demand factors, contributing to a sharp increase in prices in the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2021. CO 2 prices also increased, responding to the strong commitment expressed by the European authorities, who expressed their intention to reduce CO 2 emissions by at least 55% by 2030, causing the price of the commodity to rise above \u20ac80/ton at the end of December.\n\nThe bullish pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the commodity markets in 2021 led to a sharp increase in power prices across Europe, which exceeded 220% compared with 2020 in Italy and Spain.",

The resumption of economic activity and the revival of investment have driven demand, while supply has been challenged by availability issues and logistical bottlenecks, generating scarcity on the market with a consequent sharp rise in prices.\n\nThe world scenario, already characterized by high price volatility, was further shaken in February 2022 by the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict is dramatic in its impact on the civilian population and its profound\n\n## Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance\n\nThe Enel Group continued to grow in 2021, hi/t\\_t.ligaing all the objectives announced to the /fi.liganancial community despite the continuing instability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty engendered by the volatility in commodity prices. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the 2021 /fi.liganancial year closed with ordinary EBITDA of \u20ac19.2 billion, with an increase of 6.7% compared with 2020. Ordinary pro/fi.ligat, on which the dividend is calculated, reached \u20ac5.6 billion, an increase\n\nof 8% compared with the previous year. The dividend for 2021 amounts to \u20ac0.38 per share, an increase of 6.1% compared with 2020. In terms of cash generation, FFO in 2021 were about 3% greater than the previous year despite the impact on working capital of the still unstable macroeconomic situation. Net debt is equal to \u20ac52.0 billion, lower than the forecasts previously provided to investors.\n\n## Main developments\n\nAs in previous years, Enel reached a new record for renewables generation capacity in 2021, adding 5,120 MW of new renewables capacity globally, which includes 220 MW of ba/t\\_t.ligaery storage for the /fi.ligarst time, while continuing to grow our project pipeline to 370 GW worldwide. Installed renewables capacity reached 53.4 GW, taking an impo/r\\_t.ligaant step towards the complete decarbonization of the generation mix and divesting 1,983 MW of installed coal-/fi.ligared capacity. (1) For the second consecutive year, 2021\n\nposted a record for renewables generation, with about 118 TWh of output, equal to 51% of the total Group production.\n\nAs a result, the Group reduced speci/fi.ligac CO 2 emissions to 227 gCO 2eq /kWh, a decrease of 45% compared with 2017, continuing progress along the path towards the SBTi ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed target of 82 gCO 2eq /kWh by 2030. Thanks to investments in grids and the simultaneous e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to digitalize systems and processes, we have reached 75 million customers connected to our grids, 60% of which are equipped with sma/r\\_t.liga meters. At the same time, we have exceeded 1 million prosumers (customers who are both consumers and electricity producers) connected to the Group's grids.

In order to meet the new demands on the grid and the new role of distribution system operators (DSOs), the Grid Futurability\u00ae project was launched in 2021 within the scope of COP26, with which the Global Infrastructure and Networks (GI&N) area has delineated a path to 2030 for the renovation, upgrading, digitalization and expansion of power grids.\n\nThe year 2021 was also crucial for the progress of the Grid Blue Sky project, which seeks to redesign the operating model from a platform standpoint, making grid operations signi/fi.ligacantly more e/ffi.ligacient and enabling new services for customers. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, 2021 saw the launch of Gridspe/r\\_t.ligaise, a company born from the Group's successful experience in the /fi.ligaeld of technological and digital innovation of distribution grids, with the aim of making innovative solutions available to third-pa/r\\_t.ligay distribution companies to accelerate the energy transition.\n\nThe Group con/fi.ligarmed its leadership in managing the largest customer base in the world, with 16 retailers, 69 million commodity customers and 7 million beyond-commodity customers. In order to simplify the customer experience and maximize their satisfaction, in April the Global Customer Operations Service Function was created. It is responsible for managing and optimizing the activation, billing, credit and customer care processes, leveraging the platform operating model.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in order to seize the incredible oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities o/ff.ligaered by the electri/fi.ligacation process that will characterize the coming decade, a new global organizational unit named Enel X Global Retail was created with the job of creating a single commercial and marketing strategy directed at end users, integrating the commodity market with the beyond-commodity solutions o/ff.ligaered by the Enel X businesses. Our leadership has grown stronger in the business-togovernment segment, in active demand management services for our industrial customers and in energy storage solutions in the business-to-business segment. In order to fu/r\\_t.ligaher accelerate the electri/fi.ligacation of transpo/r\\_t.liga, we have\n\nlaunched the new Enel X Way in order to lend even more energy to the development of electric mobility, a key business for the energy transition.\n\nAmong extraordinary corporate transactions during the year, the sale of 50% of the share capital of Open Fiber, held by Enel, to Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets and CDP Equity (40% and 10% respectively) closed in December 2021. From a /fi.liganancial point of view, on March 4, 2021, an equity-accounted perpetual hybrid bond was issued in the amount of \u20ac2.25 billion. The transaction increased the Group's hybrid bond po/r\\_t.ligafolio, bringing it to about \u20ac5.6 billion, fu/r\\_t.ligaher strengthening and optimizing the Group's /fi.liganancial structure.\n\nBetween June and September 2021, Enel issued sustainability-linked bonds denominated in euros and US dollars in the total equivalent amount of about \u20ac10.1 billion. These issues are linked to the achievement of Enel's sustainability target for the reduction of direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) and are consistent with the Group's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, updated to January 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Enel repurchased and cancelled outstanding bonds not linked to the pursuit of SDG objectives through two voluntary purchase o/ff.ligaers and the exercise of repurchase options for a total amount of about \u20ac7.4 billion.\n\nThe bond issue and repurchase programs made it possible to achieve a ratio between sustainable sources of /fi.liganancing and the Group's total gross debt of about 55%, simultaneously reducing the cost of the Group's debt to its current 3.5%.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, on March 5, 2021, Enel obtained a revolving 5-year credit line from a pool of banks in the amount of \u20ac10 billion.

Similarly, we expect the electri/fi.ligacation process to characterize the current decade, emerging as a crucial factor for avoiding the grave consequences of a temperature increase above 1.5 \u00b0C compared with preindustrial levels.\n\nWith electri/fi.ligacation, customers will gradually conve/r\\_t.liga their energy consumption to electricity, with gains in terms of cost, e/ffi.ligaciency, emissions and price stability. With the new Strategic Plan, the Group has con/fi.ligarmed the path towards 2030 already under way, increasing investments envisaged in the previous Business Plan by 6% to around \u20ac210 billion in direct and third-pa/r\\_t.ligay investments.\n\nThe Group con/fi.ligarmed the use of two di/ff.ligaerent business models (Ownership and Stewardship) to achieve the objectives we have set, which will be deployed depending on geographical area and operating conditions.\n\nThe strategy and positioning of the Group envisaged for 2030 have made it possible to bring forward the 'Net-Zero' commitment for both direct and indirect emissions by 10 years from 2050 to 2040. With regard to the generation of energy and the sale of electricity and natural gas to end users, Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to achieving zero emissions without reso/r\\_t.ligaing to CO 2 capture techniques or nature-based solutions such as reforestation.\n\nThe Plan underpinning the early achievement of this ambitious goal is based on the implementation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain key strategic steps: (i) the plan to abandon coal and gas generation by 2027 and\n\n2040 respectively, replacing the thermal generation po/r\\_t.ligafolio with new renewables capacity and exploiting the hybridization of renewables with storage solutions; (ii) by 2040, 100% of the electricity sold by the Group will be generated from renewables and by the same year the Group will exit the retail gas sales business.\n\nIn suppo/r\\_t.liga of our long-term targets, in 2022-2024 the Group expects to directly invest around \u20ac45 billion, of which \u20ac43 billion through the Ownership model, mainly in expanding and upgrading grids and in developing renewables and about \u20ac2 billion through the Stewardship model, while mobilizing \u20ac8 billion in investment from third pa/r\\_t.ligaies.\n\nAbout 94% of 2022-2024 consolidated investment is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and it is estimated that more than 85% of this investment will be aligned with the criteria of the European taxonomy.\n\nThe Group expects to increase the renewables capacity it manages to some 77 GW by the end of 2024, with zero-emission output reaching about 77% of the total, with a decrease in speci/fi.ligac greenhouse gas emissions of more than 35% in the same period.\n\nIn distribution grids, the acceleration of investment, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities created with the National Recovery and Resilience Plans launched by the European Union, will expand the Group's regulatory asset base (RAB) by 14% to about \u20ac49 billion in 2024, making it possible to reach a total of some 81 million customers served, 4 million of which through the Stewardship model.\n\nThe central role of our customers in the Group's business model makes the integrated margin a pillar of our Plan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consideration was also given to the indicators proposed in the white paper 'Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Repo/r\\_t.ligaing of Sustainable Value Creation' of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the details of which are highlighted in the section below on the WEF and in the 'Group Performance' chapter of this Repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, an economic activity is de/fi.liganed as environmentally sustainable if:\n\n- \u00b7 it does no signi/fi.ligacant harm (DNSH) to the other /fi.ligave environmental objectives;\n- \u00b7 it makes a substantive contribution to at least one of the six environmental objectives;\n- \u00b7 it meets minimum safeguards.\n\nThe  European  taxonomy  provides  a  standardized,  science-based classi/fi.ligacation system to identify environmen-\n\n## The European taxonomy implementation process at Enel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAssessment of the principle of Do No Signi/fi.ligacant Harm (DNSH) to other environmental objectives\n\nThrough a process overseen by the CEO and top management, involving the competent functions at the company and country level as well as all Business Lines, /fi.ligave steps have been identi/fi.ligaed to analyze the applicability of the European taxonomy along the entire value chain in all countries in which the Group operates.\n\n- 1.  Identi/fi.ligacation of eligible economic activities : all the activities within the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio included in the Cli-\n\nmate Delegated Act have been identi/fi.ligaed. The process only considered the climate change mitigation objective as it is the most material objective in consideration of the Enel Group's business model and the sector in which we operate.\n\n- 2.  Analysis of substantial contribution : the eligible activities identi/fi.ligaed in the previous phase were carefully analyzed to verify their compliance with the speci/fi.ligac tech-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntally sustainable economic activities and thus acts as an impo/r\\_t.ligaant enabler to promote sustainable investment and accelerate the decarbonization of the European economy, while at the same time creating security and transparency for investors and suppo/r\\_t.ligaing businesses in planning the Net Zero transition.\n\nAlthough the taxonomy regulation establishes an obligation for unde/r\\_t.ligaakings to declare compliance with the taxonomy from January 2022, Enel has positioned itself as leader and elected to announce implementation in the previous  2020  Sustainability  Repo/r\\_t.liga  and  the  Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga 2020 as well as during the 2020 and 2021 Capital Markets Days.\n\nEU taxonomy repo/r\\_t.ligaing pursuant to the regulation and the delegated act is provided in full in the 2021 Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga - Non-Financial Statement pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/852.",

        "page_content": "nical criteria established to measure their substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The analysis was conducted following the criteria contained in the Climate Delegated Act, namely:\n\n- -technology screening for electricity generation. The threshold of 100 gCO 2eq /kWh measured on a life-cycle basis was complied with as follows:\n- \u00b7 coal and liquid fossil fuels: technology non included in the European taxonomy;\n- \u00b7 gas and nuclear: on February 2, 2022, the European Commission approved in principle a Complementary Delegated Act on climate which includes, under strict conditions, activities related to nuclear energy and gas in the list of economic activities covered by the European taxonomy. At the time of publication of this Repo/r\\_t.liga, the Complementary Delegated Act is going through the approval process with the European Parliament and the Council. In these circumstances, the legislation is not yet /fi.liganalized and therefore the production of electricity from gas and nuclear activities has been considered as 'non-eligible';\n- \u00b7 wind, solar and energy storage: these activities are exempt from the veri/fi.ligacation of the carbon intensity threshold due to their substantial contribution to climate change mitigation;\n- \u00b7 hydroelectric energy: the carbon intensity threshold was veri/fi.ligaed only for those plants whose power density is less than 5 W/m 2 . All plants with power densities greater than 5W/m 2 as well as run-of-theriver plants and pumping facilities are exempt from veri/fi.ligacation of the threshold;\n- \u00b7 geothermal: the threshold was veri/fi.ligaed by carrying out life-cycle emissions assessments ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by independent third pa/r\\_t.ligaies;\n- -geographical and system level screening for electricity transmission and distribution. For the purposes of classifying activities as eligible, compliance with one of the following technical screening criteria was veri/fi.ligaed in all eight countries wherein which Enel distributes electricity:\n- \u00b7 the distribution system operator (DSO) is the European interconnected system;\n- \u00b7 the non-European DSO operates a system in which more than 67% of newly enabled generation capacity is below the threshold value of 100 gCO 2eq /kWh measured on a life-cycle basis in the 2016-2020 period;\n- \u00b7 the average emissions factor of the non-European DSO network is below the threshold value of 100 gCO 2eq /kWh measured on a life-cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria in the 2016-2020 period.\n\nInfrastructure constructed in 2021 and dedicated to the creation of a direct connection or expanding an\n\n- existing direct connection between a substation or network and a power production plant that is more greenhouse  gas  intensive  than  100  gCO 2eq /kWh measured on a life-cycle basis has been identi/fi.ligaed and excluded from the aligned activities of the DSOs;\n- -provisioning screening for retail electricity activities. The amount of power sold by electricity sales companies in Italy and Spain suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by Ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates of Origin was calculated and considered to be aligned with the European taxonomy due to its compliance with the technical screening criteria established in the Climate Delegated Act for electricity generation.\n- -product cluster screening for the Enel X Business Line. A complete analysis of the Enel X po/r\\_t.ligafolio was conducted, classifying the eligible activities in the sectors identi/fi.ligaed in the Climate Delegated Act, such as construction and real estate, transpo/r\\_t.liga or professional, scienti/fi.ligac and technical activities;\n- 3.  Analysis of compliance with the principle of not causing signi/fi.ligacant harm to other objectives (Do No Signi/fi.ligacant Harm - DNSH) : an analysis of existing environmental procedures was pe/r\\_f.ligaormed to verify compliance with the DNSH quality criteria for each technology (for power generation activities), region (for transmission and distribution activities) and product cluster (for the activities of the Enel X Business Line), adapted to the speci/fi.ligac requirements envisaged for each environmental objective.\n- 4.  Due  diligence  assessment  of  compliance  with  minimum social guarantees : we veri/fi.ligaed that the due diligence process for the Group's human rights assessments includes the entire Enel Group.\n- 5. Calculation of /fi.liganancial metrics : the corresponding /fi.liganancial metrics were associated with each economic activity in accordance with the classi/fi.ligacation pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in steps 1-4, as described in the 'Statement on the alignment of Enel's business with the European taxonomy' section of the 'Group Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance' chapter.\n\nUsing this process, Enel has classi/fi.ligaed all the economic activities along its value chain in the following three categories: eligible-aligned, eligible-not aligned, non-eligible.\n\nEligible-aligned : this refers to an economic activity that simultaneously meets the following three conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 it meets the speci/fi.ligac criteria in the European taxonomy regulation for this speci/fi.ligac environmental objective;\n- \u00b7 it is explicitly included in the European taxonomy regulation for its substantial contribution to climate change mitigation;\n- \u00b7 it meets all DNSH criteria and minimum protection guarantees.",

        "page_content": "## Business model\n\nEnel's business model has been structured so as to Group's strategic objectives, including the commitments made by the Group in the /fi.ligaght against climate change.\n\nThe business model delineates how the organizational units of the Company, linked to our three main businesses (generation, distribution and sales), must work to reap all the possible bene/fi.ligats from the main trends in the sector, possibly accelerating their implementation as well.\n\nThe role de/fi.liganed for all the major organizational units is also intended to enable them to e/ff.ligaectively address all the risks posed by developments in the rapidly changing energy industry.\n\nIn order to fully bene/fi.ligat from all the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities emerging in the market environment in which it operates, the Group has identi/fi.ligaed two di/ff.ligaerent business models (Ownership and Stewardship) that it can use to achieve the ambitions we have de/fi.liganed. The most appropriate and e/ff.ligaective business model is selected depending on the geographical area and operating environment involved:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Ownership  business  model,  in  which  the  Group makes direct investments in renewables, grids and customers. This model is employed in countries where the entire value chain can already be leveraged, from generation to integration with end user. These are de/fi.liganed as 'Tier 1' countries, such as Italy, Spain and Romania in Europe and the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru in the Americas. The central role of our customers in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTrading\n\nthe Group's business model makes the integrated margin a pillar of our Plan. This is the margin from the sale of power generated and purchased, the correct management of which requires the joint optimization of both sales of power, considering the di/ff.ligaerent options available in the countries in which we operate, and provisioning, which is linked to our generation rather than to the di/ff.ligaerent sourcing options;\n\n- \u00b7 the Stewardship business model, in which the Group invests capital in existing or new joint ventures or acquires minority stakes, with a view to maximizing the value of the know-how developed in the various businesses in which it operates. This is achieved through the delivery of speci/fi.ligac contractual services to pa/r\\_t.liganers or the subsequent monetization of these investments on the market. This model focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on 'non-Tier 1' countries, where the Group's presence is not integrated and it seeks to build pa/r\\_t.liganerships with third pa/r\\_t.ligaies to explore new geographical areas or to leverage the Group's operational experience in alternative environments.\n\nIn this design, each country organization acts within its territory in a matrix relationship with the broader and more global Business Lines, managing activities such as relations with local communities, regulation, the retail market and local communication. The current mission of each business can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation: the Group operates through this Business Line to accelerate the energy transition, continuing to increase investments in new renewable energy capacity, and manages the decarbonization of its generation mix and the countries in which it operates, always aiming to ensure the safety and capacity of electrical systems.\n- \u00b7 Global Energy and Commodity Management: this Business Line manages our integrated margin as a single po/r\\_t.ligafolio in which Generation and Retail operations are always balanced e/ff.ligaectively. In addition, the Line manages all trading operations on international desks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The business units optimize the supply of power to their customer base, maximizing the value generated by that resource and fostering longterm relationships with customers.\n- \u00b7 Enel X: this Business Line is enabling the energy transition by acting as an accelerator for the electri/fi.ligacation and decarbonization of customers, helping them to use energy more e/ffi.ligaciently, driving circularity and leveraging the assets of the Enel Group through the delivery of innovative beyond-commodity services.\n\nIn 2021, the Enel X Global Retail and Global e-Mobility Business Lines were formed but will only begin operations from 2022.\n\nEnel X Global Retail is involved in managing energy and beyond-commodity services, as well as expanding the customer base while maximizing value for customers, innovating and developing the services o/ff.ligaered and managing the entire life cycle.\n\nGlobal e-Mobility is responsible for managing the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of e-Mobility solutions in both existing and new countries, maximizing value for customers and leveraging Enel\n\nX Global Retail for sales activities.

This system is embodied in a dynamic set of rules constantly oriented towards incorporating national and international best practices that everyone who works for and with Enel must respect and apply in their daily activities. The system is based on speci/fi.ligac compliance programs,\n\nincluding: the Code of Ethics, the Compliance Model under Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Enel Global Compliance Program, the Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan, the Human Rights Policy, and any other national compliance models adopted by Group companies in accordance with local laws and regulations.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nIn 2002, Enel adopted a Code of Ethics, which expresses the Company's ethical responsibilities and commitments in conducting business, governing and standardizing corporate conduct on the basis of standards aimed to ensure the maximum transparency and fairness with all stakeholders.\n\nThe Code of Ethics is valid in Italy and abroad, taking due account of the cultural, social and economic diversity of the various countries in which the Group operates. Enel also requires that all associates and other investees and its main suppliers and pa/r\\_t.liganers adopt conduct that is in line with the general principles set out in the Code. Any violations  or  suspected  violations  of  Enel  Compliance\n\nPrograms can be repo/r\\_t.ligaed, including in anonymous form, through a single Group-level platform (the 'Ethics Point'). In February 2021, the Board of Directors approved a fu/r\\_t.ligaher update of the Code of Ethics in order to align its content with the current context, including the current corporate mission and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the current organizational structure and the system of procedures, as well as national and international best practices in the areas of diversity and privacy.\n\nWith regard to the Code of Ethics, the following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the average number of training hours per person, total repo/r\\_t.ligas of violations received and violations con/fi.ligarmed.\n\n|                                                                     |     |   2021 |   2020 |   Change | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Total repo/r\\_t.ligaed violations of the Code of Ethics received     | no. |    153 |    151 |        2 | 1.3%     |\n| Con/fi.ligarmed violations of the Code of Ethics                    | no. |     41 |     26 |       15 | 57.7%    |\n| - of which violations involving con/fl.ligaicts of interest/bribery | no. |      7 |      2 |        5 | -        |\n\n## Compliance Model under Legislative Decree 231/2001\n\nLegislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001 introduced into Italian law a system of administrative (and de facto criminal) liability for companies for ce/r\\_t.ligaain types of o/ff.ligaenses commi/t\\_t.ligaed by their directors, managers or employees on behalf of or to the bene/fi.ligat of the company.

It is a governance mechanism aimed at strengthening the Group's ethical and professional commitment to preventing the commission of crimes abroad that could result in criminal liability for the company and do harm to our reputation. Identi/fi.ligacation of the types of crime covered by the\n\nEnel Global Compliance Program - which encompasses standards of conduct and areas to be monitored for preventive purposes - is based on illicit conduct that is generally considered such in most countries, such as corruption, crimes against the government, false accounting, money laundering, violations of regulations governing safety in the workplace, environmental crimes, etc.\n\n## Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan and the anti-bribery management system\n\nIn compliance with the tenth principle of the Global Compact, according to which 'businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including exto/r\\_t.ligaion and bribery', Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to combating corruption. For this reason, in 2006 we adopted the 'Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan' (ZTC Plan), con/fi.ligarming the Group's commitment, as described in both the Code of Ethics and the Model 231, to ensure propriety and transparency in conducting com-\n\npany business and operations and to safeguard our image and positioning, the work of our employees, the expectations of shareholders and all of the Group's stakeholders.

All of these improvement plans are also integrated into the Sustainability Plan.\n\nIn the 2020-2022 cycle, some 170 actions have been identi/fi.ligaed, covering 100% of operations and sites.\n\nAs more speci/fi.ligacally regards the sustainability of the supply chain, human rights pe/r\\_f.ligaormance is evaluated for all potential suppliers through a dedicated questionnaire in which the characteristics of potential suppliers are analyzed with regard to inclusion and diversity, protection of workers' privacy, veri/fi.ligacation of their supply chain, forced or child labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and application of fair working conditions (including adequate wages and working hours). As enshrined in the Human Rights Policy, in addition to guaranteeing the necessary quality standards, supplier pe/r\\_f.ligaormance must go hand in hand with the commitment to adopt best practices in terms of human rights and working conditions (including appropriate working hours, no forced or child labor, respect for personal dignity, non-discrimination and inclusion of diversity, freedom of association and collective bargaining), workplace health and safety, environmental responsibility and respect for privacy by design and by  default.  Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore,  general  contractual  terms  and conditions expressly provide for suppliers to unde/r\\_t.ligaake to adopt and implement, among other things, the principles contained in the Human Rights Policy and in the Group's Code of Ethics and to comply with International Labor Organization conventions or legislation in force in the country in which activities are to be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed, if more restrictive, and in accordance with the principles of the Global Compact that Enel has adopted, ensuring that such principles are met in the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of all activities both by a supplier's employees and its subcontractors.",

To determine the framework in which we operate, we conduct in-depth scenario planning in order to be prepared to seize oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and manage future risks and unce/r\\_t.ligaainties in the most robust manner possible. This analysis of what could happen in the external landscape, together with the Group's purpose and our Open Power mission, is key to de/fi.liganing the Group's positioning within that landscape. We then de/fi.ligane our long-term ambitions and design the strategic options that characterize our long-term planning.\n\nIn recent years, the increasing complexity of the rapidly changing context in which we operate has made it so that the process of de/fi.liganing the Group's strategies has also evolved in order to capture as much of this dynamism as possible, so as to make it an enabling factor in the de/fi.liga-\n\nnition of goals.\n\nToday, this process is organized into the following main activities:\n\n- \u00b7 strategic  dialogue :  a  continuous  process  of  active dialogue  throughout  the  year  and  across  all  Group functions, through which the strategic topics for the evolution and growth of the Group are identi/fi.ligaed, analyzed, discussed and addressed. This dialogue is pa/r\\_t.liga of  a  strategic  design  phase,  where  communication between executives makes a valuable contribution to developing new strategic options, with an emphasis on the need for cultural or organizational change and synergies between businesses. This process, which is coordinated at the Group level, /fi.ligarst involves the identi/fi.ligacation of topics through consensus among senior management and approval by the CEO. The next phase of the strategic dialogue process involves the structuring of agile working groups with all the professional expe/r\\_t.ligaise necessary for the proper analysis of each topic, aimed at the preparation of dedicated workshops or strategic options to be discussed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe process is centrally governed and includes milestones and deadlines that are de/fi.liganed based, in pa/r\\_t.liga, on the relative priority of the decisions to be made. In 2021, the working groups created for the various topics were organized around strategic priorities (e.g., Electri/fi.ligacation, Value for the entire System, Decarbonization, Platforms and the Digital Transition, etc.). This process enables us to properly de/fi.ligane oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities related to each strategic topic (including any /fi.liganancial or operational impacts) and a roadmap for the implementation of any actions to be taken. The outputs are then discussed by top management in dedicated meetings. These meetings include one special event, the Top Team O/ff.ligasite\n\nmeeting,  at  which  all  senior  management  discusses the priority topics. The most signi/fi.ligacant conclusions are then included in the Group's long-term planning. This is then followed by the Strategic Summit, usually organized in October in order to discuss the annual update of the Strategic Plan with the Board of Directors. This framework  enables  governance  of  the  treatment  of strategic issues, while at the same time ensuring swift identi/fi.ligacation  of  emerging  trends  and  the  necessary cross-business involvement for a complete analysis of complex and interdependent issues in the presence of an organizational structure based on the country/Business Line/Service Functions matrix;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The most recent scenarios all indicate that we will need to accelerate the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption and decarbonize electricity generation in order to achieve our ambitious climate goals. Our customers will play an active role and be the primary bene/fi.ligaciaries of this process.\n\nOver the last 10 years, renewable energy has become the dominant trend in power generation thanks to declining costs,  thereby  enabling  decarbonization  to  move  at  a more rapid pace. It has been a decade of radical change in the power generation mix, and this is destined to continue accelerating. The coming decade will be crucial in achieving the goals set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. At the same time, it will also be a period characterized by increasing e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas in electri/fi.ligacation, whereby customers will gradually conve/r\\_t.liga their energy consumption to the electrical grid, which will improve spending levels, e/ffi.ligaciency, emissions, and price stability.\n\nIn order to respond more e/ff.ligaectively to the expected acceleration in investment and contribute to more rapidly achieving the primary goals that are needed to combat climate change, the Enel Group intends to leverage the progress we have made in digitalization, as well as our\n\npe/r\\_f.ligaorm ESG and materiality analysis was developed on the basis of the guidelines set out in numerous international standards (for example, the Global Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Initiative - GRI, UN Global Compact, SDG Compass, etc.), with the aim of identifying and evaluating priorities for stakeholders and integrating them into Group strategy.\n\nThe strategy of the Enel Group has proven its ability to create sustainable long-term value, fully integrating the themes of sustainability and close a/t\\_t.ligaention to climate change issues while simultaneously ensuring increased pro/fi.ligatability.\n\nThe Group is among the leaders guiding the energy transition through the decarbonization of electricity generation and other activities and the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, which represent oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities both to increase value creation for all and to contribute positively to more rapid achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United National (SDGs) in the 2030 Agenda.\n\nposition as:\n\n- \u00b7 the world's primary private-sector network operator, with more than 75 million network customers;\n- \u00b7 the world's leading private-sector player in renewable energy, with a total global capacity of about 53.4 GW;\n- \u00b7 the private-sector player with the world's largest base of retail customers, with more than 69 million retail customers worldwide.\n\nOur business model In order to take full advantage of all the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities emerging in the marketplace in which we operate, the Group has established the Ownership and Stewardship business models. The most appropriate and e/ff.ligaective business model is selected based on the geographical area and context of operations:\n\n- \u00b7 the Stewardship business model, by which the Group invests in new joint ventures (JVs), existing JVs or acquires minority interests in order to maximize the value of the know-how we have developed in the various businesses in which we have a presence. This is done\n- \u00b7 the Ownership business model, by which the Group invests directly in renewable energy, grids and customers. This model is used when operating in countries in which we can leverage the entire value chain, from power generation to integration with the end user. Accordingly, we refer to these countries as 'Tier 1', and they include Italy, Spain and Romania in Europe, and the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru in the Americas;",

Moving sustainable Net Zero goals up to 2040 The Group's strategy and positioning planned for 2030 enable us to a/ffi.ligarm our intention to move up achievement of Paris Agreement's Net Zero commitment by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, for both direct and indirect emissions. Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to achieving zero emissions, without the use of any carbon-removal technologies or nature-based solutions,  related  to  power  generation  and  the  sale  of electricity and natural gas to end users.\n\nThe plan by which the Group expects to reach this ambitious goal ahead of our original schedule is based on the implementation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain key strategic steps: (i) the expectation to accelerate the decarbonization of generation, progressively replacing our thermal po/r\\_t.ligafolio with new renewables capacity while also taking advantage of the hybridization of renewables with storage solutions; (ii) by 2040, the electricity sold by the Group will be 100% renewable and we will exit the retail sale of natural gas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Including 3.3 GW of managed renewable capacity.\n\n## Investment plan\n\nThe Group's investment plan is fully aligned with its goal of achieving net zero by 2040 (in line with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C). Consequently, investments in carbon-intensive assets or products will gradually decline to zero by 2040.\n\nIn line with this vision, over the next decade the Group expects to directly invest some \u20ac160 billion under the Ownership business model, mainly in 'Tier 1' countries. More speci/fi.ligacally:\n\n- \u00b7 nearly half (\u20ac70 billion approximately) will be dedicated to our Renewables business, where we expect an increase of about 84 GW in capacity compared with 2020, 9 GW of which in storage, to bring our consolidated renewable energy installed capacity to 129 GW\n\nby 2030. We expect this outcome to be achieved by developing a growing pipeline, equal to about 370 GW and more than doubling since last year, along with three global platforms for the activities of Business Development, Engineering and Construction, and Operations and Maintenance;\n\n- \u00b7 an additional investment of about \u20ac70 billion is planned for the Infrastructure and Networks business, up \u20ac10 billion from the previous plan and concentrated in Europe, with the goal of strengthening the Group's position as a global player in terms of size, quality, e/ffi.ligaciency, and resilience.

This  commitment  calls  for:  (i)  the 100% reduction of direct emissions (Scope 1) and of indirect emissions related to gas sales (Scope 3 Gas); (ii) a reduction of at least 90% in all other indirect emissions (Scopes 2 and 3). This objective requires not only a sharp acceleration in renewables and energy e/ffi.ligaciency, but also a complete rethinking of the economic model and investment planning. Over the next 10 years, the Strategic Plan presented by Enel in November 2021 describes how the massive  investments  envisaged  through  the  Ownership business model are consistent with the objective of reducing direct emissions (Scope 1) to 82 gCO 2eq /kWh by 2030, an objective that has been ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario set out in the Paris Agreement.

This will allow the share of 'emission-free' generation to grow from 65% in 2020 to over 85% in 2030 and, consequently, to cut direct emissions from 211 gCO 2eq /kWh in 2020 to 82 gCO 2eq /kWh in 2030.\n\nThe goal of achieving total decarbonization by 2040 requires a complete rethinking of the economic model in terms of circularity.\n\nAccordingly, Enel is acting on the main lever of direct emissions and at the same time rethinking its business model in a broader sense to act on all other dimensions.\n\nThe Group has increased both awareness of and transparency around all categories of indirect emissions. Despite the fact that repo/r\\_t.ligaing on indirect emissions is voluntary, Enel has prepared a more in-depth repo/r\\_t.liga of emissions from fuel extraction and transpo/r\\_t.liga, grid losses, self-consumption, and supplier relations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is the most ambitious of the scenarios de/fi.liganed by the IEA and was developed with the goal of reducing emissions by the energy system in line with the goal of containing the average increase in global temperatures to within +1.5 \u00b0C. Compared with the IEA's other scenarios, there is a gap to be closed in emission reductions by way of a sharp acceleration in terms of policies and in terms of the rate of electri/fi.ligacation and the development of renewables capacity. Like all IEA scenarios, this scenario, too, is based on currently known industrial processes and consumption models and on existing technologies and does not include any disruptive technologies that could emerge in the coming years.\n\nThe IEA NZE scenario is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly useful to help businesses assess the sustainability of their strategies in relation to a scenario of net-zero emissions by 2050. The roadmap to net-zero emissions set out in this scenario provides helpful, global and regional signposts in terms\n\n## The Sustainability Plan\n\nPeople centricity is one of the pillars of Enel's sustainability strategy.\n\nThe Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to providing the best conditions and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for the people who work for us, with the goal of facing the challenges of the energy transition in line with the United Nations' just-transition commitment signed in 2019. Upskilling, reskilling and speci/fi.ligac training in digital skills are being paired with action plans for employee development and valuing diversity aimed at creating an inclusive workplace by way of detailed objectives, including in terms of listening to employees and evaluating their performance. Within this context, the Group has raised targets, compared with the previous year, related to the percentages of female senior managers and middle managers to 26.8% and 33.4%, respectively, by 2024.\n\nAt the same time, one of the pillars of our sustainability strategy centers on the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of the relationship with the local communities in which the Group operates, with the commitment, for the period 2015-2030, to reach: 5 million bene/fi.ligaciaries of a quality education (SDG 4); 20 million bene/fi.ligaciaries of clean, accessible energy (SDG 7); and 8 million bene/fi.ligaciaries of decent work and lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8).\n\nTo suppo/r\\_t.liga the Group's sustainability strategy, a focus on health and safety throughout the value chain continues to\n\nof the evolution and penetration of technologies deemed necessary to reach this goal. Nonetheless, local details are not always available in order to test more granular business assumptions and hypotheses.\n\nAs for Enel's strategy, the main points of note are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 forecasts of end-use electri/fi.ligacation that, in accordance with the IEA NZE roadmap, call for milestones that would leave room for additional business oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities due, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, to the segments of transpo/r\\_t.ligaation (e.g., 60% of global car sales must be electric vehicles, no new combustion-engine cars by 2035, etc.) and heating and air conditioning.\n- \u00b7 exit from gas-/fi.ligared generation by 2040, with a roadmap that does not call for any carbon-removal technologies or solutions, which are not compatible with the Group's strategic or technological positioning. Therefore, this is a target of zero, not 'net' zero, direct emissions characterized by power generation that is entirely renewable;\n\nbe of central impo/r\\_t.ligaance, made possible by way of constant, increasing monitoring. The Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to promoting issues of sustainability and quality in supplier relations throughout the supply chain. Also crucial is environmental management aimed at reducing emissions, the consumption of water and other natural resources, and the preservation of biodiversity, and a strong governance structure continues to be a cornerstone of Group strategy. Finally, the energy transition must include enabling factors such as digitalization and cyber security, by way of which the Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to promoting the most advanced solutions and actions to verify them (e.g., ethical hacking, vulnerability assessments, and cyber exercises involving industrial plant and facilities).\n\nThe adoption of a fully sustainable business model requires us to completely rethink the concept of circularity. The circular economy is fundamental for two reasons in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular: on the one hand, it is an indispensable lever in achieving the goals of decarbonization throughout the value chain, (5) as well as making a positive contribution to resolving a series of other critical environmental issues in terms of the use of soil, water consumption, the creation of waste, etc.; on the other, the large-scale adoption of technologies such as photovoltaic power, ba/t\\_t.ligaeries, and electrical mobility requires, right from the sta/r\\_t.liga, a circular",

More speci/fi.ligacally, the mid- and long-term strategies are fully in line with the following strategic actions.\n\n- I. Allocating capital to suppo/r\\_t.liga the delivery of decarbonized electricity\n\nThe Group plans to directly invest a total of around \u20ac45 billion over the period 2022-2024, an increase of 12% above the previous Plan, while also mobilizing an additional \u20ac8 billion from third pa/r\\_t.ligaies within the scope of the Stewardship business model.\n\nFor the period 2022-2024, the Group plans to invest some \u20ac43 billion within the Ownership business model, aligning  94%  with  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Develop-\n\nrcularity by way of repo/r\\_t.ligaing and consulting services. A transition of this so/r\\_t.liga requires a change both in technology and business models, methods of interaction within the value chain and the functioning of the economic model writ large. To this end, Enel is collaborating with businesses, organizations and stakeholders in all countries in which we have a presence. All of this will also require a profound transformation in skills and professionalism, for which we are placing a great deal of emphasis on training and on new approaches to collaboration between the various areas of the Group.\n\nWe have also seen growing interest in this issue in recent years from the /fi.liganancial services industry, and Enel has, for some time now, been supplementing our e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas with a view to /fi.liganancing in order to ensure that new initiatives are designed from the sta/r\\_t.liga to be /fi.liganancially competitive (and so scalable) and to contribute to the pro/fi.ligatability and derisking of Group pe/r\\_f.ligaormance overall.\n\nment Goals (SDGs). Speci/fi.ligacally, these funds will be aimed at achieving the targets of SDG 7 ('A/ff.ligaordable and Clean Energy'), SDG 9 ('Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure'), and SDG 11 ('Sustainable Cities and Communities'), thereby helping to combat climate change (SDG 13 - 'Climate Action').\n\nThe alignment of the investments envisaged in the Group's Strategic Plan with decarbonization and greenhouse gas reduction objectives is de/fi.liganed on the basis of a speci/fi.ligac methodology in which investments in renewables and retail power by their very nature fall under SDG 7, investments in the distribution grid fall under SDG 9 and investments in Enel X concern SDG 11. The 94% mentioned above therefore excludes investments in conventional generation and retail gas.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, it is estimated that between 80% and 90% of planned investments will be aligned with the criteria of the European taxonomy, given the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Reference scenario\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe world economic environment in 2021 was characterized by a broad-based economic recovery, with world GDP growth of about 5.8% on an annual basis in 2021, following a sharp drop of about 3.5% the previous year. This recovery was made possible - especially in more developed countries - with signi/fi.ligacant /fi.ligascal suppo/r\\_t.liga from governments and rapid and e/ff.ligaective vaccination, which prevented the introduction of signi/fi.ligacant restrictions on economic activity and mobility, especially in the 2nd Half of the year. However, the di/ff.ligaerences in the pace of vaccination between developed and developing countries was also substantially re/fl.ligaected in the GDP growth rates, engendering clear disparities in the recovery of the di/ff.ligaerent economies.\n\nThe generalized reopening of countries at the beginning of 2021 in concomitance with the initial roll out of vaccines generated sharp imbalances between supply and demand on a global scale, creating large disto/r\\_t.ligaions in supply chains and, consequently, pushing up the prices of raw materials. These in/fl.ligaationary pressures also spilled over into the prices of intermediate and consumer goods, creating a surge in in/fl.ligaation spiral that, accompanied by severe bo/t\\_t.ligalenecks due to logistical hurdles, is expected to continue in 2022.\n\nIn the advanced countries, the 2nd Half of the year was marked by an unexpected economic slowdown, re/fl.ligaecting interrelated factors such as an upturn in COVID-19 cases driven by the spread of new variants on a global scale and bo/t\\_t.ligalenecks associated with logistical challenges. With resurgent demand buoyed by the reopening of economies, limits on production accompanied by the already rising prices of commodities have generated severe in/fl.ligaationary pressures, boosting in/fl.ligaation to record levels.\n\nUS GDP grew by 5.7% on an annual basis in 2021, but in the 2nd Half expanded more slowly than expected at the beginning of the year due to general slowdowns in private consumption and industrial production in connection with the various waves of COVID-19, the reduction of the government suppo/r\\_t.liga for private individuals that marked the /fi.ligarst months of the pandemic, sho/r\\_t.ligaages of raw materials and sharply higher energy prices. For 2022, projections con/fi.ligarm a slowdown in the economy as the suppo/r\\_t.liga provided by excess private saving, which helped fuel the recovery in early 2021, will dissipate. Another factor will be the shift in the monetary policy stance to a less accommodative posture with the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would begin tapering its purchases of securities and could increase its main o/ffi.ligacial rates as early as this year. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, signi/fi.ligacant risks linked to the pandemic, in/fl.ligaation pressures at least until the end of\n\nthe year, and political unce/r\\_t.ligaainty connected with the midterm elections in November 2022 persist.\n\nIn the euro area, the real economy posted a strong recovery in both the 2nd and 3rd Qua/r\\_t.ligaers of 2021, with annual GDP growing by 5.2%. However, the economic recovery slowed in the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer due to steep increases in energy prices and the resurgence of COVID-19 with the Omicron variant, which prompted many countries to reintroduce business closures and restrictions on mobility. The price increases in the energy sector represent a crucial risk factor, especially for industrial production, which is more sensitive than private consumption, and therefore for the outlook for growth in 2022. However, in/fl.ligaationary pressures associated with the high prices of electricity and natural gas will have heterogeneous impacts within the euro area, and investment will receive signi/fi.ligacant suppo/r\\_t.liga from the Next Generation EU recovery plan. Finally, the monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank will remain accommodative in 2022, although it has been announced that the massive pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) will be gradually tapered, but not before March.\n\nIn Latin America, the progress of national vaccination campaigns led to a steep drop in COVID-19 cases in the 2nd Half of 2021. The associated reopening of national economies coincided with a global increase in food and energy prices, weak local currencies and periods of severe drought in several large areas of the continent. These factors produced a general increase in the price level, with in/fl.ligaation well above the targets of many local central banks. The Argentine economy has shown signs of recovery, with GDP growing by 9.8% on an annual basis in 2021. Structural problems persist, mainly concerning in/fl.ligaation and the public /fi.liganances, but negotiations with the International Monetary Fund continue on a debt restructuring to avoid default in 2022. In Brazil, most sectors of the economy recovered to pre-pandemic levels, with GDP growth estimated at an annual 4.7% in 2021. High levels of in/fl.ligaation prompted a restrictive monetary policy stance, which, combined with the limited contribution of reopening to growth as a result of the vaccination process, is moving the country towards a 2022 of stag/fl.ligaation. Fu/r\\_t.ligaher downside risks are represented by political unce/r\\_t.ligaainty, with the previous President Lula favored for the upcoming elections. In 2021, the Chilean economy was driven by an upturn in  private  consumption  and  investment,  which  produced GDP growth of 12% on annual basis. Current risks are mainly represented by the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties associated with the choices that the newly elected leftist candidate Gabriel Boric will\n\n<!-- image -->",

After peaking in October, with the spread of new COVID-19 variants, prices began to ease, falling below $75/barrel in December.\n\nIn 2021, the European gas market experienced considerable volatility, caused by both supply and demand factors. In the 1st Half of the year, lower than average temperatures and\n\na heating season that lasted until May led to a progressive depletion of gas inventories in Europe, with a consequent increase in demand during the summer months.\n\nOn the supply side, however, LNG expo/r\\_t.ligas from the United States have been a/t\\_t.ligaracted to the Asian market, fu/r\\_t.ligaher exacerbating the commodity's scarcity.\n\nThe rise in gas prices, combined with strong Chinese demand, in turn led to an increase in coal prices, which peaked at $231 per metric ton in October, before falling below $150 per metric ton in November following the reopening of a number of mines in China, which eased supply-side strains.\n\n|          |          | 2021   | 2020   | Change   |\n|----------|----------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Brent    | $/barrel | 71     | 43     | 65.1%    |\n| API2     | $/ton    | 120    | 50     | -        |\n| TTF      | \u20ac/MWh    | 46     | 9      | -        |\n| CO 2     | \u20ac/ton    | 53     | 25     | -        |\n| Copper   | $/ton    | 9,310  | 6,177  | 50.7%    |\n| Aluminum | $/ton    | 2,472  | 1,704  | 45.1%    |\n| Nickel   | $/ton    | 18,461 | 13,787 | 33.9%    |\n\nThe prices of CO 2 in the ETS are also increasing, following the strong commitment expressed by the European authorities, culminating in the approval in July of the 'Fit for 55' package, an expression of the desire to reduce CO 2 emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Expectations of rising prices, combined with strains in the gas market and the increase in speculative positions in this market, produced an increase in the price of the commodity, which at the end of December stood above \u20ac80/ton.\n\nSimilarly to developments in energy commodities, 2021 was a very volatile year, characterized by sharp increases in the prices of the main industrial metals as well. The resumption of post-COVID-19 economic activities and the launch of investment and recovery plans focused on the energy transition around the world have driven the demand for metals up sharply.\n\nAt the same time, metal supply, which is intrinsically inelastic and a/ff.ligaected by availability problems and logistical and transpo/r\\_t.liga bo/t\\_t.ligalenecks, has not managed to keep pace with the growth in demand, generating scarcity on the market with a consequently large increase in prices.\n\nFor copper and aluminum, after the highs reached during the year (over $10,000/ton in May for copper and around $3,000/ton in October for aluminum), prices appear to have stabilized during the last qua/r\\_t.ligaer, albeit at a high level, with less strained market fundamentals looking forward.\n\nSimilarly, after the peaks recorded in the 3rd Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2021, demand for steel has declined, re/fl.ligaecting both the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the environmental and energy limitations that have slowed down production at foundries in the Far East. All these factors paved the way for a substantial stabilization of prices in the /fi.liganal months of the year.\n\nFinally, as regards metals used in ba/t\\_t.ligaeries, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular nickel, lithium and cobalt, prices rose steadily throughout the year, driven by strained market fundamentals, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular demand from the electric vehicle and general energy sectors, which has not shown any signs of slowing down.\n\nPlease see the section 'Fighting climate change and ensuring environmental sustainability' for an analysis of the circular management of commodities linked to the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Climate change and long-term scenarios\n\nEnel promotes transparency in its climate-change disclosures and works to demonstrate to its stakeholders that it is tackling climate change with diligence and determination. Enel has publicly commi/t\\_t.ligaed to adopting the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board and to following all published updates. The Group is also taking on board the 'Guidelines on repo/r\\_t.ligaing climate-related information' published by the European Commission in June 2019, which, together with the TCFD recommendations and the GRI standard, constituted the main frame-\n\nwork for the Group's repo/r\\_t.ligaing on climate change issues in 2021. Enel has been involved in a working group to develop speci/fi.ligac recommendations to suppo/r\\_t.liga the implementation of the TCFD guidelines concerning scenario analysis. The TCFD Advisory Council worked on the scenarios in 2020 and, since then, Enel has been involved in various initiatives of scenario analysis, sharing our experience in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga the increasingly widespread and transparent implementation of this practice among a growing number of organizations.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nAnalysis of the evolving external conditions is a fundamental component of Enel's strategy. In today's complex world and faced with unce/r\\_t.ligaainty about the future, de/fi.liganing a solid and resilient strategy is crucial to the creation of value for all stakeholders. Therefore, Enel's strategic planning process begins with an analysis of the evolving external landscape, with a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular emphasis on climate change and the energy transition. To this end, the Group adopts a structured approach to scenario analysis in order to maximize oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and mitigate risks.\n\nScenario-based  planning  involves  de/fi.liganing  'alternative futures' based on a number of key unce/r\\_t.ligaainty variables, such as achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement or the development of technology. Compared with forecasting, scenario analysis provides greater /fl.ligaexibility and enables us to prepare for handling risks and seizing oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities. Forecasting, on the other hand, seeks to understand the future based on past trends, so it cannot anticipate changes, risks or signi/fi.ligacant unce/r\\_t.ligaainties.\n\nAt Enel, scenario analysis is used in planning, the allocation of capital, strategic positioning, and the assessment of risks and of strategy resilience. The preparation of scenarios helps companies to make strategic decisions under complex, unce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions by exploring plausible\n\nalternative futures, designing various paths forward with di/ff.ligaerent timing and options for mitigation, and conducting risk-based analyses in order to challenge our strategic thinking.\n\nIn 2021, the scenario framework was de/fi.liganed by way of a speci/fi.ligac workstream to suppo/r\\_t.liga the decision-making process ('strategic dialogue'). The topic was analyzed in dedicated workshops with senior management that focused on identifying the primary trends, disruptions, future unce/r\\_t.ligaainties and potential scenario narratives.\n\nWithin the scope of de/fi.liganing Enel's long-term scenarios, the mid- and long-term trends identi/fi.ligaed were then analyzed in depth, and the results of this analysis were summarized in an Industry View document for internal use. Designed to suppo/r\\_t.liga the decision-making process, this document provides an overview of the structural forces, macro-trends, potential disruptions, and technologies that have an impact on the development of the industry and the economy and describes the potential impact on the Company's business. As a result, it provides a framework for the de/fi.liganition of actions aimed at guiding, preventing, and adapting to changes in our various businesses, as well as at seizing related oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and developing a greater awareness of the risks involved.",

More speci/fi.ligacally, in the primary countries in which we have a presence and for which these models are available (i.e., Italy, Spain and Brazil at present), we have taken a bo/t\\_t.ligaom-up approach, imposing an explicit limit on the trend in CO 2 emissions for the country. The values of the scenario variables of relevance to the activities of the Group (including electricity demand, electri/fi.ligacation rates, renewable  and  distributed-generation  capacity,  the number of electric vehicles, and the production of green hydrogen) have been calculated by the model over a time horizon to 2050, in line with the limit on emissions and with a view to minimizing costs for the system. For the rest of the world, we have taken a top-down approach, such that the variables of interest have been calculated by way of analyses of consensus in relation to external scenarios aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement  as  provided  by  international  accredited  bodies. These two di/ff.ligaerent approaches have also been used to de/fi.ligane the alternative Slow Transition and Best Place scenarios at the local level.\n\nUnder  the Paris scenario,  European  countries  show  a downward trend in emissions consistent with the European 'Fit for 55' package thanks to a greater electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by an increasing contribution of renewables in the energy mix. More speci/fi.ligacally, the Paris scenario for Italy, which is more ambitious than the national plan currently in place, calls for an increase in electri/fi.ligacation to 28% by 2030 (vs. 22% in 2021) and a level of renewable energy generation that can meet 70% of electricity demand (vs. about 55% under the Italian national plan at the same date). Romania, too, sees an increase in the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption and in\n\nthe role of renewables in pursuing a more aggressive reduction in emissions compared with the current national plan. For Spain, the ambition level de/fi.liganed under the national plan is in line with achievement of the Paris Agreement objectives. As such, the Paris scenario calls for an electri/fi.ligacation rate of 29% by 2030 and development of renewables capacity that would bring the percentage of electricity demand met by renewable energy to over 80%. For Brazil, the Paris scenario has been de/fi.liganed based on the assumption of reaching the target of net-zero emissions by 2050. For the remaining countries of interest to the Group, the Paris scenario and the alternative scenarios have been de/fi.liganed based on a consensus analysis of the external scenarios available.\n\nThe Slow Transition scenario shows a lower ambition in combating climate change, which translates into a slower  development  of  renewables  and  slower  growth  in electri/fi.ligacation at all levels. This scenario has been constructed based on the assumption that countries will remain essentially tied to the current national plans, where these plans do not feature a climate ambition in line with achieving the Paris Agreement objectives, or that the ambition, if high, is not suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by adequate implementing policies. This la/t\\_t.ligaer case, for example, applies to Spain, which, under the Slow Transition scenario, fails to meet the ambition of the national plan due to delays in implementing policies that would enable a greater penetration of renewables and of other electricity technologies.\n\nThe Best Place scenario assumes a faster reduction in the cost of technologies to produce green hydrogen. This, then, translates into greater penetration of green hydrogen in the hard-to-abate sectors, at the expense of blue and gray hydrogen (i.e., gas-fueled hydrogen production with or without, respectively, the use of CCS technologies), resulting in an increase in electricity demand and in the installation of renewables capacity in the countries analyzed as compared with the Paris scenario.\n\nWith the help of fundamental system models, we have also been able to estimate the impact of energy e/ffi.ligaciency measures on both energy consumption and trends in electricity demand. We have also quanti/fi.ligaed the bene/fi.ligat of electri/fi.ligacation of the average household's energy consumption and transpo/r\\_t.ligaation in terms of lower energy bills and lower emissions. This analysis was done in relation to an average Enel customer, which showed a higher degree of electri/fi.ligacation than the national average for the country in question as a result of Enel's electri/fi.ligacation strategy. Finally, we have analyzed the impact of each scenario in terms of the reduction in overall consumption of fossil fuels and energy dependency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A number of countries are working to promote electric mobility in the region: Chile and Colombia, for example, have set speci/fi.ligac targets for electric mobility and their governments are implementing clear policies to promote growth in this market.

These scenarios are associated with emission pa/t\\_t.ligaerns linked to a level of the Representative Concentration Pathway, each of which is connected to one of the /fi.ligave scenarios de/fi.liganed by the scientific community as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The SSP scenarios include general assumptions concerning population, urbanization, etc. The three physical scenarios analyzed by the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 SSP2-RCP 4.5: compatible with an intermediate scenario that calls for an average temperature increase of about 2.7 \u00b0C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. The RCP 4.5 scenario is the one that is most representative\n- \u00b7 SSP1-RCP 2.6: compatible with a range of global warming below 2 \u00b0C from pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) by 2100 (the IPCC forecasts an average of about +1.8 \u00b0C from 1850-1900 with a 44% likelihood of staying below 1.5 \u00b0C and 78% of staying below +2 \u00b0C (11) ); in the analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP1-RCP 2.6 scenario with the Paris and Best Place scenarios.\n\nof the world's current climate and political landscape and  correlated  transition  assumptions.  This  scenario forecasts global warming in line with the estimates of temperature increases that consider current policy around the world; (12) in the analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario with the Slow Transition scenario.\n\n- \u00b7 SSP5-RCP  8.5:  compatible  with  a  scenario  where  no pa/r\\_t.ligaicular measures to combat climate change are implemented. This scenario forecasts an increase in global temperatures of about +4.4 \u00b0C from pre-industrial levels by 2100 (de/fi.liganitely above 3 \u00b0C and with a 62% likelihood of being above 4 \u00b0C according to IPCC estimates).\n\nThe Group considers the RCP 8.5 scenario to a worstcase climate scenario used to assess the e/ff.ligaects of physical phenomena in a context of pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly signi/fi.ligacant climate change, but it is currently deemed not to be very likely.

For the description of speci/fi.ligac, complex events, the Group considers data and analyses of public bodies, universities, and private-sector entities.\n\nThe climate scenarios are global and must be analyzed at the local level in order to determine their impact in the areas of relevance to the Group.

As pa/r\\_t.liga of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the major climate variables with a grid resolution of varying from about 12 km to 100 km and a forecast horizon running from 2020 to 2050. The main variables are temperature, rain and snowfall, and solar radiation. Compared with past analyses, current studies are based on the use of multiple regional climate models: the one of the ICTP along with /fi.ligave other simulations, which have been selected as being representative of the set of climate models currently available in the literature. The output of this set is representative of the average of the various climate models.

In the same way, the Group is also analyzing data related to climate projections for No/r\\_t.ligah America.\n\nThe ICTP is also providing science suppo/r\\_t.liga to interpret all other climate data we gather. We are using climate scenarios for the countries of interest to the Group to allow for a homogeneous assessment of climate risk.\n\nSome of these phenomena entail high levels of complexity, as they depend not only on climate trends but also on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the territory and require fu/r\\_t.ligaher modeling to obtain a high-resolution representation. For this reason, in addition to the climate scenarios provided by ICTP, the Group also uses natural hazard maps. This tool makes it possible to obtain, with a high spatial resolution, recurrence intervals for a series of events, such as storms, hurricanes and /fl.ligaoods. As described in the section 'Risks and strategic oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with climate change', these maps are widely used within the Group, which already uses historical data to optimize insurance strategies. In addition, work is under way to be able to take advantage of this information developed in accordance with climate scenario projections.\n\nFinally, the Group has acquired the tools and capabilities needed to autonomously gather and analyze the raw output published by the scienti/fi.ligac community, so as to have a global, high-level view of the long-term trends in the climate variables of interest to us. These sources include the output from the climate and regional models CMIP6 (13) and  CORDEX (14) .  CMIP6  is  the  sixth  assessment  of  the Coupled  Model  Intercomparison  Project  (CMIP),  which is a project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and of the Working Group of Coupled Modelling (WGCM), which provides raw climate data from global climate models. These are used to assess standard global measurements at a resolution of about 100x100 km. The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) also falls within the scope of the WCRP and generates regional climate forecasts at a higher resolution.\n\n## Physical scenario analysis - Integration of climate scenarios within the Open Country Risk model\n\nIn addition to using high-resolution data to analyze the impact of physical phenomena, the Group has also designed a higher-level analysis framework that enables us to obtain a country-level assessment of trends in certain global climate hazards in a manner that is consistent across all regions. More speci/fi.ligacally, we have adopted a modular approach that will enable us to progressively upgrade our analyses by including new physical phenomena and re/fi.liganing both the data and our methodologies. At present, four climate phenomena are included: two related to extreme temperatures; one related to intense rainfall; and one related to drought. The phenomena are assigned a numerical index based on the global distribution to a resolution of about 100x100 km and are summarized in a composite index. This has enabled us to include a dimension related to climate change in the Open Country Risk model. This enables the tool to include both the aspects considered by the Country Risk models and those aspects related to the physical risks considered in the model as a cause of environmental and economic stress in a given country. The Open Country Risk model is described in greater detail in the section 'Macroeconomic and geopolitical trends'.\n\n## Physical scenario analysis - Italy\n\nAcute phenomena: for Italy, we /fi.ligarst analyzed the phenomenon of acute rainfall to study the change in daily rainfall  above  the  ninety-/fi.ligafth  percentile,  calculated  as average millimeters per year for the periods of analysis. As shown in the left-hand /fi.ligagure below, comparing 20302050 with the historical period 1990-2020, under the RCP 2.6 scenario, intense rainfall is forecast to increase, above all, in the no/r\\_t.ligaheast and signi/fi.ligacantly along the Tyrrhenian coastline. It is interesting to note that, under the RCP 2.6 scenario, this general increase in extreme rainfall is accompanied by a slight decrease in the annual total of daily rainfall excluding the acute phenomena (see right-hand /fi.ligagure). Under the other scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), too, we see the same dichotomy between intense and average rainfall.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This change mainly impacts the islands and southern Italy, where the increase in highrisk days goes from about +6 to +8 days compared with historical values.\n\nChronic phenomena: chronic temperature changes can be analyzed to obtain information about the potential effects on the cooling and heating demand of local energy systems. As was done in 2020, to measure the thermal requirement  are  Heating  Degree  Days  (HDDs),  i.e.,  the sum, for all days of the year with a T average \u2264 15 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences between the internal temperature (with T internal assumed to be 18 \u00b0C) and the average temperature, and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), i.e., the sum, for all days of the year with T average \u2265 24 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences between the T average and the T internal (assumed to be 21 \u00b0C), respectively, for heating and cooling requirements. The analysis for Italy has been re/fi.liganed both by increasing the number of models considered, from 3 to 6, and by increasing data resolution, from about 50x50 km to 12x12 km. The country averages have been calculated as an average over the\n\ncountry, weighting each geographical node by population thanks to the use of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) associated with each RCP scenario. In 2030-2050, the heating requirement is expected to decrease from 7% to 15% compared with 2000-2020 under the various scenarios, while CDDs are always greater than historical data, with an increasing trend going from the RCP 2.6 scenario (~+50%) to RPC 8.5 (~+100%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Heating Degree Days (HDD)\n- Cooling Degree Days (CDD)\n\nWith regard to rainfall, changes in the areas of interest for the Group's hydroelectric power generation have been analyzed.

To have a holistic view of the entire continent and identify the areas of greatest interest for our studies, we have analyzed a number of acute phe-\n\nnomena using standard indicators. The analyses have been based on data from a set of 6 climate models at a spatial resolution of 25x25 km.\n\nIn order to study the phenomenon of extreme temperatures, we have used the Warm Spell Duration Index (WSDI), which considers heat waves of at least 6 consecutive days with an average daily high above the ninetieth percentile. Comparing 2030-2050 with 1990-2020, the /fi.ligagures point to a signi/fi.ligacant increase in heat waves even under the RCP 2.6 scenario, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly in ce/r\\_t.ligaain areas of Brazil, in Colombia, in Peru, and in no/r\\_t.ligahern Chile.

Future changes in this phenomenon vary to a greater degree. Under the RCP 2.6 scenario, ce/r\\_t.ligaain areas, such as no/r\\_t.ligahern Brazil and no/r\\_t.ligahern Argentina, are expected to see declines, whereas other areas, such as western Colombia and ce/r\\_t.ligaain areas of Brazil and Peru, are expected to see increases in extreme rainfall.\n\nChronic  phenomena:  for  the  major  countries  in  which we have a presence, we studied the potential changes in heating and cooling needs related to chronic temperature changes. Here, too, we calculated the changes in Heating Degree Days (HDDs) and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) for 2030-2050 compared with 1990-2020 based on data from 6 models at a resolution of 25x25 km. The country\n\naverages  have  been  calculated  as  an  average  over  the country, weighting each geographical node by population using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) associated with each RCP scenario.

Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the increases become 108% in Chile and just over 25% for Argentina, Brazil and Peru, se/t\\_t.ligaling at 20% for Colombia.

Initial analyses, which compare 2030-2050 forecasts under the three scenarios with the historical period 1990-2009, show a prevalent downward trend in chronic rainfall. The most signi/fi.ligacant average reductions are expected to be seen in Chile and Colombia, at just under\n\n10%. A closer look at the averages for Chile shows that, in the areas considered, the expected rainfall for 2030-2050 is in line with the rainfall experienced over the last decade (2010-2019). These /fi.ligagures show how, in these areas, we are already seeing climate change compared with the historical period used as a benchmark.\n\n## Overall e/ff.ligaect of the transition and physical scenarios on electricity demand\n\n## Italy and Spain\n\nThe  use  of  integrated  energy  system  models  makes  it possible to quantify the individual service demand of a country. This level of detail therefore makes it possible to discriminate the speci/fi.ligac e/ff.ligaects that a change in temperature can have on energy requirements. For this purpose, the Paris , Slow Transition , and Best Place transition scenarios described above have been expanded to include the e/ff.ligaect that temperature increases, measured in terms of Heating Degree Days (HDDs) and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) as discussed above, have on (total, not just electricity) energy demand for residential and commercial heating and cooling. By de/fi.liganing a strategic base scenario in line with achieving the Paris objectives and with Europe's\n\ncommitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (15) we were able to associate HDDs and CDDs consistent with the RCP 2.6 scenario with the Paris and Best Place scenarios, while those that are consistent with the RCP 4.5 scenario are associated with the Slow Transition scenario. For further stress testing, this la/t\\_t.ligaer scenario was also associated with the RCP 8.5 scenario. Given current policy and the European Union's keen focus on achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, all three scenarios (i.e., Paris , Slow Transition , and Best Place ) for Italy and Spain converge on this result. However, the Slow Transition scenario, as speci/fi.ligaed above, is associated with a di/ff.ligaerent, higher RCP because it corresponds to a slower downward trend in greenhouse gas emissions.

In turn, as mentioned, the crucial role that green hydrogen will play under the Best Place scenario is expected to lead to electricity demand far above the Paris scenario, of 19% for Italy and 15% for Spain.\n\nSimilarly to the previous year, the speed of the energy transition has had a much greater impact on electricity demand than the increase in temperature as a result of climate change. Decarbonization policies, together with technological  innovation,  social  responsibility,  and  consequent changes in consumer behavior, will play an active role in trends in electricity demand and in the energy mix generally. However, analysis makes it clear that an increase\n\nin temperature as a result of climate change will lead to an increase in electricity demand, even if limited within a range of one percentage point for both Italy and Spain.\n\nConsidering the integrated view, the potential e/ff.ligaect of more ambitious transition scenarios has a more signi/fi.ligacant impact on electricity demand than the increase in temperature resulting from climate change.\n\nAlthough the trends in degree days (both HDDs and CDDs) are similar, the percentage di/ff.ligaerences in electricity demand in Spain for the three scenarios are lower than in Italy. The essential di/ff.ligaerence concerns the energy system by 2030, for which Spain's existing national energy plan is already very ambitious and in line with RCP 2.6, meaning that the Slow Transition scenario is closer to the Paris scenario. Therefore, we expect less volatility in energy system trends\n\nand in electricity demand over the 2031-2050 period.\n\n## Italy - Average impact on electricity demand (2031-2050) of the three transition scenarios paired with RCP 2.6 and 4.5\n\nParis RCP 2.6 to Slow Transition RCP 4.5\n\nParis RCP 2.6 to Best Place RCP 2.6\n\n<!-- image -->",

The same considerations can also be extended to the other countries in which the Group is present. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in the rest of South America, where we again observe the positive elasticity of electricity demand to temperatures, the expected rise in temperature would still have less impact than economic growth. In fact, in Chile and Colombia, historical evidence still shows a strong coupling between the growth of electricity demand and GDP growth, with demand from the industrial sector accounting for around 50% of electricity consumption. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the variability of the macroeconomic context could have repercussions on the electri/fi.ligacation of the residential and service sectors, which represent the most immediate drivers of the increase in electricity demand in the event of an increase in temperatures.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  main  temperature e/ff.ligaects in the South American countries, with ranges obtained by applying a 95% con/fi.ligadence interval to our baseline case.\n\n|           | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   |    |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----|\n| Country   | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 4.5                     | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 4.5                     | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5                     | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5                     |    |\n|           | TWh                                         | %                                           | TWh                                         | %                                           |    |\n| Argentina | 0.68                                        | 0.3                                         | 1.37                                        | 0.6                                         |    |\n| Brazil    | 7. 9 2                                      | 0.8                                         | 15.83                                       | 1.5                                         |    |\n| Chile     | 0.05                                        | 0.0                                         | 0.10                                        | 0.1                                         |    |\n| Colombia  | 0.08                                        | 0.1                                         | 0. 17                                       | 0.1                                         |    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|           | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   | Temperature e/ff.ligaect (annual average)   |    |\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----|\n| Country   | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 4.5                     | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 4.5                     | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5                     | from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5                     |    |\n|           | TWh                                         | %                                           | TWh                                         | %                                           |    |\n| Argentina | 0.57                                        | 0.3                                         | 1.15                                        | 0.5                                         |    |\n| Brazil    | 2.48                                        | 0                                           | 4.96                                        | 0                                           |    |\n| Chile     | 0.01                                        | 0.0                                         | 0.01                                        | 0.0                                         |    |\n| Colombia  | 0.02                                        | 0.0                                         | 0.05                                        | 0.0                                         |    |\n\n## Upper bound\n\n## Lower bound\n\nE/ff.ligaect of the variation in temperature on electricity demand in the main Latin American countries in which the Group operates (average 2030-2050).",

        "page_content": "## Assessment of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with the Strategic Plan\n\nThe process of de/fi.liganing the Group's strategies is accompanied by a careful analysis of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with those strategies.\n\nIdentifying those risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities within the Enel Group's strategic and industrial planning process is designed to span the horizon of the Plan in an integrated manner.\n\nAlthough the strategy underlying the Plan, as described above, envisages a phase of careful analysis and veri/fi.ligacation of the strategic risk factors and variables, it retains scenario assumptions regarding future events that will not necessarily occur, as they depend on variables that cannot be controlled by management. Upside and downside developments may occur as time unfolds.\n\nBefore being able to approve the Strategic Plan, a quantitative analysis of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with the Group's strategic positioning is presented annually to the Control and Risk Commi/t\\_t.ligaee appointed by the Board of Directors. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, risk factors such as macroeconomic and energy variables (such as exchange rates, in/fl.ligaation, commodity prices and electricity demand), regulatory developments, weather and climate events and risks connected with the competition are identi/fi.ligaed.\n\nBased on the nature of the risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity drivers, the analytical approach that best represents their volatility is selected. In practice, we pe/r\\_f.ligaorm scenario analysis for all those variables whose market time series provide a robust foundation to estimate levels of correlation and representative volatility for future risk, and a deterministic analysis based on what-ifs of the possible evolution of the business with respect to the main risk factors for the execution of the Business Plan.\n\nThe validity of the results is also monitored with ex-post analyses by risk cluster. In 2021, most of the actual upside and downside events fell well within the limits estimated by the risk models of the Strategic Plan presented at the end of 2020.\n\nFocusing on the scenario risk analysis for the Strategic Plan, exchange rates, electricity demand and the volatility of energy and commodity prices represent almost all the volatility of the drivers. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in addition to the US dollar the most impacting currencies are the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso and the Brazilian real. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, the Group's very structure ensures that the volatility of the South American currencies has only a negligible impact on pro/fi.ligats. Italy and Spain represent nearly all of the Group's exposure to the impact of the volatility of energy prices and commodity price /fl.ligauctuations on margins.\n\nExamining the other risk factors, such as those connected with weather and climate events, we can see that geographical diversi/fi.ligacation signi/fi.ligacantly reduces the exposure to the risk associated with renewable resources - a highly positive factor considering the Group's positioning and the steady expansion of renewable generation. Furthermore, with regard to climate change, the risk associated with 'acute' events is managed as pa/r\\_t.liga of investment for adaptation to climate change and the Group's insurance strategy.\n\nWith regard to risk factors estimated deterministically, the\n\nmonitoring of all possible regulatory issues is crucial for assessing any upside or downside impact on the Group. In general, correlations between all the risk factors create diversi/fi.ligacation e/ff.ligaects that substantially mitigate total ex-\n\nposures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It strengthens the Group's awareness of its risk pro/fi.ligale, identifying any oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities it may o/ff.ligaer.\n\nThis system is the set of rules, procedures, and organizational structures developed to identify, measure, monitor and manage the main risks to which the Group is exposed. The internal control and risk management system makes it possible to comprehensively de/fi.ligane - for each risk and with an integrated approach - the risk strategy, appropri-\n\nate management and control arrangements, the development and updating of metrics, risk measurement models and risk limits.\n\nWith regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken in recent years by the Group to increase its resilience to such a development can leverage our sound /fi.liganancial position, geographical diversi/fi.ligacation and integrated business model  to  mitigate  and  address  unforeseen  events  and their potential e/ff.ligaects with mitigation actions and contingency plans.",

Enel has adopted a quantitative Open Country Risk assessment model capable of speci/fi.ligacally monitoring the riskiness of the countries in which it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpen Country Risk is a quantitative model that extends the more conventional de/fi.liganition of country risk used in the existing literature by providing a more complete analysis of the risks involved, incorporating economic, /fi.liganancial, political, climate and energy factors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Open Country Risk model seeks to go beyond the more conventional de/fi.liganition of country risk, which focuses on the ability of a government to repay the debt it has issued, to o/ff.ligaer a broader view of the risk factors that can impact a country. The model is divided into four risk components: economic; institutional and political; social; and energy factors.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the Open Country Risk model has the ambition to measure the economic resilience of individual countries, de/fi.liganed as the balance of their position with respect to the rest of the world, the e/ff.ligaectiveness of internal policies, the vulnerabilities of their banking and corporate system that might po/r\\_t.ligaend systemic crises and their attractiveness in terms of economic growth, and /fi.liganally a quanti/fi.ligacation of extreme climate events as a cause of stress at the environmental and economic level (economic factors). This is accompanied by an assessment of the robustness of the country's institutions and the political context  (institutional  and  political  factors),  an  in-depth analysis  of  social  phenomena,  measuring  the  level  of well-being, inclusion and social progress (social factors), and the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the energy system and its positioning within the energy-transition process, as these are all essential factors for evaluating the sustainability of investments in the medium to long term (energy factors). Speci/fi.ligacally, the introduction of extreme climate events within the Open Country Risk model makes it possible to develop a uniform assessment on the evolution of ce/r\\_t.ligaain climate hazards at the country level on a global scale. More information on climate scenarios and the framework used within the Open Country Risk model is discussed in the section 'Risks and strategic oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with climate change'.\n\nFinally, with regard to the analysis of the energy-transition process, the Open Country Risk model also includes risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity analyses designed for forecasting purposes, quantifying the actions and the paths taken by the individual countries. For example, the model incorporates various factors re/fl.ligaecting the weight of renewable sources in energy generation, the electri/fi.ligacation process and the environmental sustainability of the national energy system, which together are crucial characteristics for evaluating the country's potential growth and a/t\\_t.ligaractiveness in the medium to long term.\n\nIn order to mitigate this risk, the model suppo/r\\_t.ligas the capital  allocation  and  investment  evaluation  processes.  To fu/r\\_t.ligaher suppo/r\\_t.liga the investment evaluation process, Enel has adopted a methodology called 'Total Societal Impact' that, adopting an integrated approach based on advanced economic models, clearly and robustly expresses the direct, indirect and induced impacts of investment initia-\n\ntives at the national, regional or local levels. By quantifying standard international metrics, Total Societal Impact covers a wide range of economic, social and environmental indicators that play a strategic role in correctly assessing the social and environmental contribution of Enel's projects. In fact, considering some of the indicators that can be analyzed, such as the contribution to GDP, the increase in income of the weakest social groups, the calculation of carbon dioxide emissions avoided and the recovery of end-of-life materials from a circular economy perspective, it is clearly now essential to have a broad overview of the situation in order to evaluate a speci/fi.ligac project in a given country with a view to creating shared value for all.\n\nThe year 2021 was the second year in a row in which the world had to face the COVID-19 health crisis. However, the economies of many mature and developing countries experienced a signi/fi.ligacant recovery last year after the sharp decline in 2020, with estimated global GDP growth of around 5.8% year-on-year in 2021. This progress was mainly achieved thanks to high vaccination rates (although there remain considerable disparities in vaccination coverage between high and low-income countries) and to the expansionary /fi.ligascal and monetary policies adopted by governments and central banks.\n\nRecent data show that the growth outlook for 2022 is less optimistic, with the pace of expansion set to slow compared with the previous year, with global annual GDP growth projected to be around 4%. This would be a/t\\_t.ligaributable to possible factors such as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases triggered by the spread of new variants around the world, continuing in/fl.ligaationary pressures with rising food and energy prices, which could cause in/fl.ligaation expectations to de-anchor from the targets pursued by central banks, and new supply interruptions.\n\nFinally, a range of economic and socio-political risk factors needs to be carefully monitored in Latin America as well. For example, a worsening of the pandemic caused by the spread of new variants could place a greater strain on healthcare systems in the countries of the area. Central banks in the area have been among the most reactive in raising interest rates in response to high levels of in/fl.ligaation, and could also continue to adopt such restrictive strategies in 2022, representing a downside risk to the economic recovery. Finally, other risks are connected with the high levels of public debt accumulated by governments in these two years of the pandemic, and with political uncertainty associated with elections in Brazil and Colombia or the potentially overly radical political agenda that might be pursued by the new President of Chile, Gabriel Boric.",

The framework described has been created with a view to ensuring overall consistency, making it possible to analyze and evaluate the impact of physical and transition phenomena within solid alternative scenarios, constructed using a quantitative and modeling approach combined with ongoing dialogue with both internal stakeholders and external authorities.\n\nPhysical risks are divided in turn between acute (i.e., extreme events) and chronic, with the former linked to extremely intense meteorological conditions and the la/t\\_t.ligaer to more gradual but structural changes in climate conditions. Extreme events expose the Group to the risk of prolonged unavailability of assets and infrastructure, the cost of restoring service, customer disruptions and so on. Chronic\n\nchanges in climate conditions expose the Group to other risks or oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: for example, structural changes in temperature could cause changes in electricity demand and have an impact on output, while alterations in rainfall or wind conditions could impact the Group's business by increasing or decreasing potential electricity generation.\n\nThe energy transition towards a more sustainable model characterized by a gradual reduction of CO 2 emissions has risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected both with changes in the regulatory and legal context and trends in technology development and competition, electri/fi.ligacation and the consequent market developments.\n\nConsistent with the climate and transition scenarios used by Enel to determine risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, the main transition-related phenomena are beginning to emerge in relation to customer behavior, industrial strategies being adopted in all economic sectors and regulatory policies. By 2030, the transition trends will become visible in response to the evolution of the context: the Enel Group has decided to guide and facilitate the transition, preparing to seize all the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities that may arise. As discussed previously, our strategic choices, which are already strongly oriented towards the energy transition, with more than 90% of investments directed at improving a number of the Sustainable Development Goals, enable us to incorporate risk mitigation and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity maximization 'by design', adopting a positioning that takes account of the medium- and long-term phenomena we have identi/fi.ligaed. The strategic choices are accompanied by the operating best practices adopted by the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The above activities are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed on the foundation of an ongoing e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga during the year to analyze, assess and manage the information produced. As declared by the TCFD, the process of disclosing information on the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with climate change will be gradual and incremental from year to year.\n\n## Enel's resilience to the energy transition and climate change\n\nThe impacts of climate change, technological evolution, the evolution of policies and changes in macroeconomic fundamentals make it ever more impo/r\\_t.ligaant to develop resilient  business  strategies,  i.e.,  strategies  capable  of withstanding external shocks, and therefore of absorbing the causes of potential crises and thriving even when external conditions change, whether slowly or rapidly. Jointly considering the factors associated with energy-transition scenarios  and  the  various  climate  change  scenarios  is therefore a prerequisite for long-term planning.\n\nThe set of transition and climatic scenarios plays a role in guiding strategic and industrial decisions, taking account, for example, of the future e/ff.ligaects of temperature on electricity demand, the investments necessary to suppo/r\\_t.liga the process of ever greater electri/fi.ligacation and decarbonization, the evolution of the market environment and of consumer habits. Given that Enel's Strategic Plan concentrates more than 94% of investment on combatting climate change through the progressive expansion of generation from renewable sources and the development of infrastructure and services to guide energy systems and customers towards progressive electri/fi.ligacation, while at the same time signi/fi.ligacant reducing the use of fossil fuels, the Group's investments and activities delineate, by design, a long-term growth path that is in line with an energy transition consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe application of long-term climate scenarios enables the construction of adaptation plans for the Group's asset and business po/r\\_t.ligafolio. Climate scenarios are developed sta/r\\_t.ligaing with the identi/fi.ligacation of the most relevant physical phenomena for each business (such as heat waves, extreme rainfall, /fi.ligare risk, etc.), to produce analyses that provide  both  high-level  indicators  (such  as  comparable country risk indices) and high-resolution data, which make it possible to study physical hazards at the single-site level. The approach applies to both the existing po/r\\_t.ligafolio and new investments. Asset vulnerability assessment makes it possible to identify priority actions to increase resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Of course, such stress testing has an extremely low probability of occurrence based on historical events and geographical diversi/fi.ligacation. The variables examined\n\nare electricity demand (+/-1% per year), whose variations can potentially impact the generation and retail businesses. It was stress tested for all countries in which the Group operates. The output potential of renewable plants was also stressed (+/-10% over a single year). Variations in this variable can potentially impact the generation business. It was stressed separately at the individual technology level around the globe. The data repo/r\\_t.ligaed show the e/ff.ligaect on a single year for a single generation technology and include both the volume and price e/ff.ligaects.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(16) Through its insurance business units and the captive insurance company Enel Insurance NV, the Group manages the various phases of assessing the risks connected with natural disasters: from assessment and quanti/fi.ligacation to the corresponding insurance coverage to minimize impacts.\n\nThe methodology is applicable to all extreme events that can be analyzed, such as wind storms, heat waves, tropical cyclones, /fl.ligaooding, etc. In all of these types of natural disaster, three independent factors can be identi/fi.ligaed, as brie/fl.ligay described below.\n\n- \u00b7 The event probability (hazard), i.e., the theoretical frequency of the event over a speci/fi.ligac time frame: the recurrence interval. In other words, a catastrophic event that has, for example, a recurrence interval of 250 years has a probability of occurrence in any given year of 0.4%. This information, which is necessary for assessing the level of frequency of the event, is then associated with the geographical distribution of Group assets.\n\nFor this purpose, the Group adopts the hazard map tool, which associates the estimated frequency associated with an extreme event, for the di/ff.ligaerent types of natural disasters, with each geographical point of the global map. This information, organized in geo-referenced databases, can be obtained from global reinsurance companies, weather consulting /fi.ligarms or academic institutions.\n\n- \u00b7 Vulnerability, which indicates in percentage terms how much value would be lost upon the occurrence of a giv-\n\n catastrophic event. In more speci/fi.ligac terms, reference can be made to the damage to material assets, the impact on the continuity of electricity generation and/or distribution or the provision of electrical services to end users.\n\nThe Group, especially in the case of damage to its assets, conducts and promotes speci/fi.ligac vulnerability analyses for each technology in its po/r\\_t.ligafolio: solar, wind and hydroelectric generation plants, transmission and distribution grids, primary and secondary substations, etc. These analyses are naturally focused on the extreme events that most impact the di/ff.ligaerent types of technologies. This produces a so/r\\_t.liga of matrix that associates the signi/fi.ligacantly impacted type of asset with the individual natural catastrophic events.\n\n- \u00b7 Exposure is the set of economic values present in the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio that could be materially impacted in the presence of catastrophic natural events. Again, the dimensions of the analyses are speci/fi.ligac for the di/ff.ligaerent production technologies, distribution assets and services to end users.\n\nThe three factors described above (hazard, vulnerability and exposure) constitute the fundamental elements of any assessment of the risk associated with extreme events. In this sense, the Group, with respect to climate change scenarios, di/ff.ligaerentiates its risk analyses in accordance with the speci/fi.ligacities of the various associated time horizons. The following table summarizes the scheme adopted for the assessment of the impacts deriving from acute physical phenomena.\n\n| Time horizon                    | Hazard                                                                                             | Vulnerability                                                                                                                               | Exposure                              |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Sho/r\\_t.liga term (1-3 years)   | Hazard maps based on historical  data and meteorological models                                    | Vulnerability, being linked to the  type of extreme event, to the  speci/fi.ligacs of the type of damage  and to the technical requirements | Group values in the sho/r\\_t.liga term |\n| Long term (to 2050 and/or 2100) | Hazard maps and speci/fi.ligac studies  for the di/ff.ligaerent RCP climate  scenarios of the IPCC | of the technology in question, is  essentially independent of time  horizons                                                                | Group values in the long term         |",

Two main types of action can be distinguished: obtaining e/ff.ligaective insurance coverage and climate adaptation activities, preventing losses that could be caused by extreme events.\n\nThe general characteristics of these actions are illustrated below and, naturally, in the case of adaptation activities for damage prevention and mitigation, speci/fi.ligac reference will be made to the Group's Generation and Infrastructure and Networks Global Business Lines.\n\n## Impact of acute physical events on the Group\n\nThe Enel Group has a well-diversi/fi.ligaed po/r\\_t.ligafolio in terms of its generation technologies, geographical distribution and asset scale and, consequently, the po/r\\_t.ligafolio's exposure to natural risks is also diversi/fi.ligaed. The Group implements various risk mitigation measures, which, as described below, include both insurance coverage and other management and operational arrangements to fu/r\\_t.ligaher lower the Company's risk pro/fi.ligale.\n\nThe empirical evidence indicates negligible repercussions from these risks, as shown by the data for the last /fi.ligave years. Considering the most signi/fi.ligacant events, de/fi.liganed as events with a gross impact of more than \u20ac10 million, the cumulative gross impact amounts to about \u20ac270 million, which represents less than 0.14% of the value of the Group's insured assets as at 2022 (about \u20ac202 billion), most of which was recovered through insurance reimbursements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Insurance in the Enel Group\n\nEach year, the Group develops global insurance programs for its businesses in the various countries in which it operates. The two main programs, in terms of coverage and volumes, are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Liability  Program,  which  insures  against  losses caused to third pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including the impact that extreme events may have on the Group's assets and business.\n- \u00b7 the Prope/r\\_t.ligay Program for material damage to assets and the resulting business interruption. Accordingly, in addition to the costs of rebuilding assets (or pa/r\\_t.ligas thereof), the /fi.liganancial losses due to the stoppage of electricity generation and/or distribution are also covered, within the limits and conditions de/fi.liganed in the policies;\n\nBased on e/ff.ligaective risk assessment, it is possible to specify appropriate limits and insurance conditions within the policies, and this also applies in the case of extreme natural events linked to climate change. In fact, in the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the impacts on the business can be signi/fi.ligacant but, as has happened in the past in various locations around the world, the Group has demonstrated a high degree of resilience, thanks to the ample insurance coverage limits, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the Group's solid reinsurance capabilities through the captive company Enel Insurance NV.\n\nThe presence of this e/ff.ligaective insurance coverage does not make the actions that the Group takes in the preventive maintenance of its generation and distribution assets any less impo/r\\_t.ligaant. In fact, while on the one hand the effects of these activities are immediately re/fl.ligaected in the mitigation of the impacts of extreme events, on the other hand they are a necessary prerequisite for optimizing risk /fi.liganancing and minimizing the cost of the Group's global insurance coverage programs, including the risk associated with catastrophic natural events. This adaptive strategy takes the form of management strategies and actions that go beyond insurance alone and change with the surrounding conditions. For example, the Group has managed to sterilize much of the strong upward trend in premiums on the insurance markets through changes to its risk retention policies for assets, as well as through internal risk transfer policies that reward the Business Lines that are most vi/r\\_t.ligauous in terms of risk mitigation. From this perspective, the method and the information\n\nextracted from the ex-post analysis of events play a crucial role in determining the processes and practices to be deployed in mitigating such events in the future.\n\n## Climate change adaptation in the Enel Group\n\nThe Group implements adaptation solutions for weather and climate events in order to e/ff.ligaectively manage the chronic and acute phenomena a/ff.ligaecting each activity and Business Line.\n\nThe adaptation solutions can involve both sho/r\\_t.liga-term and long-term actions, such as planning investments in response to climate phenomena. Adaptation activities also include the implementation of procedures, policies and best practices.\n\nFor new investments, it is also possible to take advance action in the design and construction phase to reduce the  impact  of  climate  risks  by  design  (for  example, through risk and vulnerability assessment in the design phase) and to take account of any chronic e/ff.ligaects (e.g., the inclusion of climate scenarios in long-term renewable resource estimates).\n\nOnce the relevant weather and climate phenomena have been identi/fi.ligaed, the activities implemented to maximize adaptability can be classi/fi.ligaed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 enhancing asset resilience: measures to increase the resilience of assets, such as the quantitative assessment of potential acute and chronic risks to be/t\\_t.ligaer de/fi.ligane requirements in the design phase and actions to be implemented for existing assets.\n- \u00b7 adverse  event  prevention  and  management:  procedures  for  advanced  preparation  for  extreme  events (for example, acquiring sho/r\\_t.liga-term forecast weather data and training) and procedures for restoring normal operations as quickly as possible (for example, the de/fi.liganition  of  operational  and  organizational  procedures to be activated in response to critical events);\n\nThe following table provides a high-level summary of the type of actions that Enel implements to e/ff.ligaectively manage adverse events and to increase resilience to weather phenomena and their evolution due to climate change. In the following sections, ce/r\\_t.ligaain activities are described in greater detail.",

Measures implemented for speci/fi.ligac sites in recent years include:\n\n- \u00b7 installing fogging systems to improve the /fl.ligaow of inlet air and o/ff.ligaset the reduction in power output caused by the increase in ambient temperature in CCGTs;\n- \u00b7 improving cooling water management systems for certain plants in order to counter the problems caused by the decline in water levels on rivers, such as the Po in Italy;\n\nGroup practices for managing weather events in generation operations\n\n## Main areas:\n\nMaintenance\n\nO&M Operation\n\n- \u00b7 installing drainage pumps, raising embankments, periodic cleaning of canals and interventions to consolidate land adjacent to plants to prevent landslides in order to mitigate /fl.ligaood risks;\n- \u00b7 periodic site-speci/fi.ligac reassessments for hydro plants of /fl.ligaood scenarios using numerical simulations. The scenarios developed are managed with mitigation actions and interventions for civil works, dams and water inlets.\n\nThe Group adopts a series of best practices to manage the impact of weather events on power generation, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 weather forecasting both to monitor renewable resource availability and detect extreme events, with warning systems to ensure the protection of people and assets;\n- \u00b7 hydrological simulations, land surveys (including with the use of drones), monitoring any vulnerabilities through digital GISs (Geographic Information Systems) and satellite measurements; \u00b7 advanced monitoring of over 100,000 parameters (with over 160 million historical measure-\n\nments) for dams and hydroelectric works;\n\n- \u00b7 safe rooms in plants in areas exposed to tornadoes and hurricanes, such as the wind farms in Oklahoma in the United States;\n- \u00b7 real-time remote monitoring of generation plants;\n- \u00b7 adoption of speci/fi.ligac guidelines for pe/r\\_f.ligaorming hydrological and hydraulic studies from the earliest development stages, aimed at assessing the risks inside plants and in the areas outside plants, with application in the design phase of drainage and mitigation systems in compliance with the principle of hydraulic invariance;\n- \u00b7 veri/fi.ligacation of potential climate trends for the main project parameters in order to take them into account in the sizing of systems for relevant projects (for example, assessments of the temperature of the coolant source in order to ensure greater /fl.ligaexibility in cooling in new CCGTs)\n\n<!-- image -->",

One solution to minimize the impacts of climate phenomena is represented by the lessons-learned feedback process, which is implemented by the technical functions. It is governed by the existing operating model and in/fl.ligauences future projects.\n\n## Adaptation measures - Infrastructure and Networks\n\nIn the Infrastructure and Networks Business Line, the Enel Group has adopted an approach in recent years called '4R' to cope with extreme climate events. A speci/fi.ligac policy (which seeks to implement an innovative strategy to ensure the resilience of the distribution grid) has been developed to de/fi.ligane the measures to be taken both in preparation for an emergency within the network and for the prompt restoration of service once climate events have caused damage to assets and/or outages. The 4R strategy is divided into four phases.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk prevention: this includes actions that make it possible to reduce the probability of losing network com-\n\nGuidelines for Readiness Response and Recovery actions during emergencies\n\nGuideline for Network Resilience Enhancement Plan\n\n- and civil engineering works (for example, rainfall assessments for designs of drainage systems at solar plants);\n- ponents because of an event and/or to minimize its e/ff.ligaects, i.e., interventions aimed both at increasing the robustness of the infrastructure and maintenance interventions.\n- \u00b7 Response: this represents the phase in which the operational capacity to cope with an emergency upon the occurrence of an extreme event is assessed. It is directly related to the ability to mobilize operational resources in the /fi.ligaeld and the capacity to remotely restore power supply through resilient backup systems.\n- \u00b7 Readiness: this includes all measures aimed at increasing the speed with which a potentially critical event can be identi/fi.ligaed, ensuring coordination with Civil Protection authorities and local institutions and preparing the necessary resources once a grid disruption has occurred.\n- \u00b7 Recovery: this is the last phase, in which the goal is to return the network to ordinary operating conditions as soon as possible in cases where an extreme weather event has caused service interruptions despite the increased resilience measures taken previously.\n\nFollowing this approach, the Business Line has prepared various policies for speci/fi.ligac actions to address the various aspects and risks associated with climate change. In particular:\n\nThis policy covers the last three phases of the 4R approach, indicating guidelines and measures to improve preparation strategies, mitigate the impact of total blackouts and, /fi.liganally, restore service to as many customers as possible in the sho/r\\_t.ligaest time possible.\n\nThis policy seeks to identify the most impactful extraordinary climate events on the network, to evaluate the speci/fi.ligac KPIs of the network and to improve them based on proposed interventions in order to be able to evaluate the order of priority. In this manner, actions are selected that, when implemented, will minimize the impact on the network of pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical extreme events in a given area/region. The policy therefore covers the /fi.ligarst two phases of the 4R approach, suggesting measures regarding risk prevention and readiness.\n\nIn Italy, this policy has been translated into the Resilience Plan that e-distribuzione has prepared each year since 2017, which represents an addendum to the Development Plan for investments over a 3-year time horizon to reduce the impact of extreme events in ce/r\\_t.ligaain critical areas, namely heat waves, icing and windstorms (with the associated risk of falling trees). In 2017-2020, some \u20ac520 million were invested and about \u20ac345 million will be invested in the following three-year period, as speci/fi.ligaed in the addendum to the 2021-2023 Plan.

The document provides guidelines to be implemented in the various territories involved to identify areas/plant at risk, de/fi.ligane speci/fi.ligac prevention measures (e.g., evaluation of speci/fi.ligac maintenance plans and any upgrades) and, in the event of a /fi.ligare, manage the emergency optimally in order to limit its impact and restore service as soon as possible.\n\nThese include the implementation of systems for weather forecasting, monitoring the status of the network and evaluating the impact of critical climate phenomena on the network, the preparation of operational plans and the organization of speci/fi.ligac exercises. Pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly impo/r\\_t.ligaant in this regard are advance agreements for the mobilization of extraordinary resources to respond to emergencies, comprising both internal personnel and contractors. For example, in Italy a trial has begun of sensors on above-ground lines in areas that are highly exposed to snow and wind (Project Newman).\n\nMoreover, with a view not only to assessing weather emergencies in the sho/r\\_t.liga/medium term, but also in consideration of the climate change we are witnessing, Infrastructure and Networks is mapping key phenomena at the global level as pa/r\\_t.liga of an analysis of the speci/fi.ligac climate risks in countries in which it operates, seeking to associate a risk level with each phenomenon and prioritize the most exposed areas.\n\nInfrastructure and Networks is collaborating with leading research institutes to analyze trends in the most critical threats in the various countries in which the Group operates, and to estimate their future impact on the network in the medium and long term.\n\nThe following are some examples.\n\n## Heavy rainfall/wind storms\n\n- \u00b7 In 2021, the selection of external pa/r\\_t.liganers was initiated for an investigation of scenarios concerning the evolution of intense rainfall events in various countries. For example, with regard to explosive cyclogenesis in Spain, a preliminary survey of the events with the greatest impact on the grid was conducted, following the policy concerning the enhancement of grid resilience, which will form the basis for subsequent detailed analyses sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2022.\n\n## Heat waves\n\n- \u00b7 In 2021, heat waves in the other countries in which Infra-\n\nructure and Networks operates were investigated further after having produced initial results for Italy in 2020. This critical event is characterized by the persistence of high temperatures over a period of several days in correspondence with the absence of precipitation which, by hindering the dissipation of heat from underground cables, causes an anomalous increase in the risk of multiple failures on grids, especially in urban areas and in summer tourist locales.\n\n- \u00b7 Finally, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2022, similar analytical work will be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in other geographical areas.\n- \u00b7 In Spain, despite the increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, especially where the presence of underground cables is relatively low, no signi/fi.ligacant historical correlation between heat waves and failures has been found in the analyses conducted to date.\n\n## Wild/fi.ligares\n\n- \u00b7 With  regard  to  /fi.ligare  risk,  despite  the  insigni/fi.ligacance  of events recorded to date, the Business Line, consistent with the policy noted above, is preparing an in-depth analysis of the scenarios through 2050 concerning the evolution of the phenomenon, with a view to possible improvements in the policy itself.

This makes it possible to adopt even more e/ff.ligaective construction or maintenance design measures with a view to preventing /fi.ligare risk.\n\n## Inclusion of climate change e/ff.ligaects in the assessment of new projects\n\nMany activities connected with the evaluation and implementation of new projects can bene/fi.ligat from general and site-speci/fi.ligac climate analyses, which the Group is beginning to integrate with those already considered in the evaluation of new projects. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 estimation of expected output: the climate scenarios will be progressively integrated to enable the evaluation of how climate change will modify the availability of renewable sources at the speci/fi.ligac site. In the in-depth development of the preliminary analyses on potential output, the approach applied for now to selected pilot sites is described and then scaled up over the entire generation po/r\\_t.ligafolio;\n- \u00b7 preliminary studies: in this phase, climate data can serve as a preliminary screening tool, with the analysis of speci/fi.ligac climate phenomena, such as those discussed previously in the analysis of physical scenarios, and synthetic indicators such as the Climate Risk Index, integrated into the Open Country Risk model. These data provide a preliminary measure of the most relevant phenomena in an area among those identi/fi.ligaed as being relevant for each technology;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLimits on emissions and carbon pricing\n\nIncentives for the energy transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 environmental impact analysis: the Group has begun to integrate a Climate Change Risk Assessment into project documentation. This contains a representation of the main physical phenomena and their expected change in the area;\n- \u00b7 resilient design: as noted, the development of resilient assets  by  design  is  a  key  climate  change  adaptation activity. The Group is working to progressively consider analyses based on climate data, such as the increase in the frequency and intensity of acute events. The la/t\\_t.ligaer will integrate existing analyses based on historical data already in use, in order to increase the resilience of future assets, including all necessary adaptation actions over the useful life of a project.\n\n## Transition phenomena: repercussions on our business, risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities\n\nWith regard to the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with transition variables, we use the di/ff.ligaerent reference scenarios in combination with the elements that make up the risk identi/fi.ligacation process (e.g., competitive context, long-term vision of the industry, materiality analysis, technological evolution, etc.) to identify the drivers of potential risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities. Priority is given to the most material phenomena. The main risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities identi/fi.ligaed within this framework are described below.\n\nThe enactment of laws and regulations that introduce more stringent emission limits by government action (non-market driven) and market-based mechanisms.\n\n- \u00b7 Risks: lack of a coordinated approach among the various actors and policy-makers involved and limited e/ff.ligaectiveness of the policy instruments deployed, with an impact on the speed of the trend towards electri/fi.ligacation and decarbonization in the various sectors, compared with a decisive Group strategy focused on the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 Oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: command & control regulations and market-based mechanisms strengthening CO 2 price signals to foster investment in carbon-free technologies.\n\nDevelopment incentives and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities with a view to the energy transition, consequently guiding the energy system towards the use of low-emission energy resources as the mainstream approach in the energy mixes of countries, greater electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, energy e/ffi.ligaciency, /fl.ligaexibility of the electrical system and upgrading of infrastructure, with a positive impact on the return on investment and new business oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities.\n\n- \u00b7 Risks: obstacles to achieving energy-transition targets due to regulatory systems that do no e/ff.ligaectively suppo/r\\_t.liga the energy transition (delays in permi/t\\_t.ligaing processes, no upgrading of the electricity grid, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: additional volumes and greater margins due to additional investment in the electricity industry, in line with the electri/fi.ligacation strategy, decarbonization and the upgrading/digitalization of enabling infrastructure.",

Thanks to our industrial and /fi.liganancial strategy incorporating ESG factors, an integrated approach shaped by sustainability and innovation makes it possible to create long-term shared value.\n\nA strategy focused on complete decarbonization and the energy transition makes the Group resilient to the risks associated with the introduction of more ambitious policies for emissions reductions and maximizes oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for the development of renewable generation, infrastructure and enabling technologies.\n\nUnlike chronic climate impacts, developments in the transition scenario could have impacts in the sho/r\\_t.liga and medium/long term (by 2030) as well.\n\nAs with climate variables, we can test the current Business Plan (2022-2024) for its sensitivity to the factors potentially in/fl.ligauenced by the transition scenario, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular regard to the price of CO 2 (ETS). Examining the main transition variables, the price of CO 2 appears to be a reliable driver of regulatory measures that could accelerate the transition process. To assess the impact of possible changes in this driver, the e/ff.ligaects of a potential change of +/-10% in the CO 2 price for Italy and Spain are determined. This price change would modify the equilibrium price of both wholesale markets, with repercussions on the margins of Global Power Generation for both conventional and renewables plants.\n\nTo quantify the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities engendered by the energy transition in the long term, the transition scenarios described in the section 'Enel's energy-transition scenarios' have been considered. The e/ff.ligaects of the Slow Transition and Best Place scenarios on the variables that can most impact the business were then identi/fi.ligaed, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular electricity demand in/fl.ligauenced by developments in the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption - and hence the penetration of electrical technologies - and the power generation mix. These considerations o/ff.ligaer ideas for determining what the Group's strategic positioning for resource allocation could be.\n\nEnel's benchmark scenario - the Paris scenario - envisages a greater ambition for decarbonization and energy e/ffi.ligaciency, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by increasing the electri/fi.ligacation of /fi.liga-\n\nnal energy consumption and the development of renewables capacity. The dynamics of the energy transition could bring greater oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for the Group. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, on the retail electricity market, the progressive electri/fi.ligacation of /fi.liganal consumption - in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular in transpo/r\\_t.ligaation and the residential segment - will lead to a signi/fi.ligacant increase in electricity consumption to the detriment of other more polluting forms of energy. Likewise, the gradual increase in renewables share of the energy mix should lead to a reduction in the wholesale price of electricity in the medium to long term. This impact is limited, however, considering an unchanged market design based on system marginal prices in the medium term. Any alternative market structures could induce di/ff.ligaerent e/ff.ligaects.\n\nWith regard to the /fi.liganancial impact of changes in transition scenarios, the Group analyzed the impact of the Slow Transition and Best Place scenarios on 2030 results in terms of EBITDA compared with the benchmark Paris scenario.\n\nWith regard to the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption, however, the Slow Transition scenario envisages lower penetration rates for the most e/ffi.ligacient electrical technologies, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular electric vehicles and heat pumps, producing a decrease in electricity demand compared with the Paris scenario, which would have a limited impact on the commodity and beyond-commodity retail business. At the same time, the decline in electricity demand would leave less room for growth in renewables, with an impact on the generation business.\n\nThe Best Place scenario assumes a more rapid reduction in the costs of green hydrogen production technologies. This  translates  into  greater  penetration  for  this  energy source, displacing blue and gray hydrogen, with a consequent additive e/ff.ligaect on national electricity demand and the installation of renewables capacity compared with the Paris scenario.\n\nAll of the scenarios, but especially the Paris and Best Place scenarios, will entail a considerable increase in the complexities that will have to be managed by grids in the various geographical areas. In fact, we expect a signi/fi.ligacant increase in distributed generation and other resources, such as storage systems, the greater penetration of electric mobility with the related charging infrastructures, as well as the growing rate of electri/fi.ligacation of consumption",

The commodity risk control process limits the impact of unexpected changes in market prices on margins and, at the same time, ensures an adequate margin of /fl.ligaexibility that makes it possible to seize sho/r\\_t.liga-term oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities.\n\nBeginning in 2021, monitoring of the risk was extended to the main raw materials to which the Group is exposed.\n\nIn order to mitigate the risk of interruptions in the supply of fuel and raw materials, the Group has diversi/fi.ligaed fuel sources, using suppliers from di/ff.ligaerent geographical areas.\n\nIn 2021, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a complex global economic crisis, causing signi/fi.ligacant increases in the volatility of prices of energy commodities and other raw materials. Enel has contained the risk below the limits estimated in 2020 for 2021, thanks to careful and timely mitigation measures, the geographical diversi/fi.ligacation of our business, the growing impetus given to the energy transition through the decarbonization process and the use of renewable sources for power generation. Finally, the adoption of global and local strategies, such as /fl.ligaexibility in contractual clauses and proxy hedging techniques (in the event that hedging derivatives are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid), has made it possible to optimize results even in a highly dynamic market context.\n\nIn view of their geographical diversi/fi.ligacation, access to international markets for the issuance of debt instruments and transactions in commodities, Group companies are exposed to the risk that changes in exchange rates between the presentation currency and other currencies could generate unexpected changes in the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and /fi.liganancial aggregates in their respective /fi.liganancial statements.\n\nGiven the current structure of Enel, the exposure to currency risk is mainly linked to the US dollar and is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to:\n\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaows in respect of investments, dividends from foreign subsidiaries or the purchase or sale of equity investments;\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaows in respect of the purchase or sale of fuel or electricity;\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaows connected with commercial relationships;\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe possible impacts of currency risk are re/fl.ligaected in:\n\n- \u00b7 revaluations or adjustments to fair value of /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities sensitive to exchange rates (transaction risk);\n- \u00b7 costs and revenue denominated in foreign currencies with respect to the time at which pricing conditions were de/fi.liganed or the investment decision was made (economic risk);\n- \u00b7 the consolidation of subsidiaries with di/ff.ligaerent currencies of account (translation risk).\n\nThe currency risk management policy is based on systematically hedging the exposures of the Group companies, with the exception of translation risk.\n\nAppropriate operational processes ensure the de/fi.liganition and implementation of appropriate hedging strategies, which typically employ /fi.liganancial derivatives obtained on OTC markets.

At the same time, this approach preserves the necessary /fl.ligaexibility to optimize po/r\\_t.ligafolio management.\n\nIn addition, the Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes transactions to factor receivables without recourse, which results in the complete derecognition of the corresponding assets involved in the factoring. Finally, with regard to /fi.liganancial and commodity transactions, risk mitigation is pursued through the diversi/fi.ligacation of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio (giving preference to counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies with a high credit rating) and the adoption of speci/fi.ligac standardized contractual frameworks that contain risk mitigation clauses (e.g. ne/t\\_t.ligaing arrangements) and possibly the exchange of cash collateral.\n\nDespite the deterioration in the collection status of ce/r\\_t.ligaain customer segments, which was taken into consideration in determining impairment of trade receivables, the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio has so far demonstrated resilience to the global pandemic. This re/fl.ligaects the expansion of digital collection channels and a solid diversi/fi.ligacation of commercial customers with a low exposure to the impact of COVID-19 (e.g., utilities and distribution companies).\n\nEnel's liquidity risk management policy is designed to maintain su/ffi.ligacient liquidity to meet expected commitments over a given time horizon without reso/r\\_t.ligaing to additional sources of /fi.liganancing, also retaining a prudential liquidity reserve, su/ffi.ligacient to meet any unexpected commitments.

A deterioration in the credit rating could therefore restrict access to the capital market and/or increase the cost of funding, with consequent negative e/ff.ligaects on the /fi.liganancial position, /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and cash /fl.ligaows of the Group.\n\nIn 2021, Enel's risk pro/fi.ligale only changed compared with 2020 for Moody's, whose rating went from 'Baa2' with a positive outlook to 'Baa1' with a stable outlook. Enel's rating remained 'BBB+' with a stable outlook for Standard & Poor's and 'A-' with a stable outlook for Fitch.\n\nIn order to manage liquidity e/ffi.ligaciently, treasury activities have largely been centralized at the Parent level, meeting liquidity requirements primarily by drawing on the cash generated by ordinary operations and managing any cash surpluses appropriately.\n\nAs regards the impact of COVID-19, despite the e/ff.ligaects of the pandemic the liquidity risk indices monitored for the Group remained within the limits established for 2021.\n\n## Digital Technology risks\n\nThe risks discussed in this section are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cyber security\n\nThe speed of technological developments that constantly generate new challenges, the ever-increasing frequency and intensity of cyber-a/t\\_t.ligaacks and the a/t\\_t.ligaraction of critical infrastructures and strategic industrial sectors as targets underscore the potential risk that, in extreme cases, the normal operations of companies could grind to a halt. Cyber-a/t\\_t.ligaacks have evolved dramatically in recent years: their number has grown exponentially, as has their complexity and impact (theft of company data on customers), making it increasingly di/ffi.ligacult to promptly identify the source of threats. In the case of the Enel Group, this exposure re/fl.ligaects the many environments in which it operates (data, industry and people), a circumstance that accompanies the intrinsic complexity and interconnection of the resources that over the years have been increasingly integrated into the Group's daily operating processes.\n\nThe Group has adopted a holistic governance approach to cyber security that is applied to all the\n\nsectors of IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology) and IoT (Internet of Things). The framework is based on the commitment of top management, on global strategic management, on the involvement of all business areas as well as of the units involved in the design and implementation of our systems. It seeks to use cu/t\\_t.ligaing edge technologies, to design ad hoc business processes, to strengthen people's IT awareness and to implement regulatory requirements for IT security.\n\nIn addition, the Group has developed an IT risk management methodology founded on 'riskbased' and 'cyber security by design' approaches, thus integrating the analysis of business risks into all strategic decisions. Enel has also created its own Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) in order to proactively respond to any IT security incidents.\n\nFinally, back in 2019, the Group also took out an insurance policy for cyber security risks in order to mitigate those risks with other tools in addition to technical countermeasures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A consequence of this digital transformation is that the Group is increasingly exposed to risks related to the functioning of the IT systems, which are integrated across the Company with impacts on processes and operations, which could expose IT and OT systems to service interruptions or data losses.\n\nThese risks are managed using a series of internal measures developed by the Global Digital Solutions (GDS) unit, which is responsible for guiding the Group's digital transformation. It has set up an internal control system that introduces control points along the entire IT value chain, enabling us to prevent the emergence of risks engendered by such issues as the creation of services that do not meet business needs, the failure to adopt adequate security measures and service interruptions. The internal control system of the Global Digital Solutions unit oversees both the activities pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in-house and those outsourced to external associates and service providers. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, Enel is promoting the dissemination of a digital culture and digital skills within the Group in order to successfully guide the digital transformation and minimize the associated risks.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nThe risks discussed in this section are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and safety\n\nThe main health and safety risks to which Enel personnel and contractors are exposed are associated with operations at the Group's sites and assets. The violation of the laws,  regulations  and  procedures  governing  health  and safety,  work  environments,  management  of  corporate structures,  assets  and  processes,  which  could  have  an adverse impact on the health of employees, workers or stakeholders, can give rise to the risk of incurring administrative or judicial penalties and related economic, /fi.liganancial and reputational impacts. These risks were identi/fi.ligaed through an analysis of the main events that have occurred in the last three years. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in terms of probability of occurrence, mechanical incidents (falls, collisions, crushing and cuts) are the most common, while the most severe in terms of potential associated impact are electrical incidents (possibly fatal injuries).\n\nIn addition, in relation to the presence of the Group in di/ff.ligaerent areas of the world, employees and contractors could be exposed to health risks connected with potential emerging infectious diseases of a pandemic and po-\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety\n- \u00b7 Procurement, logistics and supply chain\n- \u00b7 Environment\n- \u00b7 People and organization\n\ntentially pandemic nature, which could have an impact on their health and well-being.\n\nEnel has adopted a Declaration of Commitment to Health and Safety, signed by the Group's top management.\n\nIn implementing the policy, each Group Business Line has its own Occupational Health and Safety Management System compliant with the international standard BS OHSAS 18001, which is based on the identi/fi.ligacation of hazards, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of risks, the planning  and  implementation  of  prevention  and  protection measures, the veri/fi.ligacation of the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the prevention and protection measures and any corrective actions.

As a result, they are called upon to increase their commitment and accountability for developing and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and development models.\n\nEnel has made the e/ff.ligaective prevention and minimization of environmental impacts and risks a foundational element of each project across its entire life cycle.\n\nThe adoption of ISO 14001-ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed environmental man-\n\nstructure and the related management processes make it possible to direct, integrate and monitor, both at Group level and in the individual countries in which it operates, all the prevention, protection and intervention actions aimed at protecting the health of employees and contractors, also in relation to exogenous health risk factors that may not be strictly related to work activities.\n\nAdditional information on risk management is provided in the 'Workplace health and safety' section.\n\nagement systems across the entire Group ensures the implementation of structured policies and procedures to identify and manage the environmental risks and opportunities associated with all corporate activities. A structured control plan combined with improvement actions and objectives inspired by the best environmental practices, with requirements exceeding those for simple environmental regulatory compliance, mitigate the risk of impacts on the environment, reputational damage and litigation. Also contributing are the multitude of actions to achieve the challenging environmental improvement objectives set by Enel, such as those regarding atmospheric emissions, waste production and water consumption, especially in areas with high water stress.\n\nThe risk of water scarcity is directly mitigated by Enel's development strategy, which is based on the growth of generation from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on the availability of water for their operation. Special a/t\\_t.ligaention is also devoted to assets in areas with a high level of water stress, in order to develop technological solutions to reduce consumption. Ongoing collaboration with local river basin management authorities enables us to adopt the most e/ff.ligaective shared strategies for the sustainable management of hydroelectric generation assets.\n\nFinally, with regard to protecting biodiversity, an analysis of the impacts/dependencies of the business on natural resources was conducted and priority areas for action were de/fi.liganed along the entire value chain. On the basis of this analysis, appropriate terrestrial, marine and river monitoring actions are being implemented in ecosystems to verify the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the measures adopted to protect, restore and conserve biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These reclassi/fi.ligaed schedules contain di/ff.ligaerent pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicators from those obtained directly from the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements and separate /fi.liganancial statements, which management believes are useful in monitoring the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the Group and the Parent and representative of the /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and position of our business.\n\nWith regard to those indicators, on April 29, 2021, CONSOB issued warning notice no. 5/21, which gives force to the Guidelines issued on March 4, 2021 by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on disclosure requirements under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the Prospectus Regulation), which took e/ff.ligaect on May 5, 2021.\n\nThe Guidelines update the previous CESR Recommendations (ESMA/2013/319, in the revised version of March 20, 2013) with the exception of those concerning the special issuers referred to in Annex no. 29 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980, which were not conve/r\\_t.ligaed into Guidelines and remain applicable.\n\nAccordingly, as from May 5, 2021, the references to the above  CESR  Recommendations  contained  in  previous CONSOB  communications  shall  be  considered  to  have been replaced by references to the ESMA Guidelines cited above, including the references in Communication no. DEM/6064293 of July 28, 2006 regarding the net /fi.liganancial position.\n\nThe Guidelines are intended to promote the usefulness and  transparency  of  alternative  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  indicators included in regulated information or prospectuses within the scope of application of Directive 2003/71/EC in order to improve their comparability, reliability and comprehensibility.\n\nIn line with the regulations cited above, the criteria used to construct these indicators are the following.\n\nGross operating pro/fi.ligat : an operating pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicator,  calculated  as  'Operating  pro/fi.ligat'  plus  'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and impairment losses'.\n\nOrdinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat : de/fi.liganed as 'Gross operat-\n\ning pro/fi.ligat' from core businesses connected with the Ownership and Stewardship business models. It does not include costs connected with corporate restructurings and costs directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOrdinary  operating  pro/fi.ligat :  de/fi.liganed  as  'Operating  pro/fi.ligat' from core businesses connected with the Ownership and Stewardship business models.\n\nIt is calculated by adjusting 'Operating pro/fi.ligat' for the effects of transactions not connected with core operations referred to with regard to gross operating pro/fi.ligat and excluding  signi/fi.ligacant  impairment  losses  on  assets  and/or groups of assets following impairment testing (including reversals of impairment losses) or classi/fi.ligacation under 'Assets held for sale'.\n\nGroup ordinary pro/fi.ligat : it is de/fi.liganed as 'Group pro/fi.ligat' generated by Enel's core business connected with the Ownership and Stewardship business models.\n\nIt is equal to 'Group pro/fi.ligat' adjusted primarily for the items discussed under 'Ordinary operating pro/fi.ligat', net of any tax e/ff.ligaects and non-controlling interests.\n\nLow carbon ordinary EBITDA : it is the ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat of the set of products, services and technologies included in the following Business Lines: Enel Green Power, Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X and End-user Markets (excluding gas).\n\nNet non-current assets : calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between 'Non-current assets' and 'Non-current liabilities' with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 'Securities'  and  'Other  /fi.liganancial  assets'  included  in 'Other non-current /fi.liganancial assets';\n- \u00b7 'Deferred tax assets';\n- \u00b7 'Long-term borrowings';\n- \u00b7 'Provisions for risks and charges (non-current po/r\\_t.ligaion)';\n- \u00b7 'Employee bene/fi.ligats';\n- \u00b7 'Deferred tax liabilities'.\n\nNet working capital : calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between 'Current assets' and 'Current liabilities' with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 'Current po/r\\_t.ligaion of long-term loan assets', 'Factoring receivables', 'Securities', 'Cash collateral' and 'Other /fi.liganancial assets' included in 'Other current /fi.liganancial assets';\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase was a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the growing de-\n\nmand for electricity compared with the previous year, with a rise in thermal generation, which o/ff.ligaset the decline in hydroelectric generation for the year.\n\nElectricity generated by Enel from zero-emission sources in 2021 amounted to 60.3% of total output, a slight decrease compared with 2020 as a result of the increase in fossil fuel generation, but still signi/fi.ligacantly higher than in 2019 (when it was equal to 54.9%) due to the increase in solar and wind generation.\n\nSpeci/fi.ligac emissions of SO 2 and pa/r\\_t.ligaiculates declined compared with 2020 by 30% and over 50%, respectively. Speci/fi.ligac NO x emissions also recorded a slight decrease (-2.8% compared with 2020).\n\n## Responsible water resource management\n\n|                                                       |                    |   2021 |   2020 | Change   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Total withdrawals                                     | (millions of m 3 ) |   55.6 |   51.5 | 4.1      | 8.0%     |\n| Water withdrawals in water-stressed areas (1)         | (%)                |   27.4 |   23.3 | 4.1      | 17.6 %   |\n| Speci/fi.ligac water requirement for total generation | (l/kWh eq )        |    0.2 |    0.2 | -        | -        |\n| Total water consumption                               | (millions of m 3 ) |   26.3 |   20.4 | 5.9      | 28.9%    |\n| Water consumption in water-stressed areas (%) (1)     | (%)                |   33.8 |   31.6 | 2.2      | 7. 0 %   |\n\nWater  is  an  essential  pa/r\\_t.liga  of  electricity  generation,  although the gradual shift to renewables, notably solar and wind, is reducing the speci/fi.ligac water requirement.\n\nEnel constantly monitors all generation sites located in areas at risk of water scarcity (water-stressed areas) in order to ensure the most e/ffi.ligacient management of the resource. Site monitoring is conducted through the following levels of analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 mapping of generation sites in water-stressed areas identi/fi.ligaed on the basis of the (baseline) water stress conditions indicated by the World Resources Institute 'Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas';\n\n## Preserving biodiversity\n\nPreserving biodiversity is one of the strategic objectives of Enel's environmental policy. The Group promotes speci/fi.ligac projects in the various areas in which it operates in order to help protect local species, their natural habitats, and the local ecosystems in general. These projects cover a vast range of areas, including: inventory and monitoring; programs to protect speci/fi.ligac species at risk of extinction;\n\nmethodological research and other studies; repopulation and reforestation; the construction of infrastructure suppo/r\\_t.ligas to promote the presence and activities of various species (e.g., a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial nests along power distribution lines for birds or /fi.ligash ladders at hydroelectric plants), and ecological restoration and reforestation programs.\n\nIn 2021, 183 projects were under way to safeguard spe-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 identi/fi.ligacation of 'critical' generation sites, i.e., those located in water-stressed areas that draw fresh water for operating needs;\n- \u00b7 veri/fi.ligacation of  the  water  management  procedures adopted in these plants in order to minimize consumption and maximize withdrawals from lower quality or more abundant sources (waste, industrial or sea water).\n\nAbout 14% of the Enel Group's total electricity output uses fresh water in water-stressed areas. In 2021 total water requirements (17) were 46.5 million cubic meters, an increase of 8% on 2020 owing to the rise in thermal generation. The speci/fi.ligac water requirement for 2021 was 0.2 l/kWh eq .",

The area involved in restoration projects in 2021 increased compared with\n\nthe previous year (4,356 hectares in 2020), re/fl.ligaecting both the sta/r\\_t.liga of new restoration projects and an increase in the areas involved in restoration as pa/r\\_t.liga of existing projects.\n\n## Electricity distribution and access, ecosystems and platforms\n\nElectricity transpo/r\\_t.ligaed on Enel's distribution grid totaled 510.3 TWh in 2021, up 25.1 TWh (+5.2%) from 2020, a/t\\_t.ligaributable essentially to Italy (+12.3 TWh), Spain (+6.6 TWh) and Brazil (+2.5 TWh).\n\nThe number of Enel end users with active sma/r\\_t.liga meters increased by 675,491 in 2021, mainly in Italy (+332,311) and Romania (+205,006).\n\nElectricity sold by Enel in 2021 came to 309.4 TWh, increasing by 11.2 TWh (+3.8%) compared with the previous year. Quantities increased mainly in Italy (+2.6 TWh) and Latin America (+9.5 TWh) - mainly in Brazil (+4.1 TWh) and Chile (+3.7 TWh). In addition, gas sold by Enel in 2021 totaled 9.9 billion cubic meters, an increase of 0.2 billion cubic meters compared with the previous year.\n\nEnel's leadership position has been gained thanks to the a/t\\_t.ligaention we place on the customer in providing quality services: aspects that concern more than just the provision of electricity and/or natural gas, extending, above all, to intangible aspects of our service that relate to the perception and satisfaction of our customers.\n\nThrough our products for both the residential and business markets, Enel provides dedicated o/ff.ligaers with a lower environmental impact and a concentration on the most vulnerable segments of the population. In fact, all the countries in which the Group operates provide forms of suppo/r\\_t.liga (often linked to government initiatives) which assist these segments of the population in paying their electricity and gas bills, so as to give everyone equal access to electricity. Enel has also established numerous processes to ensure customers receive a high level of service. In Italy, the commercial quality of all our contact channels (customer service calls, Enel Points and stores, utility bills, app, e-mail, social media, account manager, fax) is ensured through systematic monitoring of the sales and management processes.\n\nThe goal is to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and respect for the privacy, freedom and dig-\n\nnity of our customers.\n\nIn order to ensure the quality, accessibility and reliability of its service, Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to ensuring an e/ffi.ligacient and digitalized electricity grid, which enables a more sustainable lifestyle through the use of electricity for all our customers. As a DSO (distribution system operator), Enel has embraced the challenges of the energy transition to develop the grid of the future: sma/r\\_t.liga, modern and digital. To suppo/r\\_t.liga this ambitious transformation, Grid Futurability\u00ae has been launched, a new long-term strategy to design the grid that Enel intends to create by 2030, both from an industrial point of view and in integration with stakeholders, with the aim of preparing it to suppo/r\\_t.liga a decarbonized and electri/fi.ligaed world.\n\nThe grid also represents a 'mine of materials' that, when suitably regenerated, can be used as inputs in the production of new assets or new products in other production chains. Using an approach called 'grid mining', the entire value chain of assets is being analyzed in order to recover valuable materials/devices from obsolete grid infrastructures, with the aim of minimizing the environmental impact and the consumption of resources by maximizing the positive social aspects, with a view to creating long-term value.\n\nEnel is also continuing its e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas to expand digitalization, electronic invoicing and new services. With Enel X, we o/ff.ligaer innovative solutions to residential customers (technological solutions for sma/r\\_t.liga homes, home automation, solar and photovoltaic systems, boilers, maintenance services, lighting, etc.), government customers (public lighting, monitoring services for sma/r\\_t.liga cities, security systems, etc.) and large customers (demand response services, consulting and energy e/ffi.ligaciency solutions). We also promote electric mobility through the development of public and private charging infrastructures. Enel charging points increased by 52,130 units in 2021\n\ncompared with 2020. Private charging points increased by 48,430, mainly in No/r\\_t.ligah America and Italy, while public charging points increased by 3,700, primarily in Italy and Spain.",

However, some exceptions were also made to provide a more detailed representation of the /fi.ligagures or to exclude ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac activities from the overall eligibility-alignment calculation (such as non-aligned hydroelectric generation or infrastructure considered eligible-not aligned among eligible-aligned distribution systems). For example, the following proxies were used:\n- -distribution: new connections between a substation or  network  and  a  generation  plant  whose  greenhouse gas intensity exceeds the threshold of 100 gCO 2eq /kWh have been excluded considering their power (in MW) multiplied by average revenue (thousands of euro/MW) for 2020 and 2021. This approach was only applied to revenue and capital expenditure;\n- -hydroelectric: eligible-not aligned hydroelectric plants were excluded considering their output multiplied by average unit revenue for 2020 and 2021. This approach was also extended to capital expenditure, ordinary operating expenses and ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat;\n- \u00b7 the aggregate /fi.liganancial data in the repo/r\\_t.ligaing refer to 'segment' values and include items concerning third pa/r\\_t.ligaies and inter-segment transactions;\n- \u00b7 revenue from electricity sales was calculated considering the quantity of retail power sales by Group companies in Italy and Spain accompanied by Ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates of\n\nOrigin (based on data from national authorities) and applying the average unit revenue. This revenue is considered eligible-aligned since it regards electricity generated using technologies that comply with the technical screening criteria of the European taxonomy. This approach was also implemented for capital expenditure, ordinary operating expenses and ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat. To prevent double counting, eligible revenue by sector is included net of inter-segment transactions (Enel Green Power, Distribution and Retail);\n\n- -electricity generation: 100% of geothermal installed capacity  is  now  considered  eligible-aligned  compared  with  10%  in  the  previous  analysis,  while  an additional 0.5% of hydroelectric installed capacity is now considered eligible (rising from 99% to 99.5%);\n- \u00b7 the 2020 data were recalculated on the basis of the new eligibility analysis pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in 2021 after the publication of the 2020 Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga and the publication of the Climate Delegated Act in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal of the European Union. The main di/ff.ligaerences in each business segment are as follows:\n- -electricity  transmission  and  distribution:  DSOs  in Chile, Colombia and Peru are now considered eligible and new infrastructure installed in 2020 to connect power plants with a carbon intensity threshold above 100 gCO2 eq /kWh have been excluded from the /fi.liganancial data of all eligible-aligned DSOs;\n- -sales: the retail sale of electricity in Italy and Spain accompanied by Ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates of Origin is now considered eligible-aligned (it was previously considered not eligible);\n- -Enel X: e-Home and distributed generation solutions are now considered eligible-aligned (they were previously considered not eligible);\n- \u00b7 total revenue, capital expenditure and ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat of each speci/fi.ligac activity correspond to Group totals, while the total ordinary operating expenses of each speci/fi.ligac activity correspond only to the total ordinary costs considered in the types of operating expenses envisaged under the European taxonomy;\n- \u00b7 the share of the KPIs relating to each individual economic activity is calculated on the basis of the total revenue, capital expenditure and ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat of the Group and the total ordinary costs considered in the types of operating expenses envisaged by the European taxonomy.

This is the only European taxonomy objective repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the table, as the alignment analysis was pe/r\\_f.ligaormed only for this objective as it is more relevant than the climate change adaptation objective and the criteria for the other environmental objectives are not yet available.\n\nThe 2021-2023 Strategic Plan presented on the occasion of the 2020 Capital Markets Day held in November 2020 declared that between 80% and 90% of capital expenditure was aligned with the European taxonomy for the three-\n\nyear period, re/fl.ligaecting the regulatory unce/r\\_t.ligaainty prevailing when it was announced (the Climate Delegated Act had not yet been approved). However, 85.6% of the capital expenditure established for 2021 in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan is now considered to be aligned with the European taxonomy according to the updated analysis conducted in 2021. The same main changes are considered for the restated 2020 data. In addition, the new 2022-2024 Strategic Plan presented on the occasion of the 2021 Capital Markets Day states that over 85% of capital expenditure will be allocated to aligned activities in the 2022-2024 period.\n\n## Statement on the alignment of Enel's business with the European taxonomy\n\nIn 2021, the level of alignment of the Group's economic activities with the European taxonomy due to their substantial  contribution  to  the  climate  change  mitigation objective, in compliance with the principle of not doing harm to other environmental objectives (DNSH)  and the minimum social safeguards is indicated in the following tables and in the sections 'Revenue', 'Costs', 'Ordinary\n\ngross operating pro/fi.ligat/(loss)' and 'Capital expenditure'.\n\nFinally, EU taxonomy repo/r\\_t.ligaing pursuant to the European taxonomy regulation and the delegated act is provided in full in the 2021 Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga - Non-Financial Statement pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/852.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable /fi.liganance: private and public /fi.liganance to mobilize capital at the service of climate objectives\n\nFor Enel, 'sustainable /fi.liganance' means the synergy between private  and  public  /fi.liganance.  In  pa/r\\_t.ligaicular,  private  /fi.liganance conveys private capital towards sustainable investments or for the bene/fi.ligat of companies whose strategic action is directed at ce/r\\_t.ligaain sustainability objectives, re/fl.ligaecting the economic and /fi.liganancial value of sustainability in a lower borrowing costs. Public /fi.liganance, on the other hand, stimulates  the  creation  of  sustainable  investments  through grants and loans at subsidized interest rates.\n\nAt Enel, sustainable /fi.liganance plays a crucial role in suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the Group's sustainable growth, representing, at the end of 2021, more than half of our gross debt and contributing to a progressive reduction in the cost of debt through the recognition of the value of sustainability.\n\nIt is for this reason that during 2021 Enel extended this sustainability-linked approach to all its /fi.liganancial debt instruments, with the publication of the 'Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework', a comprehensive document with which Enel illustrated how sustainability can be integrated into its various types of /fi.liganancial transaction: credit lines, commercial paper, bond issues, guarantees and deriva-\n\ntives on interest rates and exchange rates.\n\nEnel was the /fi.ligarst company to structure a framework with these characteristics. The framework establishes a set of KPIs, targets and principles that govern the development of sustainable /fi.liganance throughout the Group with ambition and transparency, linking our /fi.liganancial strategy to our sustainability objectives.\n\nThe Group's /fi.liganancial instruments and /fi.liganancial transactions may therefore have an interest rate or other /fi.liganancial or structural terms linked to the achievement of objectives for the reduction of direct greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 13 'Climate Action') or growth in installed renewables capacity (SDG 7 'A/ff.ligaordable and Clean Energy').\n\nThe Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework was updated in January 2022 following the presentation of the new Strategic Plan and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular includes bringing forward achievement of the ambitious goal of eliminating direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) from 2050 to 2040.\n\n|                                                  | Actual       | Target   | Target   | Target       | Target       | Target       | Target       |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                  | 2021         | 2021     | 2022     | 2023         | 2024         | 2030         | 2040         |\n| Direct greenhouse gas emissions                  | 227          |          |          | 148          | 140          | 82           | 0            |\n| (Scope 1) - speci/fi.ligac                       | gCO 2eq /kWh |          |          | gCO 2eq /kWh | gCO 2eq /kWh | gCO 2eq /kWh | gCO 2eq /kWh |\n| Percentage of installed renewables  capacity (1) | 57.5 %       | 55%      | 60%      | 65%          | 66%          | 80%          | 100%         |\n\nHaving achieved 57.5% of installed renewables capacity in 2021, Enel has achieved the target set in all the /fi.liganancial instruments in which the interest rate, or other /fi.liganancial or structural terms of the transaction, are linked to a percentage of installed renewables capacity equal to or greater than 55%. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, this includes the achievement of the targets contained in the /fi.ligarst sustainability-linked bonds issued by Enel Finance International NV (EFI) in 2019 on the US and European markets.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, 2021 was an exciting year for the Group and its sustainable /fi.liganance strategy, with structured transactions amounting to the equivalent of more than \u20ac30 billion. Sta/r\\_t.ligaing with the exposures of the various industrial activities, Enel has signed agreements with multiple /fi.liganancial counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies for both derivatives and sustainable guarantees, both of which are linked to the Group's ability to achieve its sustainability objectives in subsequent years. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in March 2021, Enel agreed a sustainability-linked  revolving  credit  facility  wo/r\\_t.ligah  \u20ac10  billion,  the\n\nlargest sustainable credit line in the world at the time of signing, linked to SDG 13. In May 2021, Enel Finance America LLC structured a $5 billion commercial paper program, again linked to the same sustainability goal.\n\nWith regard to bond issues, between June and September 2021, sustainability-linked bonds in euros and dollars were issued by EFI in a total amount equivalent to about \u20ac10 billion.\n\nThese issues are linked to the achievement of Enel's sustainability goal for the reduction of direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1), in line with the Group's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework. At the same time, EFI repurchased conventional bond in circulation, not linked to the pursuit of SDG objectives, in the total amount of some \u20ac8 billion, using voluntary purchase o/ff.ligaers and the exercise of speci/fi.ligac buyback options.\n\nThis bond repurchase program, together with the new sustainability-linked bond issues, made it possible to achieve a  ratio  between  sustainable  funding  sources  and  the Group's total gross debt of about 55% at the end of 2021,\n\n<!-- image -->",

These initiatives focus on green hydrogen, renewables and storage, revitalization of the photovoltaic manufacturing industry, sma/r\\_t.liga grids, grid resilience and charging infrastructure for electric mobility. These investments are expected to have a spill-over impact on GDP of around \u20ac13.2 billion, creating over 18,000 new jobs.\n\nThe Group has also developed other projects with an indirect impact, aimed at promoting pa/r\\_t.liganerships with public and private entities, both with a view to the decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption through the expansion of electric bus /fl.ligaeets, the transition to green po/r\\_t.ligas  and  the  promotion  of  energy  e/ffi.ligaciency  in  public buildings.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in the context of subsidized loans from international and national /fi.liganancial institutions, the Group is leading an innovation process aimed at accelerating the mobilization of capital to suppo/r\\_t.liga sustainable growth through the use of sustainability-linked /fi.liganancial instruments.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2021, the Group received subsidized loans totaling \u20ac1.3 billion that, following the path taken in our private-sector /fi.liganancing, include sustainability-linked mechanisms  connected  with  SDG  13.  Among  the  main transactions, special mention goes to a \u20ac600 million sustainability-linked loan to e-distribuzione, a Group company, from the European Investment Bank (EIB), the /fi.ligarst sustainability-linked loan agreement for the EIB.\n\nIn the coming years, Enel will continue to make use of sustainable /fi.liganance tools, with the aim of achieving a ratio between sustainable borrowing and the Group's total debt of about 65% by 2024 and over 70% by 2030.\n\nSustainability-linked /fi.liganance will therefore continue to represent the pe/r\\_f.ligaect tool for linking ambitious climate objectives with funding sources and addressing the future challenges of the energy transition.\n\n## Cash /fl.ligaows\n\n|                                                                         | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                         | 2021               | 2020               | Change             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year (1)              | 6,002              | 9,080              | (3,078)            |\n| Cash /fl.ligaows from operating activities                              | 10,069             | 11,508             | (1,439)            |\n| Cash /fl.ligaows from investing activities                              | (10,875)           | (10,117)           | (758)              |\n| Cash /fl.ligaows from/(used in) /fi.liganancing activities              | 3,777              | (3,972)            | 7, 74 9            |\n| E/ff.ligaect of exchange di/ff.ligaerences on cash and cash equivalents | 17                 | (497)              | 514                |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year (2)                    | 8,990              | 6,002              | 2,988              |\n\nCash /fl.ligaows from operating activities for 2021 produced a net in/fl.ligaow of \u20ac10,069 million, down \u20ac1,439 million from the previous year, mainly re/fl.ligaecting an increase in /fi.liganancial expense connected with the early extinguishment of a number of loans replaced by new bond issues at more advantageous rates and higher taxes paid.\n\nCash /fl.ligaows from investing activities for 2021 absorbed li-\n\nquidity in the amount of \u20ac10,875 million, compared with a net out/fl.ligaow of \u20ac10,117 million in 2020.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, investments in prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, intangible assets, investment prope/r\\_t.ligay and contract assets totaled \u20ac13,108 million (including \u20ac111 million reclassi/fi.ligaed as available for sale), an increase on the previous year, as analyzed in greater in the following section.",

More speci/fi.ligacally, the increase primarily concerned the United States (\u20ac579 million), Iberia (\u20ac253 million), Colombia (\u20ac192 million), Italy (\u20ac123 million), India (\u20ac122 million), Russia (\u20ac68 million), Chile (\u20ac66 million), Peru (\u20ac26 million), Panama (\u20ac25 million), and Brazil (\u20ac30 million, net of the signi/fi.ligacant unfavorable impact of ex-\n\nents in the amount of \u20ac62 million).

Capital expenditure by Enel X increased mainly in Italy, in the amount of \u20ac63 million, in the e-Home business with the Vivi Meglio project as a result of the increase in volumes and for investments to develop global technology platforms for the digital management of this business, and in No/r\\_t.ligah America (\u20ac10 million) for the development of storage projects, as well as in Iberia in the e-Home business in response to the increase in volumes sold compared with 2020. These factors were pa/r\\_t.ligaly o/ff.ligaset by a decrease in capital expenditure in Latin America.\n\nThe growth of capital expenditure in Thermal Generation and Trading, especially in Italy (\u20ac123 million), is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the conversion of a number of plants from coal to gas with lower CO 2 emissions.\n\nFinally, with regard to capital expenditure (capex), we repo/r\\_t.liga the results of the alignment of this indicator with the European taxonomy by reason of its substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, in compliance with the principle of not doing harm to other environmental objectives (DNSH) and the minimum social safeguards, as discussed in the sections 'European Union taxonomy' and 'Statement on the alignment of Enel's business with the European taxonomy'.\n\n## Capital expenditure (capex) under the European taxonomy (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, 84.6% of capital expenditure (capex) was generated by business activities aligned with the EU taxonomy, compared with 84.7% in 2020.\n\nConsidering all retail electricity sales as 'non-eligible', 83.7 % of capital expenditure was aligned.\n\nThe percentage of the capital expenditure of taxonomy eligible-aligned activities in 2021 was in line with the previous year.\n\nThe  percentage  of  2021  capital  expenditure  for  eligible-aligned activities was 1.9% lower than the value of capital expenditure planned for 2021 in the 2021-2023 Strate-\n\ngic Plan for those activities. In absolute terms, the capital expenditure  of  taxonomy  eligible-aligned  activities  was greater than planned, primarily a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the greater-than-planned increase in expenditure to expand Group renewables capacity (an excess of \u20ac683 million). However, capital expenditure in eligible-not aligned activities and non-eligible activities was also greater (\u20ac412 million), notably for electricity transmission and distribution, the sale of energy not ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by guarantees of origin and thermal generation.",

These e/ff.ligaects were pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by greater tax pa/r\\_t.liganership gains (\u20ac42 million) recognized following the sta/r\\_t.liga-up of new plants by Enel No/r\\_t.ligah America, including Azure Blue Jay, Lily Solar, and Rochaven Ranchland.\n\nGross operating pro/fi.ligat amounted to \u20ac4,761 million (\u20ac4,647 million in 2020), re/fl.ligaecting provisions for charges in respect of the energy transition and digitalization (\u20ac47 million) and costs incurred in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic for workplace sanitization activities, personal protective equipment and donations (\u20ac7 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The rebound was made possible, especially in the more developed countries, by signi/fi.ligacant government /fi.ligascal suppo/r\\_t.liga and the rapid and e/ff.ligaective rollout of vaccination campaigns.\n\nHowever, the reopening of economic activity at the beginning of 2021 generated sharp imbalances between supply and demand on a global scale, causing severe disto/r\\_t.ligaions in supply chains and, consequently, pushing up the prices of raw materials and intermediate and consumer goods,\n\nIn the 2nd Half of 2021, US GDP, which increased by 5.7% year-on-year in the year as a whole, grew more slowly than anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn the euro area, the real economy posted a clear recovery in both the 2nd and 3rd Qua/r\\_t.ligaers of 2021, with annual GDP grown by 5.2%. However, the economic recovery slowed in the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer due to rapid increases in energy prices and a surge in Omicron-related COVID cases, which prompted many countries to reintroduce business closures and mobility restrictions.",

The Company has numerous innovation pa/r\\_t.liganership agreements that, in addition to Enel's traditional lines of business in the renewables and conventional generation sectors, have promoted the development of new solutions for e-mobility, microgrids, energy e/ffi.ligaciency and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nEnel's  innovation  strategy  leverages  the  online  crowdsourcing platform (openinnovability.com) and a global network of 10 Innovation Hubs (of which 3 are also Labs) and 22 Labs (of which 3 are dedicated to sta/r\\_t.ligaups), which consolidates the new model of collaboration with sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs. The la/t\\_t.ligaer o/ff.ligaer innovative solutions and new business models, and Enel makes its skills, testing facilities and a global network of pa/r\\_t.liganers available to suppo/r\\_t.liga their development and possible scale-up. The Hubs are located in the most impo/r\\_t.ligaant innovation ecosystems for the Group (Catania, Pisa, Milan, Silicon Valley, Boston, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Moscow, Santiago de Chile and Tel Aviv), they manage relationships with all the players involved in innovation activities and are the main source of scouting for innovative sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs. The Labs (among which those in Milan, Pisa, Catania, S\u00e3o Paulo, Tel Aviv and Be'er Sheva are the most representative) allow sta/r\\_t.ligaups to develop and test their solutions together with the Business Lines.\n\nIn 2021, thanks to the Group's stable positioning in innovative ecosystems and the extensive use of the Hub and Lab network, more than 90 scouting initiatives were launched (more than half of which in the form of vi/r\\_t.ligaual bootcamps) in various technological areas. This enabled Enel to meet more than 2,000 sta/r\\_t.ligaups and to begin more than 100 new collaborative relationships.\n\nThe  community  of  500,000  solvers  gave  Enel  a  global crowdsourcing presence in 2021 as well, with over 27 innovation and sustainability challenges launched on openinnovability.com.  In  2021,  Enel  reached  a  total  of  over 177 challenges launched since the platform was created, 44,000 users registered on the site (about 400,000 poten-\n\ntial solvers from pa/r\\_t.liganer platforms) and about \u20ac650,000 in monetary prizes paid to the winners.\n\nIn 2021, the integration of Open Innovation Culture and Agile Transformation was launched at the Group level with the  aim  of  providing  the  business  with  comprehensive suppo/r\\_t.liga, from the generation of the idea to the implementation of projects, using Innovation and Agile approaches as a key driver to create competitive advantage and optimize costs over time.\n\nEver increasing impo/r\\_t.ligaance is being taken on by activities to promote and develop the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship within the Company, through multiple initiatives such as the training of personnel in courses provided through the Innovation Academy (many of which are run with internal instructors), the project involving Innovation Ambassadors, who are people passionate about innovation and creativity who voluntarily dedicate pa/r\\_t.liga of their working time to suppo/r\\_t.liga activities in solving business challenges with a co-creative and innovative approach, and /fi.liganally the 'Make it Happen!' entrepreneurship project, a company contest in which employees can propose innovative business projects or process e/ffi.ligaciency projects directly to Company top management.\n\nDuring 2021, Enel also continued to implement We4U, the World energy 4 Universities pa/r\\_t.liganership program with national and international universities and research centers, with the aim of maintaining a constant and multidisciplinary dialogue focused on the challenges of the energy transition.\n\nThe activities of the innovation communities also continued, involving di/ff.ligaerent areas and skills within the Company. In addition to the existing communities addressing energy storage, blockchain, drones, augmented and vi/r\\_t.ligaual reality, additive  manufacturing,  a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial  intelligence,  wearables, robotics and green hydrogen, four other communities on sensors, materials, computer generative design and data monetization were added in 2021. While for the most cutting-edge technologies the role of the communities is exploratory, researching possible use cases and applications, others play a role in sharing and disseminating best practices that can enable technologies to scale and expand their impact on the business: this is the case of drones, with possibilities opened by regulatory developments concerning /fl.ligaights beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS), robotic solutions, especially in the /fi.ligaeld of legged-robots and autonomous missions, vi/r\\_t.ligaual and augmented reality and a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence applications.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In particular, the services provided by more than 20 sta/r\\_t.ligaups were analyzed and proof-of-concept activities were pe/r\\_f.ligaormed, some of which are still in progress while others have been internalized, addressing the issues summarized below.\n\nThe following technological areas were investigated:\n\n- \u00b7 speci/fi.ligac solutions for the protection of industrial sys-\n- \u00b7 cyber protection and detection services in the /fi.ligaeld of micro-services, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular for containers and serverless instances in the DevSecOps /fi.ligaeld;\n\n## Intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay\n\nContinuing the work done the previous year, in 2021 Enel redoubled its commitment to leveraging and developing its intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay po/r\\_t.ligafolio to ensure it serves as a source of competitive advantage for the Group.\n\nThe Open Innovability\u00ae ecosystem generates innovation through the creation and sharing of internal and external solutions that give life to ideas that enable the safe and sustainable  propagation  of  the  technological  solutions through which electri/fi.ligacation, platformization and stewardship programs are implemented, but which at the same time require appropriate forms of legal protection.\n\nThis  innovative  impulse  is  also  re/fl.ligaected  in  the  Group's investment in intangible assets, which show a signi/fi.ligacant increase,  in  line  with  the  strategic  direction  delineated above, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular regard to IT and digital applications. The investments focused on all the Group's Global Busi-\n\nness Lines and mainly concerned:\n\n- \u00b7 in the Global Infrastructure and Networks Global Business Line, the creation of platforms for the exploitation of network externalities in the service market, as well as for the automation of user management;\n- \u00b7 in the Global Thermal Generation Global Business Line, the development of innovative technical solutions in solar generation that seek, on the one hand, to create an innovative system for the rapid and automatable installation of photovoltaic panels and, on the other hand, to increase the photovoltaic output of plants by increasing charge transfer mechanisms at the micro and nanometric level in correspondence with di/ff.ligaerent layers both in single and heterojunction cells and in tandem systems;\n- tems (OT), which owing to their scope of applicability often have low computational capacity and are linked to legacy systems;\n- \u00b7 solutions that exploit the greater potential of a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence and machine learning, helping to enhance capabilities for the detection of cyber threats and the automation of analysis, correlation and response to incidents;\n- \u00b7 services for identifying vulnerabilities in third-pa/r\\_t.ligay assets and services used by the organization that can undermine the security of the organization itself (external a/t\\_t.ligaack su/r\\_f.ligaace);\n- \u00b7 solutions to identify the vulnerabilities of assets and devices (mobile devices, IoT, web applications, etc) with the use of innovative techniques;\n- \u00b7 services that enable analysis of the /fi.ligarmware of IoT devices within a few hours and the rapid identi/fi.ligacation of key  vulnerabilities,  optimizing  execution  times  compared with manual processes.\n- \u00b7 in the Enel X Global Business Line, the development of applications in the telemedicine business and platforms in urban livability /fi.ligaeld, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular regard, respectively, to the Sma/r\\_t.liga Axistance eWell App, designed and operated in collaboration with leading specialists at the Policlinico Gemelli Foundation, and to the 15 Minutes City Index platform, developed in collaboration with the University of Florence;\n- \u00b7 in the new e-Mobility Global Business Line, the de/fi.liganition of forms of protection for its solutions in electric charging, including the community design to protect Juice Media, an innovative product which enables the simultaneous o/ff.ligaer of electric charging and multimedia adve/r\\_t.ligaising services in a single structure.\n\nThe Group is also investing resources in the development of innovative solutions for protecting its intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay, mainly in the forms of copyright protection and trade secrets, concerning climate models and advanced quantitative models for the analysis of energy systems in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation in the main geographical areas in which we operate, using an integrated and future-oriented vision.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Group had applied for 892 for patents in 146 technological families. Of these, 749 have been granted and 143 are pending. The po/r\\_t.ligafolio ensures protection in all the markets in which the Group is present.

The Group also intends to continue to suppo/r\\_t.liga and encourage\n\nthe development of its innovation model through speci/fi.ligac projects for internal dissemination by the Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay unit. In this regard, in 2021 a new Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay Management procedure was introduced and management repo/r\\_t.ligaing tools were developed to enhance the sharing of information on the value generated within Enel through the  Open  Innovability\u00ae  model.  For  more  information, please see the section on intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay in the Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\n## The new Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay Management procedure\n\nThe management of the Group's intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay is governed by the new Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay Management procedure. It comprises all stages of the life of intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay, from the moment of conception of inventions to that of protecting and maintaining the po/r\\_t.ligafolio and relationships with external counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the procedure governs cases in which the intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay generated within Enel is transferred externally in circumstances such as: (i) collaborative research; (ii) procurement;\n\n(iii) relations with sta/r\\_t.ligaups; (iv) mergers, acquisitions and stewardship operations; and (v) the outright or licensed acquisitions of intangible assets of Enel and third pa/r\\_t.ligaies. The methods for protecting intangible assets, monitoring their use, and metrics for measuring the Group's pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  in  the  management  of  intellectual  prope/r\\_t.ligay  are regulated within this procedure, tracing information of use in the future planning and leveraging assets and mapping risks.\n\n## The Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay Repo/r\\_t.ligaing project\n\nSta/r\\_t.ligaing in 2020, Enel has set itself the challenge - commonly felt but not de/fi.liganitively absorbed into corporate practices  in  the  various  global  technology  companies - of accurately representing its intellectual assets in its non-/fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing. This prompted us to /fi.ligarst undertake a quantitative and qualitative survey of our existing assets, systematizing both legally protected assets (patents, designs, utility models) and trade secrets. In 2021, Enel laid the foundations for the de/fi.liganition of an internal non-/fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing process for intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay, based on a proprietary methodology designed to lend continuity from year to year to valuing and leveraging our intangible asset resources, pa/r\\_t.ligaly with a view to future external repo/r\\_t.ligaing.\n\nThe  process  is  applicable  to  all  internal  Enel  projects that are intended to generate intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay and is based on the necessary and preventive identi/fi.ligacation of the various components which a project may generate, such as, among other things, documentation, technology, algorithms, processes, products, layouts, schemes and  dashboards.  Each  identi/fi.ligaed  intangible  element  is matched with one or more forms of intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay right in order to measure the intensity of the project's output in terms of intellectual content. The internal\n\nmethodology also envisages an exercise to evaluate the intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay generated internally, which, while not intending in any way to replace other valuation methods adopted within the Enel Group for determining fair value based on income methods, makes it possible to assess the intrinsic value of these intangibles on the basis of /fi.liganancial factors and providing an indication of the investment that would be necessary to replicate the technological solution being evaluated.\n\nAt an experimental level, a number of projects that have contributed  to  the  generation  of  intellectual  property within the Enel Group were selected from within the Global  Business  Lines,  the  Global  Service  Functions and the sta/ff.liga functions for a more detailed analysis of the problems arising from the application of this qualitative-quantitative methodology. The methodology was tested and pe/r\\_f.ligaected with these projects on the basis of empirical experience and taking account of the speci/fi.ligac technical and organizational features of the various areas. More speci/fi.ligacally, the most interesting practical applications of the Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay Repo/r\\_t.ligaing methodology include Grid Blue Sky, a /fl.ligaagship project of the Global Infrastructure and Networks Business Line (mentioned in the 2020 Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga), and the intangibles of\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "the 3SUN factory, which is involved in the manufacture of bi-facial heterojunction solar panels based on proprietary Enel technology.\n\nThe Grid Blue Sky project seeks to re-engineer the operating model used for grids with a view to the integrated management of all operations, from design and planning to operation and maintenance, interaction with customers and the suppo/r\\_t.liga of new business models adopted by distributors, all in such a way that the various functions are natively compatible with the various aspects of the operating environment, including the regulatory factors typical of energy markets. Grid Blue Sky is based on an innovative development paradigm, which makes its architecture scalable, sustainable and resilient, being based on  the  idea  that  all  the  activities  of  an  operator  take place through access to a single integrated platform on which the data converge. This avoids the need to develop redundant ve/r\\_t.ligaical solutions, because the database is shared and opens up the possibility of developing countless  services  or  integrating  third-pa/r\\_t.ligay  solutions.  The platform includes the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 the asset operator, which concerns the management of grid operation and maintenance processes;\n- \u00b7 the asset owner, which concerns everything related to the planning and development of the power grid;\n- \u00b7 customer engagement, which handles interaction with customers, who will thus bene/fi.ligat from a single platform for interaction and relationship management; and\n- \u00b7 the system operator, which looks to the future of electricity distribution, examining as yet unregulated perspectives concerning the use of the /fl.ligaexibility o/ff.ligaered by grid-connected resources to solve congestion and voltage regulation issues.\n\nThe  examination  of  the  project  using  the  Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay Repo/r\\_t.ligaing methodology made it possible to identify the various intangible components that combine to form the platform and con/fi.ligarmed the considerable intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay density of Grid Blue Sky. The search for a correspondence between intangible components and forms of protection - which is pa/r\\_t.liga of the methodology inaugurated by Enel - reveals the presence of a copyright on all the source code underpinning the platform and on all aspects of conceptual design and the infor-\n\nmation /fl.ligaows at the basis of the operating model, as well as copyright over all the original graphic elements (user inte/r\\_f.ligaaces and data access dashboards). Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in application of the internal procedure governing the protection of trade secrets, all the con/fi.ligadential components underlying Enel's great know-how in managing the grid and which are expressed in technological, organizational, economic, /fi.liganancial and marketing aspects have been identi/fi.ligaed, isolated and codi/fi.ligaed.\n\nSimilarly, the exercise of codifying intangible assets and identifying forms of protection was conducted for Enel Green Power's 3SUN factory, which conceives and develops  new-generation  photovoltaic  applications.  Enel has long been at the forefront in the design of bi-facial heterojunction solar panels, which increase the e/ffi.ligaciency of systems thanks to their greater capacity for capturing solar radiation. 3SUN's know-how in this area does not only involve the panel as such, but also the innovative materials used, the assembly methods, as well as all the industrial knowledge behind the construction and automated management (from an Industry 4.0 perspective) of production lines. The codi/fi.ligacation of intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay for 3SUN identi/fi.ligaed all the technological components and related forms of protection, which involve a broad group of patent families for the processes implemented, the materials used and the heterojunction techniques used to manufacture panels, as well as a considerable volume of con/fi.ligadential knowledge, adequately identi/fi.ligaed and protected, necessary to make the panels, and speci/fi.ligac production know-how that directly concerns the realization of all the components of the Gigafactory.\n\nThe cases of Grid Blue Sky and 3SUN are emblematic of the assiduous work that Enel has been pursuing for some years now to make it increasingly visible to the outside world  how  intellectual  prope/r\\_t.ligay  is  instrumental  to  the generation  and  preservation  of  the  Company's  competitive advantage, both in cases of direct and internal exploitation of technological solutions (as in the case of 3SUN) or where proprietary oversight is instrumental to sharing knowledge in a context of open innovation and enabling new business models (as in the case of Grid Blue Sky).",

In  2021,  remote  working  was used by more than 39 thousand employees in the countries in which the Group operates. This capacity for /fl.ligaexibility and resilience leverages our consolidated experience with /fl.ligaexible working, which began in Italy as early as 2016 and then gradually spread throughout the Group, and the technological and digital transformation of corporate strategy that has made Enel the /fi.ligarst public utility completely resident in the cloud.\n\nThe new approach to work has bene/fi.ligated from the numerous tools and suppo/r\\_t.liga services made available to our people, an essential prerequisite for working from home, ensuring the circulation and sharing of information and the e/ff.ligaective organization of activities. Training and awareness-raising initiatives continue to accompany the adoption of fully digital working methods and the promotion of a work culture based on independence, delegation and trust, and a/t\\_t.ligaention to the well-being of our people and their families.\n\nIn this context, the targeted reskilling and upskilling programs\n\nhave therefore been strengthened, the former to learn skills and expe/r\\_t.ligaise that enable people to /fi.ligall new positions and roles, while the la/t\\_t.ligaer involve the development of training and empowerment courses that enable employees to improve their pe/r\\_f.ligaormance in their job, increasing the skills available to them in their current position.\n\nDuring 2021, dissemination e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas concerning upskilling and reskilling issues were launched with the involvement of all the Group's countries and Business Lines: these included a global challenge and 36 interviews with senior executives on current and future skills. A working group was also formed to draft guidelines and map projects, adopting a common taxonomy in which upskilling, reskilling and external skilling are considered as an integrated set of initiatives that include training, development and the Enel ecosystem as a whole.\n\nEuropean networking on upskilling and reskilling issues was expanded by joining the Upskill4the future initiative of CSR Europe with the People Business Pa/r\\_t.liganer R-evolution project of e-distribuzione, targeted at People Business Pa/r\\_t.liganers, the /fi.ligarst facilitators of the energy transition in accompanying people along their professional growth path, who contributed to\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have developed career paths to foster the evolution of our talent, the valorization of passions and personal aptitude and the development of new languages, also promoting the formation of internal trainers ('train the trainer'). In 2021, some 3 million\n\nhours of training were provided, an increase compared with the previous year, with 20% provided in person and the remainder delivered remotely. This was made possible by the upgrading of digital tools and the E-Ducation platform, which ensured broad access to content and expanded the culture of digitalization for learning. The training courses covered issues related to conduct, technical issues, safety, new skills and digital culture.\n\nTotal Group training costs in 2021 amounted to \u20ac23 million.

The program, which involves 100% of the Group's eligible  employees,  has  signi/fi.ligacant  distinctive  features compared with past iterations. More speci/fi.ligacally, in order to forge a constant dialogue between and with people, the evaluation has been made continuous and omni-com-\n\nprehensive, with three moments of communication between managers and personnel during the year. The new OFE model consists of three interdependent dimensions: 'Talent', which consists in highlighting a worker's individual skills based on the 15 Soft Skills Model linked to the 4 Open Power values of Trust, Responsibility, Innovation and Proactivity; 'Generosity', understood as an aptitude to enter into relationships with others, dedicating time to recognizing the talents of colleagues and in turn ge/t\\_t.ligaing involved by requesting feedback on one's own pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, generating a mechanism for individual and collective growth; and, /fi.liganally, 'Action', i.e., the ability of employees to achieve professional goals, as assessed by their managers.\n\n## Listening and improvement of organizational well-being\n\nFollowing earlier initiatives conducted by Enel to ensure we are constantly listening to our people, which over the years have led to the development of speci/fi.ligac action plans for individual holding functions, Business Lines and geographical areas, producing answers to the main needs that  emerged  from  the  process  (meritocracy,  personal development, work-life balance, etc.), at the end of 2020 a global 'Open Listening - interview to build our future' program was launched. This global initiative, which saw the\n\nactive pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation of 70% of employees, provided important feedback on the internal climate but also on working conditions, asking our people to imagine the future in the 'Next Normal' era: from remote working methods to spaces, innovative technologies and the new leadership models of the future.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, during 2021 Enel and our people also developed a global well-being model based on eight pillars that impact general satisfaction: psychological, physical,",

In 2019, the Global Workplace Harassment Policy was published. It sets out the principle of respect for the integrity and dignity of the individual in the workplace and addresses the issue of sexual harassment and harassment connected with discrimination in the workplace. In 2020, these principles were delineated in the Statement against Harassment. Finally, with a focus on the inclusion of everyone and with a view to ensuring equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for access to information and digital systems, a global digital accessibility policy was issued in 2021.\n\nOur approach to diversity and inclusion is based on the principles of non-discrimination, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, dignity and inclusion of every person regardless of di/ff.ligaerences, and work-life balance. It is embodied in a comprehensive set of actions that promote the care and expression of the uniqueness of each person, an inclusive and prejudice-free organizational culture, and a coherent mix of skills, qualities and experiences that create value for people and the business.\n\nAmong the most impo/r\\_t.ligaant initiatives pursued in 2021 are dedicated actions to systematically impact the various aspects of the gender gap and the inclusion of disability, the speci/fi.ligac listening and suppo/r\\_t.liga services made available to people in the context of the pandemic emergency, projects dedicated to people with vulnerabilities, awareness-raising initiatives on LGBTQ+ issues and cultural diversity.\n\nIn recent years, an intense awareness-raising e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga has\n\nmost valuable and distinctive of the Group: the 'Employer Value Proposition Survey'. Thanks to this project, which involved employees from around the world, a Net Promoter Score - an indicator measuring the employee satisfaction - was also analyzed, assessing the main a/t\\_t.ligaributes associated with the Enel brand in its position as an 'employer of choice'. Sustainability, innovation, safety at work and worklife balance are the main a/t\\_t.ligaributes that emerged, factors that also match the main preferences declared by people when they choose where they want to work.\n\nhelped spread and strengthen the culture of inclusion at every level and in every organizational context, using communication  campaigns  and  dedicated  global  and  local events. In 2021, two global awareness campaigns on workplace bias and harassment were launched for all employees.\n\nThe  progress  of  D&I  policies  is  monitored  periodically through a global repo/r\\_t.ligaing process that measures the performance of an extensive set of KPIs on all dimensions for internal and external purposes. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, with regard to gender, Enel has set itself two public objectives: to ensure equal balance of the two genders in the initial stages of the selection processes and to increase the representation of women in senior and middle management. In 2021, women represented 52.1% of people involved in the selection process, an increase on 2020 (44%), while women accounted for 23.6% of senior managers (21.6% in 2020) and 31.4% of middle managers (30.4% in 2020).\n\nWith this in mind, a new pe/r\\_f.ligaormance target in the 2021 Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  has  been  introduced,  with  a weight equal to 5% of the total, represented by the 'percentage of women in management succession plans' at the end of 2023.\n\nThis represents an objective for all managers of Enel and/ or its subsidiaries, including the General Manager (as well as Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer) of Enel, who hold top positions and/or positions of strategic interest for the Group. It also underscores the strong commitment of the Enel Group to ensuring equal representation of women in the areas that feed management succession plans and emphasizes the increasing a/t\\_t.ligaention being paid to the issue of gender equality.\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of the Value for Disability project, the actions envisaged in the associated action plan continued with the issuance of a global policy on digital accessibility and numerous awareness-raising initiatives aimed at spreading a new approach to the inclusion of colleagues with disabilities and promoting their e/ff.ligaective pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation.

We are therefore commi/t\\_t.ligaed to developing  and  promoting  a  strong  culture  of  safety  that ensures a healthy work environment and protection for all those working with and for the Group. Safeguarding our own health and safety and that of the people with whom we interact is the responsibility of everyone who works for Enel. For this reason, as provided for in the Group 'Stop Work Policy', everyone is required to promptly repo/r\\_t.liga and halt any situation of risk or unsafe behavior. The constant commitment of us all, the integration of safety both in corporate processes and training, the repo/r\\_t.ligaing and detailed analysis of all information, near misses, safety warnings, non-compliance, controls, rigor in the selection and management of contractors, the sharing of experience and best practices throughout the Group as well as benchmarking against the leading international players are all cornerstones of Enel's culture of safety. During 2021, the 'Data Driven Safety' approach was fu/r\\_t.ligaher developed. It seeks to develop 'selective prevention' safety indicators that help identify the country, technology and area at greatest risk of fatal events in order to direct prevention and protection interventions for internal employees and contractors.\n\nThe Group's approach to suppliers is to consider each of them as a pa/r\\_t.liganer with whom the key principles of safety and the environment are to be shared. These include the Zero Accidents goal and the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of the Stop Work Policy, tools that make it possible to promptly repo/r\\_t.liga and halt any situation of risk that could harm people or the environment. At all stages, from quali/fi.ligacation to contract award, the Group has adopted speci/fi.ligac tools to monitor the management of Health, Safety and Environmental requirements. Accurate monitoring is associated with a continuous process of on-site inspections and consequence management, de/fi.liganed on the basis of the supplier's safety and environmental risk pro/fi.ligale, with a view to improving pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\nIn addition, during 2021 the Contractor Safety Pa/r\\_t.liganership program continued. It is based on sharing Enel's core values for safety. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Safety Suppo/r\\_t.liga process proposes lines of improvement and internal experience is made available to suppliers to suppo/r\\_t.liga the training of contractor sta/ff.liga, while  keeping  the  responsibilities  of  the  contractor  well separated from Enel.\n\nEnel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to increasing safety and environmental skills both in terms of technical know-how and cultural approach, all with a view to promoting a new way of working that is safer for people and more sustainable for the envi-\n\notherwise, the e/ff.ligaects of which will be fully appreciable in the medium/long term, taking due account of generational dynamics.\n\nThe following table demonstrates Enel's commitment to diversity and inclusion, showing the propo/r\\_t.ligaion of disabled personnel, the number of women in senior or middle management positions and the ratio of the average basic remuneration of women to that for men.",

With this in mind, the Group conducts global and local awareness campaigns to promote  healthy  lifestyles,  sponsors  screening  programs aimed at preventing the onset of diseases and guarantees\n\nthe provision of medical services. The Enel Group has a systematic and ongoing process for identifying and assessing work-related stress risks, in accordance with the Stress at Work Prevention and Well-being at Work Promotion policy, for the prevention, identi/fi.ligacation and management of stress in work situations, also providing recommendations aimed at promoting a culture of organizational well-being. In 2021, the Enel Group focused on strengthening the measures and programs targeting well-being issues, which are increasingly vital in ensuring not only the well-being of its workers in the context of a pandemic but also looking to the future and to new ways of working.\n\nThe  Group  also  constantly  monitors  epidemiological  and health developments in order to implement preventive and protective measures for the health of employees and those who work with the Group, both locally and globally. Since the outset of the COVID-19 emergency in February 2020, Enel has taken steps to protect the health of all workers and ensure the continuity of electricity supply to the communities in which it operates, primarily by se/t\\_t.ligaing up speci/fi.ligac global and country task forces and, subsequently, establishing a\n\n<!-- image -->",

This, together with devoting unswerving a/t\\_t.ligaention to social and environmental factors, has enabled Enel, on the one hand, to implement a new balanced model of equitable development that leaves no one behind and, on the other, to create long-term shared value for all stakeholders.\n\nThis model has been incorporated along the entire value chain: from proactive analysis of the needs of communities right from the development phases of new business to the establishment of sustainable worksites and plants, managing assets and plants to make them sustainable development platforms to the bene/fi.ligat of the territories in which they are located. A fu/r\\_t.ligaher evolution is the extension of this approach to the design, development and supply of energy services and products, as well as process innovation, leveraging new technologies and helping to build increasingly circular, inclusive and sustainable communities.\n\nIn line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Enel makes a concrete contribution to the sustainable progress of the territories in which it operates. This commitment is fully integrated into our purpose and corporate values, from the expansion of infrastructure to education and vocational training programs, and projects to suppo/r\\_t.liga cultural and economic activities. Speci/fi.ligac initiatives have been designed to promote access to energy and rural and suburban electri/fi.ligacation, addressing energy pove/r\\_t.ligay and promoting social inclusion for the most vulnerable segments of the population, also using new technologies and circular economy approaches and adopting a strategy that fully incorporates sustainability into our business model and activities. Various initiatives have been developed globally for the protection of biodiversity, in line with the Group's decarbonization strategy. There are two major challenges in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular: the equitable and sustainable energy transition and the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nThe energy transition represents an impo/r\\_t.ligaant accelerator of growth and modernization of industry, thanks to the potential it o/ff.ligaers in terms of economic development, well-being, quality of life and equality. Far-sighted policies are necessary to seize these oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, ensuring a just and inclusive transition and taking pa/r\\_t.ligaicular account of the needs of the social categories most exposed to change. Enel is convinced that, in order to generate lasting pro/fi.ligat, value must be shared with the entire environment in which it operates.\n\nWith the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, our commitment to suppo/r\\_t.liga communities has also continued, with the activation of speci/fi.ligac initiatives to sustain socio-economic recovery through the development of local marketplaces, facilitating access to credit and promoting inclusive business models to suppo/r\\_t.liga the weaker segments of the population, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular a/t\\_t.ligaention to people in physically, socially and economically vulnerable positions. Many digitalization projects have also been unde/r\\_t.ligaaken to suppo/r\\_t.liga connectivity in rural areas, computer literacy, the pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation of women in STEM /fi.ligaelds, e-commerce  platforms  and  online  or  o/ffl.ligaine  solutions with a positive impact on local economies.\n\nIn 2021, Enel developed over 2,400 sustainability projects involving more than 7.5 million bene/fi.ligaciaries in the countries in which it operates. Projects to ensure access to a/ff.ligaordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG 7) have involved 13.2 million people to date, (19) those to foster the economic and social development of communities (SDG 8) have reached 3.7 million bene/fi.ligaciaries, (20) while  initiatives  to  promote  quality  education  (SDG  4) have bene/fi.ligated 3 million people. (21)\n\nIn order to identify the best ideas for each area, the process involves sharing with local communities and listening to stakeholders, leading to the identi/fi.ligacation of e/ff.ligaective measures to respond to local needs in synergy with company objectives.",

        "page_content": "The ideas that emerged from stakeholder engagement and constant dialogue with communities represent the basis for the construction of long-term pa/r\\_t.liganerships with the active involvement of non-governmental organizations and sta/r\\_t.ligaups, companies and institutions rooted in the territory. An approach that leads to the implementation of a wide range of projects in di/ff.ligaerent areas, thanks in  pa/r\\_t.liga  to  the  activation  of  vi/r\\_t.ligauous  ecosystems  such\n\nas the Open Innovability\u00ae platform, which is based on openness  and  sharing,  facilitating  and  promoting  the identi/fi.ligacation of innovative social ideas and solutions. In 2021, over 580 pa/r\\_t.liganerships were active at an international level, fostered in pa/r\\_t.liga by a range of tools such as, for example, crowdsourcing platforms (openinnovability. com) and the Innovation Hub network.\n\n## Sustainable supply chain\n\nIn addition to meeting ce/r\\_t.ligaain quality standards, the services of our vendors must also go hand in hand with the adoption of best practices in terms of human rights and working conditions, health and safety and environmental and  ethical  responsibility.  Our  procurement  procedures are designed to guarantee service quality in full respect of the principles of economy, e/ff.ligaectiveness, timeliness, fairness and transparency. The procurement process plays a central role in value creation in its various forms (safety, savings,  timeliness,  quality,  earnings,  revenue,  /fl.ligaexibility) as a result of ever-greater interaction and integration with the outside world and the di/ff.ligaerent pa/r\\_t.ligas of the company organization. About 6,900 quali/fi.ligaed suppliers had an active contract in place at the end of 2021.\n\nVendor  management  involves  three  essential  stages, which  integrate  social,  environmental  and  governance issues: the quali/fi.ligacation system, the de/fi.liganition of general terms and conditions of contract, and the Supplier Performance  Management  (SPM)  system  in  the  evaluation process.  Enel's  global  vendor  quali/fi.ligacation  system  (with about 14,000 active quali/fi.ligacations at December 31, 2021) enables us to accurately assess businesses that intend to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in tender processes through the analysis of compliance with technical, /fi.liganancial, legal, environmental, health and safety, human and ethical rights and integrity requirements, representing a guarantee for the Company. As regards the tendering and bargaining process, Enel continued to introduce aspects related to sustainability in tendering processes, not only with the introduction of a speci/fi.ligac 'K for sustainability' factor, but also through the use of mandatory sustainability requirements that take ac-\n\ncount of the environmental, social and safety characteristics of suppliers. To facilitate the application and monitoring of these requirements, in 2021 the /fi.ligarst version of the sustainability  requirements  library  was  implemented  on the WeBUY purchasing po/r\\_t.ligaal, a coded list of sustainability actions that buyers can apply as mandatory requirements in the tender phase. In the early months of 2021, all the standards (Product Category Rules) necessary to obtain the 'Environmental Product Declaration' were published. This ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation seeks to quantify, ce/r\\_t.ligaify and communicate the impacts generated during the entire life cycle of a supply relationship (in terms of CO 2 emissions, water consumption, impact on the soil, recycled material, etc.). This process enables us to obtain a sector benchmark and de/fi.ligane improvement plans with the suppliers involved (more than 200 in 13 strategic product categories that account for some 50% of the Group's annual spending on supplies). Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, speci/fi.ligac contractual clauses regarding sustainability are also envisaged in all contracts for works, services and supplies, including respect for and protection of human rights and compliance with ethical and social obligations.

Enel X is marketing itself as an accelerator of the circularity of its customers, both by continuously measuring and improving its products and services and by providing measurement and consulting services to customers to increase their circularity.\n\nSince the initial stages of adopting a circular approach, Enel has placed a strong focus on measuring the environmental and economic bene/fi.ligats of circularity, with the awareness that a model that exceeds and, ideally, eliminates the consumption of non-renewable resources must be measurable in order to be not only sustainable but also economically competitive. Since the 2020 Capital Markets Day, for example, the Group has introduced a new circularity indicator for generation assets, supplementing existing indicators on direct emissions. This additional indicator photographs the evolution over the years of the consumption of materials per MWh generated on a whole life basis, measuring the consumption of materials throughout the\n\nlife cycle: from production to installation, to decommissioning of generation assets.\n\nA business model based on circularity requires maximum collaboration between all key players: this is why Enel considers it essential to open lines of communication and collaboration with those who share this vision, involving supply chains and promoting common initiatives (including training) to safeguard natural resources and increase the competitiveness of a country.\n\nFinally, in the belief that the transition to a circular economy will generate multiple economic, social and environmental bene/fi.ligats, we believe that Group /fi.liganance can play a key role in accelerating this transition by providing /fi.liganancial assistance to companies and projects that implement circular business models, suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the development of the new innovative technologies necessary to enable the functioning of new circular business models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 128 MW Unit I was disconnected three years before the date set in Chile's National Decarbonization Plan. With this milestone, coupled with the closure of Tarapac\u00e1 coal plant on December 31, 2019 and the expected closure of Enel's last coal facility in the country, Bocamina's Unit II, by May 2022, steady progress is being made towards the decarbonization of Enel's Chilean generation mix.\n\n## Moody's upgrades Enel's long-term rating to 'Baa1'\n\nOn January 15, 2021, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) announced  that  it  had  upgraded  its  long-term  rating of Enel SpA to 'Baa1' from the previous level of 'Baa2'.

The O/ff.ligaer was structured as a voluntary public tender o/ff.ligaer in the United States and a voluntary public tender o/ff.ligaer in Chile. The Offer period ran from March 15 to April 13, 2021. The O/ff.ligaer was conditional upon the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the merger of EGP Am\u00e9ricas SpA into Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA, which occurred on April 1, 2021. The total outlay of 1,065.2 billion Chilean pesos (equal to around \u20ac1.3 billion, calculated at the exchange rate prevailing on April 15, 2021 of 847.87 Chilean pesos for 1 euro) was funded through internally generated cash /fl.ligaows and existing borrowing capacity.

On May 5, 2019, Celg-D /fi.ligaled an ordinary petition and a request for a precautionary suspension against the state of Goi\u00e1s to contest this law. On September 16, 2019, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s denied the petition for precautionary relief, citing the absence of any danger in delay, a requirement for the granting of precautionary relief. On September 26, 2019, Celg-D /fi.ligaled an appeal ( agravo de instrumento ) before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s  against  the  decision  denying  the  precautionary suspension, claiming that the repeal of the tax credit law is unconstitutional to the extent that these credits were established in accordance with applicable law and constitute acquired rights. On September 7, 2020, the state of Goi\u00e1s submi/t\\_t.ligaed its reply to the precautionary petition /fi.ligaled with the appeal. With measure issued at the hearing of July 20, 2021, and subsequently con/fi.ligarmed on September 17, 2021, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s denied the precautionary relief requested by Celg-D.\n\nMoreover, the Brazilian association of electricity distribution companies (ABRADEE) had /fi.ligaled an action for a ruling on constitutionality with the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brazil ( Supremo Tribunal Federal ) with regard to Laws 20416\n\nand 20468. This was denied on June 3, 2020 with an individual Decision by the judge-rappo/r\\_t.ligaeur for lack of formal requirements. On June 24, 2020, the ABRADEE /fi.ligaled an appeal ( agravo regimental ) against that decision. On September 21, 2020, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brazil, without going into the merits of the case, rejected ABRADEE's appeal for formal reasons and the proceeding was concluded. On October 15, 2020, ABRADEE /fi.ligaled an appeal against this decision. On March 8, 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga denied ABRADEE's appeal and the decision became /fi.liganal on April 5, 2021.\n\n## Closure of La Spezia coal-/fi.ligared plant\n\nOn December 2, 2021, Enel received /fi.liganal authorization from Italy's Ministry for the Ecological Transition for the de/fi.liganitive closure of the coal-/fi.ligared plant at the 'Eugenio Montale' thermoelectric power facility of La Spezia.\n\n## Hybrid bonds\n\nOn December 16, 2021, the Board of Directors of Enel SpA authorized Enel to issue, by December 31, 2022, one or more non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible subordinated hybrid bonds, including perpetual bonds, in the maximum amount of up to \u20ac3 billion. These bonds are to be placed exclusively with European and non-European institutional investors, including through private placements. The Board of Directors also revoked the previous resolution of February 25, 2021, concerning the issue of one or more bonds by the Company, for the po/r\\_t.ligaion not yet implemented, amounting to about \u20ac0.75 billion, without prejudice to all e/ff.ligaects arising from issues already carried out.\n\n## Criminal proceedings connected with Pietra/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaa plant - Italy\n\nWith regard to the Pietra/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaa thermal generation plant, the Perugia Public Prosecutor had sta/r\\_t.ligaed an investigation involving a number of o/ffi.ligacers of Enel Produzione SpA, as well as ce/r\\_t.ligaain third pa/r\\_t.ligaies who are today owners of the land adjacent to the plant - formerly Enel's - on which ash was found.\n\nThe alleged o/ff.ligaenses are as follows: failure to restore the site (A/r\\_t.ligaicle 452terdecies of the Italian Criminal Code) for a number of areas a/ff.ligaected by the spillage of ash produced up to the 1980s by the Pietra/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaa power plant and ash from other company plants, and other areas where contamination  with  polychlorinated  biphenyls  ('PCBs') was  found  associated  with  decommissioned  mining equipment;  environmental  pollution  (A/r\\_t.ligaicle  452-bis  of the Criminal Code) connected with the PCB contamina-",

Accordingly,  the  criminal  proceedings  are  continuing with sole regard to the crime of failure to restore the site, with respect to which in December 2019 the Enel Produzione SpA employees presented an application for a stay of proceedings with probation, consisting in the implementation of a program agreed with the Prosecutor's O/ffi.ligace for propo/r\\_t.ligaionate and fair restoration with respect to the complaints /fi.ligaled against the defendants. The probation hearing was held on October 29, 2020, when the investigating magistrate of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Perugia granted the request for probation. The hearing was then postponed to February 18, 2021, when the program proposed by Enel Produzione was approved, se/t\\_t.ligaing a deadline of nine months for its execution.\n\nAt a hearing on December 16, 2021, the judge, after considerable discussion, veri/fi.ligaed the compliance of the program and dismissed the charges as a consequence of the positive outcome of the probationary activities.\n\n## EIB and Enel agree a \u20ac120 million sustainability-linked loan for the energy transition in Italy\n\nOn December 20, 2021, Enel and the European Investment Bank (EIB) agreed a sustainability-linked loan of \u20ac120 million to suppo/r\\_t.liga the energy transition in Italy. The EIB loan to Enel Italia is pa/r\\_t.liga of the bank's sustainability-linked loan program connected with Enel's achievement of the objective of reducing direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1), in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 'Climate Action' and with the Group's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework.\n\n## Enel renews pa/r\\_t.liganership with Cinven in U/fi.liganet Latam\n\nOn December 21, 2021, Enel SpA, acting through Enel X International Srl, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enel X Srl, signed a new agreement with a holding company controlled by Sixth Cinven Fund and a holding company controlled by Seventh Cinven Fund - both funds managed by the international private equity company Cinven - for the indirect purchase, through a holding company, of about 79% of the capital of U/fi.liganet Latam SLU by Sixth Cinven Fund  for  \u20ac1,320  million  and  the  simultaneous  sale  of 80.5% of the company's capital to Seventh Cinven Fund for around \u20ac1,240 million, in order to renew the existing pa/r\\_t.liganership  in  U/fi.liganet.  Enel  X  International  will  simultaneously receive some \u20ac140 million through the U/fi.liganet's available reserves, a /fi.ligagure subject to potential adjustments at closing.\n\nUnder this agreement, Enel X International will therefore retain an indirect investment of 19.5% in U/fi.liganet, while the Seventh Cinven Fund will hold the remaining 80.5%.\n\n## Hydroelectric concessions - Italy\n\nItalian  regulations  governing  large-scale  hydroelectric concessions were most recently modi/fi.ligaed by the 'Simpli/fi.ligacations Decree' (Decree Law 135 of 2018 rati/fi.ligaed with Law 12 of February 11, 2019), which introduced a series of innovations regarding the granting of such concessions upon their expiry and the valorization of the assets and works connected to them to be transferred to the new concession holder. This legislation also introduced a number of changes in the ma/t\\_t.ligaer of concession fees, establishing a /fi.ligaxed and variable component of fees, as well as an obligation to provide free power to public bodies (220 kWh of power for each kW of average nominal capacity of the facilities covered by the concession). In implementation of this national law and under speci/fi.ligac enabling authority, various regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna,  Friuli-Venezia  Giulia,  the  Province  of Trento, Calabria and Basilicata) enacted regional laws.\n\nIn the view of Enel Green Power Italy and Enel Produzione, both the national law and the regional implementing legislation violate Community principles and constitutional principles such as prope/r\\_t.ligay rights, the principle of legal ce/r\\_t.ligaainty, the principle of propo/r\\_t.ligaionality and legitimate expectations and the freedom of enterprise.

The price consists of \u20ac220 million for the equity and a variable component linked to a price adjustment mechanism at closing. At the same time, Intesa Sanpaolo will pay between \u20ac88 million and \u20ac94 million at closing.

The /fi.ligarst delegated act establishing the technical screening criteria for around 60 economic activities, including the generation of electricity from photovoltaic,  wind,  hydroelectric  and  geothermal  resources and distribution, was published by the European Commis-\n\nsion in June 2021 and entered force in January 2022.\n\nOn  December  31,  2021,  the  Commission  sent  Member States a draft complementary delegated act for consultation, se/t\\_t.ligaing out a number of conditions for fossil gas and nuclear power to be classi/fi.ligaed as transitional activities aligned with the taxonomy. Some activities in which Enel is engaged, such as retail and trading, are not covered by the taxonomy so far.\n\n## Proposed legislation in consultation with /fi.liganancial impacts in 2021\n\nOn July 14, 2021, the European Commission published the 'Fit for 55' (FF55) package, which is a series of proposals that seek to reduce net emissions within the European Union by 55% by 2030 compared with their 1990 levels.\n\n## Renewable Energy Directive (RED II)\n\nAmong the proposed changes to current EU energy legislation, the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive plays a leading role, given that a much larger share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of the Member States will also be necessary to achieve the new climate objectives. The European Commission proposal establishes a framework for the deployment of renewables in all sectors of the economy, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular a/t\\_t.ligaention to sectors where progress has been slow (transpo/r\\_t.liga, buildings and industry). Among the key points of the revision is an increase in the minimum binding share of renewables in /fi.liganal energy consumption in the EU to 40% by 2030, e/ff.ligaectively doubling the share of RES in the energy mix over the course of just one decade (2021-2030). This 40% target is signi/fi.ligacantly higher than that agreed in the previous revision of the directive in 2018 (32%) and is suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by higher EU and national targets, including: a new target of 49% for renewable energy used in European buildings; a mandatory minimum increase in RES in industry of 1.1% per year; the transformation into a binding target of the existing goal of increasing the use of RES in heating and cooling by 1.1% per year; the introduction of new minimum targets for the\n\nuse of green hydrogen in industry and transpo/r\\_t.liga (50% and 2.6% per year respectively).\n\nFinally, another notewo/r\\_t.ligahy aspect of the European Commission proposal would be the creation of a new credit mechanism aimed at promoting the use of renewable electricity in transpo/r\\_t.liga and a commitment to remove barriers in the authorization process for new RES plants.\n\n## EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)\n\nThe European Commission is also proposing a reform of the EU ETS in order to strengthen it and increase its ambition in line with the EU climate commitments set out in the FF55 package. The proposed revision con/fi.ligarms the central role of the EU ETS as one of the main climate policy tools of the European Union, increasing the resilience of the market to economic shocks. A greater contribution to decarbonization is also requested from the sectors already covered by the EU ETS, while a proposal to extend the mechanism to new sectors (e.g., maritime, hydrogen production via electrolyzers) has also been put out for consultation, as has the possibility of creating a separate ETS market for the road transpo/r\\_t.liga and buildings sectors.\n\nAlthough the EU ETS reform is still in consultation, its publication alone has had an impact on supply and demand in the ETS market, having changed the expectations of operators and therefore prices on the market itself.",

        "page_content": "## Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)\n\nOne of the most innovative elements the FF55 package, one that is likely to spark debate, is the CBAM, a tari/ff.liga to be applied to impo/r\\_t.ligaed goods produced in countries with lower environmental standards than those in the EU. The objective of the CBAM mechanism is to reduce the risk of carbon leakage. This is to ensure that impo/r\\_t.ligaed products are treated no less favorably than domestic products manufactured in facilities subject to the EU ETS mechanism. As installations covered by the EU ETS are subject to a carbon price assessed on the basis of their actual emissions, impo/r\\_t.ligaed products included in the CBAM scope should also be assessed on the basis of their actual greenhouse gas emissions. However, in order to enable companies to adapt to this system, the proposal envisages a transitional period without /fi.liganancial adjustment. This mechanism will be phased in and would initially apply only to a select number of goods at high risk of carbon leakage: iron and steel, cement, fe/r\\_t.ligailizers, aluminum and electricity generation.\n\n## Energy e/ffi.ligaciency and buildings\n\nThe proposed revision of the Energy E/ffi.ligaciency Directive aims to establish more ambitious binding European targets for 2030 (+36% compared with the previous +32.5%), in line with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases by 55% by 2030. The directive introduces a system for calculating the indicative contributions that each Member State must establish in order to achieve the EU target and, among the measures, proposes a doubling of the annual energy saving obligation for end uses. The public sector is called upon to make an even larger energy saving contribution, equal to 1.7% per year, in addition to the 3% renovation obligation for the public building stock. The directive imposes measures on the Member States designed to alleviate energy pove/r\\_t.ligay, increasing energy e/ffi.ligaciency measures for vulnerable customers through ad hoc /fi.liganancing.\n\nIn December 2021, the European Commission published the proposed revision of the directive on the energy performance of buildings, aimed at reducing their energy consumption in order to achieve zero emissions by 2050 for buildings as well. The measures seek in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular to increase the rate of renovation for buildings with the worst energy pe/r\\_f.ligaormance by introducing minimum pe/r\\_f.ligaormance standards  and  strengthening  energy  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates. The targets also envisage the achievement of progressively higher standards sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2030 for the entire residential sector. In order to beef up measures for electric mobility as well, the changes envisage measures to increase charging points and pre-cabling in the residential sector.\n\n## Energy Taxation Directive (ETD)\n\nThe European Commission  believes that Directive 2003/96/EC  is  now  obsolete  and  does  not  adequately re/fl.ligaect the revised EU climate and energy policy. The proposed  revision  of  Directive  2003/96/EC  addresses  two main areas of reform: the provision of a new structure for the tax rates and the broadening of the tax base with the abolition of some subsidies.\n\n- \u00b7 Under this new structure, conventional fossil fuels (e.g., diesel and gasoline) and unsustainable biofuels will be subject to the higher minimum rate of \u20ac10.75/GJ when used as motor fuel and \u20ac0.9/GJ when used for heating.\n- \u00b7 The proposal delineates a new structure of minimum tax rates based on the actual energy content and environmental pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of fuels and electricity, rather than volume as is currently the case. The minimum rates will be expressed in \u20ac/GJ for each product, also in order to allow a direct comparison between fuels and between emerging uses of electricity. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the proposal groups energy products and electricity into general categories, which are classi/fi.ligaed according to energy  content  and  environmental  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance:  the new system will therefore ensure that the most polluting fuels are taxed at the highest rate. Member States will have to ensure that this ranking is replicated at the national level.\n- \u00b7 To take account of their potential role in suppo/r\\_t.ligaing decarbonization in the medium term, despite being fossil based, fuels such as natural gas, LPG and non-renewable fuels of non-biological origin shall be subject to a minimum rate of \u20ac7.17/GJ when used as motor fuel and \u20ac0.6/GJ when used for heating for a transitional period of 10 years before being taxed at the same rate as conventional fossil fuels. In order to re/fl.ligaect the potential of sustainable but non-advanced biofuels in suppo/r\\_t.ligaing decarbonization, they would be subject to tax at half the reference rate, i.e., a minimum of \u20ac5.38/GJ when used as motor fuel and \u20ac0.45/GJ when used for heating.\n- \u00b7 The lowest minimum tax rate (\u20ac0.15/GJ) will apply to electricity (regardless of use), sustainable biofuels and biogas  and  renewable  fuels  of  non-biological  origin (such as, for example, renewable hydrogen). Low-carbon hydrogen and related fuels will also bene/fi.ligat from the same rate for a transitional period of 10 years. The rate applicable to this group is set signi/fi.ligacantly below the reference rate, as electricity and these fuels can signi/fi.ligacantly suppo/r\\_t.liga the EU's clean energy transition towards achieving the EU Green Deal targets and, ultimately, climate neutrality by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The proposal requires Member States to increase charging capacity in line with zero-emission passenger car registrations  and  to  install  public,  interoperable  and user-friendly charging points at regular intervals along major European motorway corridors. In addition, objectives are set for the development of the infrastructure necessary to supply electricity to ships and airplanes while they are in po/r\\_t.ligas and airpo/r\\_t.ligas respectively;\n- \u00b7 a proposal to revise the regulation on CO 2 emission performance levels for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, requiring passenger car emissions to decrease by 55% and van emissions to fall by 50% by 2030 compared with 2021 levels and by 100% by 2035;\n- \u00b7 in addition to these measures, the European Commission's proposal for two new legislative initiatives, 'ReFuelEU Aviation' and 'FuelEU Maritime', targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for aviation and maritime transpo/r\\_t.liga, se/t\\_t.ligaing increasingly stringent emission limits for ships and planes, and envisaging measures to promote renewable or low-carbon fuels.\n\nTo complement the measures contained in the 'Fit for 55' package, in December 2021 the European Commission completed the issue of a new package of transpo/r\\_t.liga initiatives. The main proposals contained in the December package concern:\n\n- \u00b7 the issue of the 'EU Urban Mobility Framework' communication  encouraging  the  transition  towards  zero-emission mobility at the local level (cities and regions), with the adoption of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and Sustainable Urban Logistics Plans (SULPs), as well as facilitating access to and sharing of mobility data to suppo/r\\_t.liga decision-making processes and establishing new funding programs for new projects (such as Horizon Europe 2021-2023).\n- \u00b7 a revision of the TEN-T regulation in which, among other aspects, the role of zero-emission transpo/r\\_t.liga and the related infrastructure is reinforced as one of the priorities for the completion of the European transpo/r\\_t.liga network and the structure of the TEN-T network is modi/fi.ligaed;\n\nAt the end of 2021, the proposals in the /fi.ligarst and second packages are being discussed both within the European Council and the European Parliament. Talks are expected to continue throughout much of 2022.\n\n## Decarbonization package for the hydrogen and gas market\n\nOn December 15, 2021, the European Commission published proposals to decarbonize the gas market through the uptake of renewable and low-carbon gases, including hydrogen.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the proposal sets out a new regulatory framework for the hydrogen sector, including infrastructure, and standards for the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation of low-carbon gases that ensure a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAmong the salient points of the package are rules on vertical and horizontal unbundling and on third-pa/r\\_t.ligay access in the hydrogen sector, with less stringent provisions until 2030 and exemptions for existing and new geographically con/fi.liganed hydrogen networks. The gas package provides for separate remuneration mechanisms for gas and hydrogen  infrastructures,  but  allows  /fi.liganancial  transfers  to develop the hydrogen network and tari/ff.liga discounts. Finally, under the provisions of the gas package, 5% blending of hydrogen and natural gas should be accepted by TSOs at the border.\n\n## Digital technology\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the publication of the communication 'European digital decade: digital targets for 2030', which illustrates the objectives and methods of Europe's digital transformation by 2030, the implementation activities for the European Green Deal and the strategies for data and a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence published by the European Commission in 2019 and 2020, respectively, guided the debate on the digitization and use of data. A number of legislative and non-legislative initiatives have been proposed with the aim of making Europe digitally sovereign and creating a fair and competitive digital economy. The proposed measures range from the concept of data sovereignty to the creation of a single market for data and initiatives involving a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence and cyber security. The main proposals regarded:\n\n- \u00b7 a proposed EU Data Act governing data access and interoperability aimed at establishing a platform for each country (interoperable with the others) in which consumers can easily share energy data with third pa/r\\_t.ligaies;\n- \u00b7 the a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence regulation, published in April 2021, as the world's /fi.ligarst a/t\\_t.ligaempt to govern a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence (AI). The European Commission proposes an ex-ante list of 'AI' products considered to be high risk, such as the safety components of critical infrastructures,  which  must  undergo  testing  before  obtaining ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation;",

Negotiations between institutions began in February 2021 and are still ongoing.\n\n## Ba/t\\_t.ligaeries\n\nIn December 2020, the European Commission presented a proposal to revise the regulation on ba/t\\_t.ligaeries and waste ba/t\\_t.ligaeries, which would replace the current direc-\n\n## State aid\n\n## Revision of State aid guidelines\n\nOn January 7, 2021, the response to the public consultation on the State aid guidelines for climate, environment and energy (CEEAG) was published.\n\nOn June 7, the European Commission published a draft revision of the CEEAG, which was issued for a /fi.liganal public consultation lasting until August 2. The CEEAG are of considerable impo/r\\_t.ligaance for the energy sector and for the Enel Group, as they will guide investment suppo/r\\_t.liga for decarbonization in the coming years. The draft text includes a new section dedicated to aid for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including aid for the production of renewable and low-carbon energy, aid for energy e/ffi.ligaciency, including high-e/ffi.ligaciency cogeneration, aid for hydrogen, aid for storage and ba/t\\_t.ligaeries and aid for the reduction or prevention of emissions from industrial processes. An entire chapter has been dedicated to sustainable mobility, which governs aid for electric mobility and charging infrastructure, including the maritime sector. Energy e/ffi.ligaciency measures for buildings are also regulated, including batteries and charging of electric vehicles. The proposed rules also o/ffi.ligacially recognize that /fi.liganancing for natural or legal monopoly power grids does not represent State aid. Finally, aid to nuclear technologies and fossil fuels are excluded from the scope of the guidelines. The document prepared and issued on August 2 incorporated the new proposals of the European Commission, underscoring the need to explicitly include all types of storage, including stand-alone systems, among the technologies allowed in the section dedicated  to  aid  for  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas\n\ntive. The proposal pursues three objectives: to enhance the operation of the internal market (including products, processes, waste ba/t\\_t.ligaeries and recycled materials) by ensuring a level playing /fi.ligaeld through a common set of rules; to promote the circular economy; and to reduce environmental and social impacts at all stages of the ba/t\\_t.ligaery life cycle. Key elements of the proposal include mandatory requirements for all ba/t\\_t.ligaeries placed on the EU market, requirements for end-of-life management of ba/t\\_t.ligaeries, as well as new collection targets for po/r\\_t.ligaable waste ba/t\\_t.ligaeries and requirements to facilitate the reuse of industrial vehicle and electric vehicle ba/t\\_t.ligaeries as stationary storage ba/t\\_t.ligaeries. Throughout 2021, both the European Council and the European Parliament continued the analysis of the proposal: once their positions have been /fi.liganalized, informal negotiations (trilogues) will begin on reaching an agreement.\n\nemissions. This suggestion was successfully incorporated in the /fi.liganal text of the guidelines published on December 21, 2021, which entered force on January 1, 2022.\n\nOn October 6, the European Commission published the draft revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) with impo/r\\_t.ligaant changes to the sections relating to climate, environmental protection and energy, including an update of the noti/fi.ligacation thresholds. The GBER de/fi.liganes speci/fi.ligac categories of State aid that, under ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions, are compatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and exempts these categories from the obligation of prior noti/fi.ligacation to the Commission and its approval. The draft regulation proposes to expand the scope for Member States to /fi.liganance di/ff.ligaerent types of green projects, such as those to reduce CO 2 emissions, sustainable  mobility  and  charging  infrastructure.  It  also introduces new green conditions that large energy-intensive businesses must meet to receive aid in the form of reduced tax rates, as well as provisions on storage, hydrogen and building renovation projects that improve their energy pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and renewable energy communities. At the same time, the European Commission launched a public consultation ending on December 8, the date by which the contribution of the Enel Group was submi/t\\_t.ligaed. The document prepared commented positively on the revision of the GBER but called for a more ambitious commitment to storage, proposing to include all types and suggesting that Member States be given /fl.ligaexibility for measures to suppo/r\\_t.liga the electri/fi.ligacation of the system.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Italy's \u20ac191.5 billion recovery and resilience plan (of which \u20ac68.9 billion in grants and \u20ac122.6 billion in loans) will allocate 37% of total spending to suppo/r\\_t.liga measures for climate objectives, including large-scale restructuring investments aimed at\n\nimproving the energy e/ffi.ligaciency of buildings, interventions to promote the use of renewable energy sources, including hydrogen, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transpo/r\\_t.liga, with investments in sustainable urban mobility. Plans were also approved for Spain (\u20ac69.5 billion), Greece (\u20ac30.5 billion) and Romania (\u20ac14.2 billion). On  July  9,  the  European  Commission  approved  Italian plans to pa/r\\_t.ligaially compensate energy-intensive businesses  for  higher  electricity  prices  resulting  from  indirect costs of emissions allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The scheme will cover the indirect costs  of  emissions  incurred  in  the  2020-2030  period, with a provisional budget of about \u20ac1.49 billion.\n\nOn November 27, the European Commission approved a \u20ac2.27 billion Greek aid scheme to suppo/r\\_t.liga renewable electricity generation and high-e/ffi.ligaciency cogeneration. On  December  9,  the  European  Commission  approved a \u20ac3 billion scheme under the Spanish RRF to suppo/r\\_t.liga research,  development,  innovation,  environmental  protection and energy e/ffi.ligaciency in the automotive industry value chain.\n\nOn December 21, the European Commission approved a \u20ac1.4 billion scheme for the development of renewable energy in the non-interconnected islands of Greece, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular for hybrid power plants that generate and store both solar and wind power.",

The Sulcis, Po/r\\_t.ligaoferraio and Assemini plants were declared eligible for the cost reimbursement scheme for 2022.\n\nThe Po/r\\_t.ligao Empedocle plant is eligible for long-term cost reimbursement until 2025, while plants located on the smaller islands are automatically eligible for cost reimbursement for all years in which they are declared essential, including 2021 and 2022. Admission to the cost reimbursement scheme guarantees coverage of the operating costs of the aforementioned plants, including a return on capital invested. Generation cost reimbursement, net of plant revenue, is granted by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) with measures authorizing payments on account and a /fi.liganal balance payment based on applications submi/t\\_t.ligaed by operators.\n\nFor 2021 and 2022, the remainder of essential capacity was contracted under alternative contracts which provide for the obligation, on the Ancillary Services Market (ASM), to o/ff.ligaer to go up/down to prices no higher/lower than the values identi/fi.ligaed using methods established by ARERA for a /fi.ligaxed premium.\n\nWith Resolution no. 43/2021/R/eel ARERA rejected the requests submi/t\\_t.ligaed by Enel Produzione for the recalculation of the notional revenue for the costs of compliance with the ETS for the Brindisi Sud plant for years from 2017 to 2020, with a consequent reduction in the reimbursements due to the plant for those years. With the subsequent Resolution no. 67/2021/R/eel ARERA redetermined the payment on account for the Brindisi reimbursement valid for 2019 in order to align the calculation criteria of the notional revenue with Resolution no. 43/2021/R/eel. In April 2021, Enel Produzione /fi.ligaled an appeal against Resolution no. 43/2021/R/eel before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, for which the ruling is currently pending. In December 2021, a supplementary appeal was /fi.ligaled against Resolution no. 476/2021/R/eel, which applied the same criteria as those adopted in Resolution no. 43/2021/R/eel to determine the payment on account for the Brindisi Sud plant reimbursement for 2020.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, the Minister for Economic Development issued a decree approving the de/fi.liganitive rules gov-\n\nerning the capacity remuneration mechanism (the capacity market). On November 6 and November 28, 2019 two auctions were held with delivery in 2022 and 2023 respectively: Enel was awarded capacity for both years. A number of operators and a sectoral trade association contested the decree and the results of the two auctions before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga. Two operators  also  challenged  the  European  Commission decision approving the Italian mechanism before the EU Cou/r\\_t.liga, for which the ruling is currently pending. In April 2021, the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga suspended its ruling pending a ruling of the EU cou/r\\_t.liga, having found grounds to request a preliminary /fi.liganding concerning those proceedings.\n\nARERA has con/fi.ligarmed the transitional capacity payment mechanism for 2020 and 2021 in order to ensure continuity with the new capacity market, which will produce a /fi.liganancial impact sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2022.\n\nWith the Decree of the Minister for the Ecological Transition of October 28, 2021, the new capacity market regulation was approved.

The legislation requires a reduction in the remuneration received for electricity generated by non-emi/t\\_t.ligaing plants that are in peninsular areas and do not receive regulated remuneration. This reduction is a function of the monthly\n\ngas price and will be in e/ff.ligaect until March 31, 2022. RDL  23/2021  of  October  26,  2021,  containing  urgent\n\nmeasures in the /fi.ligaeld of energy for the protection of consumers and the introduction of transparency in the wholesale and retail markets for electricity and natural gas,  clari/fi.ligaed  that  the  power  generated  by  the  plants concerned already sold using forward hedging instruments with a /fi.ligaxed price will be excluded.\n\n## Renewable energy auctions\n\nJanuary 20, 2021 saw the /fi.ligarst renewable energy auction held as pa/r\\_t.liga of the new remuneration scheme envisaged under Royal Decree 960/2020, based on the provisions of  Order  TED/1161/2020.  A  total  of  2,993  MW  were\n\nawarded, of which 1,995 MW of photovoltaic power and 998 MW of wind power at an average price of \u20ac24.73/ MWh.\n\nThe  second  renewable  energy  auction  took  place  on October 19, 2021, held under the economic regime for renewable energy. A total of 3,124 MW were awarded, of which 2,258 MW of wind power and 866 MW of photovoltaic power at an average price of \u20ac30.59/MWh.\n\nOn December 30, 2021, the procedure for adjudicating the third auction, scheduled for April 6, 2022, began for 500 MW of solar thermoelectric, biomass, photovoltaic and other technologies, and a fu/r\\_t.ligaher 140 MW for smallscale photovoltaic projects with local pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation.\n\n## Proposal for a ministerial decree on the price of natural gas in the Canary Islands and Melilla\n\nIn November 2021, work began on a proposal for an order approving the price of natural gas for the generation of electricity in the Canary Islands and Melilla. It establishes the reference unit values of the remuneration scheme and addresses a number of technical issues. The order will allow the use of natural gas in the Non-Peninsular Territories of the Canary Islands and Melilla and sets the price to be paid for the generation units of these territories for the use of this fuel.\n\n## Order to revise fuel prices in Non-Peninsular Territories (NPT)\n\nOrder TEC/1260/2019 of December 26, 2019 revised the technical  and  /fi.liganancial  parameters  for  the  remuneration of generation units in the electrical systems of the Non-Peninsular Territories (NPT) for the second regulatory period (2020-2025). With regard to fuel prices, the order established that within three months the prices of energy products and logistics would be revised with a ministerial order with e/ff.ligaect from January 1, 2020. On August 7, 2020, Order TED/776/2020 of August 4 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, revising these prices.

It adopted urgent measures in tax ma/t\\_t.ligaers in order to reduce the impact of the increase in the price of electricity on customers. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the legislation contains the following measures:\n\n- \u00b7 a temporary suspension of the tax on the value of electricity generation during the 3rd Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2021, which  was  extended  until  December  31,  2021  with Royal Decree 17/2021 of September 14 and then until March 31, 2022 with Royal Decree Law 29/2021.\n- \u00b7 a reduction of value added tax from 21% to 10%, e/ff.ligaective until 31 December 2021, for the supply of electricity with contracted power equal to or less than 10 kW, provided that the arithmetic average price of the daily market of the last calendar month preceding the last day of the billing period exceeds \u20ac45/MWh, and in any case for the bene/fi.ligaciaries of the Social Bonus who are seriously vulnerable or at risk of social exclusion. This VAT reduction was subsequently extended until April 30, 2022 with Royal Decree Law 29/2021 of December 21, which adopts urgent measures in the energy /fi.ligaeld for the promotion of electric mobility, self-consumption and the expansion of renewable energy;\n\nThe royal decree law also establishes that if a surplus of income is generated by the electricity sector in 2020, it will be used in its entirety to cover the temporary imbalances in the 2021 tax year.\n\n## Royal Decree Law 29/2021 of December 21 adopting urgent measures in the energy /fi.ligaeld for the promotion of electric mobility, self-consumption and the expansion of renewable energy\n\nOn December 22, 2021, Royal Decree Law 29/2021 was published  in  Spain's  O/ffi.ligacial  Journal.  It  adopts  urgent measures in the energy /fi.ligaeld for the promotion of electric mobility, self-consumption and the expansion of renewable energy. Among other provisions, the legislation envisages the following measures:\n\n- \u00b7 with regard to taxation, the reduction of the special excise duty on electricity and value added tax is extended until April 30, 2022, as noted above, and the suspension of the tax on the value of electricity generation is extended until March 31, 2022;\n\n- \u00b7 a number of changes are introduced in the rules governing access and connection permits, extending the deadlines provided for in Royal Decree Law 23/2021 in order to facilitate the development of projects and allowing the voluntary restitution of access and connection permits obtained or in force before the entry into force of this royal decree law, with the return of guarantees.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Russia\n\n## Electricity and capacity markets\n\nGovernment Decree 1977 of December 1, 2020 provided for an indexation rate of 11.4% for regulated capacity rates for generators that begin selling capacity through long-term capacity auctions (KOM) from January 1, 2021 after the termination of the long-term capacity supply contract period (DPM).\n\nThe Federal Antitrust Service de/fi.liganed the regulated rates for 2021 (Order 1227/20 of December 17, 2020). More speci/fi.ligacally, the rates for the 1st Half of 2021 were not changed from their level in the 2nd Half of 2020. Conversely, the rates for Enel Russia plants in the 2nd Half of 2021 were modi/fi.ligaed as follows: KGRES: electricity +2.9%, capacity +4.4%; NGRES: electricity +2.5%, capacity +28%; SGRES: electricity +1.8%, capacity +3.4%\n\nThe Federal Antitrust Service has set regulated rates for 2022, with an increase of 3% compared with the 2nd Half of 2021.\n\n## Latin America\n\n## Chile\n\n## Rate revision - Introduction of the temporary electricity price stabilization mechanism\n\nOn November 2, 2019, Law 21.185 of the Ministry of Energy was published, introducing a temporary electricity price stabilization mechanism for customers subject to rate regulation. Consequently, the prices to be applied to regulated customers in the 2nd Half of 2019 were lowered to those applied in the 1st Half of 2019 (Decree 20T/2018) and were de/fi.liganed as 'stabilized prices for regulated customers' (PEC).\n\nBetween January 1, 2021 and the expiry of this mechanism, the prices to be applied will be those set every six months on the basis of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 158 of the Electricity Law and may not exceed the level of the PECs noted above adjusted for consumer price in/fl.ligaation.\n\nAny di/ff.ligaerences between the amount invoiced by applying the stabilization mechanism and the theoretical\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any imbalances in favor of the generation companies must be recovered no later than December 31, 2027.\n\n## Argentina\n\n## Rate revision - New resolutions\n\nThe generation companies sell the energy they produce and their capacity on the market at a price set by the market regulator, CAMMESA, which is also responsible for any subsequent rate adjustments or discounting.\n\nThe latest rate adjustment establishing new remuneration for generation companies was established with Res-\n\n## Enel Green Power\n\n## Italy\n\nThe Ministerial Decree of July 4, 2019 provided for competitive procedures based on Dutch auctions (selection of projects on the basis of price) and registers (selection of projects on the basis of an environmental criterion), depending on the installed capacity and by technology groups, including photovoltaic systems. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, up to October 2021, seven procedures will be held with:\n\n- \u00b7 registers for plants with a capacity of less than 1 MW. Unlike previous decrees, the Ministerial Decree of July 4, 2019 provides for a new method for suppo/r\\_t.ligaing renewable sources through two-way contracts for di/ff.ligaerences under which the successful tenderer returns any positive di/ff.ligaerences between the zonal price and the auction price.\n- \u00b7 Dutch auctions for plants with a capacity of more than 1 MW;\n\nAt September 30, 2021 the indicative annual cumulative cost was around \u20ac2.7 billion, compared with a ceiling of \u20ac5.8 billion for termination of the incentive mechanism.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, Legislative Decree 199 of November  8,  2021  transposing  Directive  (EU)  2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (the RED II Decree) was published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale.\n\nThe decree provides that capacity not assigned in the auction procedures referred to in the Ministerial Decree of July 4, 2019 shall be put up for auction in subsequent\n\nolution no. 440 published on May 21, 2021, which resulted in an increase of 29%.

The legislation provides for the possibility of launching calls for tenders to grant grid access capacity at both the Just Transition nodes and the rest of the network nodes, with variations depending on circumstances.\n\nOn January 26, 2021, auctions for 3,000 MW of renewables generation capacity took place, governed by the Resolution of December 10, 2020, of the State Secretariat for Energy. Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a was awarded 50 MW of photovoltaic solar capacity. In total, 2,036 MW of photovoltaic capacity and 998 MW of wind capacity were auctioned.\n\nIn June 2021, work began on a bill reducing the remuneration of non-GHG emi/t\\_t.ligaing generation plants placed in service before the entry into force of the Law 1/2005 (ETS) in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the increased revenue obtained from  the  incorporation  into  the  wholesale  electricity market price of the value of emission allowances for marginal technologies.\n\nIn November 2021, a ministerial order was published to govern the basis for the Access Capacity Contest in the Fair Transition Hub of Teruel organized in response to the closure of a large coal-/fi.ligared power plant owned by Endesa.\n\nIn the auction, for which proposal must be submi/t\\_t.ligaed in January 2022, 1,200 MW of grid access capacity will be awarded to the best proposals for renewables generation and storage projects with a high degree of technical maturity and environmental and socio-economic impact.\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the Council of Ministers approved a royal decree law containing reform measures for the electricity system to reduce the increase in electricity bills for consumers. The main feature of the legislation is a temporary reduction in revenue from generation in consideration of the increase in the cost of gas from en-\n\ntry into force of the measure until March 31, 2022. In October 2021, Royal Decree 23/2021 clari/fi.ligaed various aspects of this reduction, including the exclusion from the reduction mechanism of power produced by generation plants covered by hedging instruments that meet ce/r\\_t.ligaain characteristics.  Each  month,  producers  must make a responsible statement ce/r\\_t.ligaifying the existence of\n\nthese contracts. Most of the power generated by Endesa is sold under forward contracts.\n\nOn October 19, 2021, a second auction was held under the  new  remuneration  scheme  for  renewables  established with Order TED/1161/2020. The auction concluded with a weighted average price of \u20ac31.65/MWh for photovoltaic power and \u20ac30.18/MWh for wind power.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Greece\n\nFollowing  approval  by  the  European  Commission,  the Minister of Energy extended the remuneration mechanism  for  interruptibility  services  until  September  30, 2021.  Interruptibility  is  a  demand  response  service  in which  willing  industrial  consumers  will  interrupt  their consumption when required in exchange for a fee /fi.ligaxed by auction. The scheme is /fi.ligananced by all generators operating on the mainland, including EGPH, through the transfer of a percentage of their revenue. The percentage applied di/ff.ligaers depending on the generation technology used: wind = 1.8% (previously 2%), small hydro = 0.8% (previously 1%), PV = 3.6% (no change).\n\nThe decision of the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) no. 988/2021 published in December 2020 set the UOCC contribution  for  2022  at  \u20ac0.581/MWh  (in  2021  it  was \u20ac0.325/MWh). This rate applies to monthly revenue from electricity generation for all renewable and cogeneration units in operation and serves to cover the operating and investment costs of DAPEEP, the Greek operator responsible for managing renewable generation incentives and the issue of guarantees of origin.\n\n## Romania\n\nLaw 259/2021 approved a series of measures to protect consumers and businesses, with the introduction of a claw-back mechanism on the revenue of renewable and low carbon energy generators in consideration of the high price of power. For the period November 2021 - March 2022, sales from renewable electricity, hydroelectric and nuclear power at prices above \u20ac90/MWh will be taxed in arrears at 80%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It seeks to modernize  current  legislation  and  establishes  speci/fi.ligac provisions for the energy transition in order to boost the promotion,  development  and  use  of  non-conventional sources of energy, pa/r\\_t.ligaly with a view to accelerating the country's economic recovery process and strengthening companies supplying electricity and gas. The law establishes tax bene/fi.ligats for investments in non-conventional sources of energy, e/ffi.ligacient energy management, the development of hydrogen, the development of infrastructure projects to improve the electricity supply service, electric mobility and the sma/r\\_t.liga measurement of consumption.\n\n## No/r\\_t.ligah America\n\n## United States\n\n## Renewables incentives\n\nIn June 2021, the United States Depa/r\\_t.ligament of the Treasury amended the administrative guidelines for section 45 of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for investments in wind plants and for section 48 of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for investments in solar plants, giving projects additional time to be put into service on the condition that they meet the 'continuity requirements' within the 'continuity safe harbor' mechanism. The guidelines also clari/fi.ligaed how to meet the continuity requirements. Speci/fi.ligacally, the guidelines:\n\n- \u00b7 extend the period for entering service to /fi.ligave years for plants that sta/r\\_t.ligaed construction in 2020; and\n- \u00b7 extend the period for entering service to six years for plants that sta/r\\_t.ligaed construction in 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019;\n- \u00b7 provide taxpayers who do not rely on the continuity safe harbor to demonstrate continuity using the 'continuous e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas' standard rather than the more restrictive 'continuous construction' standard, regardless of whether the project has begun construction.\n\n## Forced labor in the solar supply chain\n\nIn June 2021, US customs authorities responded to repo/r\\_t.ligas  by  issuing  a  'withhold  release  order'  (WRO)  on silicon-based products manufactured by the company Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd (Hoshine) and its subsidiaries, since they have been accused of exploiting their\n\nworkforce. The WRO restricts the impo/r\\_t.liga into the United States of polysilicon products made by Hoshine.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaect on the US solar industry was the halt of shipments of photovoltaic modules by US customs, resulting in a delay in the delivery of solar equipment to end users, including Enel.\n\nAll photovoltaic equipment manufacturers had to produce clear documentation of their supply chain to meet US customs requirements. The documentation had to prove the speci/fi.ligac origin of metallurgical grade silicon in impo/r\\_t.ligaed photovoltaic products and demonstrate the absence of any Hoshine product in any pa/r\\_t.liga of the mining or manufacturing process.\n\nEnel's Code of Ethics and corporate procedures do not permit the exploitation of workers by any Group supplier or subcontractor. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, Enel is strengthening its controls, reviewing its supply chain and monitoring the implementation of the WRO by customs o/ffi.ligacials.\n\nIn a separate but connected development, in December 2021, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). UFLPA requires US customs authorities to apply a presumption that goods 'mined, produced, or manufactured in whole or in pa/r\\_t.liga' in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are made with forced labor and, therefore, are prohibited from being impo/r\\_t.ligaed into United States.\n\nGoods covered by this presumption shall not be allowed to enter unless the impo/r\\_t.ligaer proves that it has:\n\n- \u00b7 responded fully and substantially to all US customs inquiries; and\n- \u00b7 fully complied with government guidelines and regulations;\n- \u00b7 determined 'with clear and convincing evidence' that the goods were not produced using forced labor.\n\nPolysilicon is one of the three industries on which application of the WRO is focused, and this focus extends to photovoltaic equipment that could contain raw materials mined in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.\n\nImplementation of the law will be guided by an administrative  regulation  process  under  way  since  February 2022, which is expected to be completed by June 2022.\n\nAs stated in Enel's Human Rights Policy, the Group condemns any violation of human rights and imposes the same standard on its pa/r\\_t.liganers and suppliers. The Code of Ethics and Enel's corporate procedures therefore do not permit the exploitation of workers by any supplier or subcontractor of the Group.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, all companies that intend to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in an Enel Group tender and, therefore, who wish to be-",

This requirement is included in the contracts that suppliers sign.\n\nIn addition, Enel's supplier quali/fi.ligacation system ensures the careful selection and evaluation of companies wishing to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in procurement procedures. The system evaluates compliance with technical, /fi.liganancial, legal, environmental, health and safety, human rights and ethical integrity requirements in order to guarantee the quality and reliability of the contracts awarded.\n\nIn addition to the regular supplier quali/fi.ligacation process, Enel conducts factory assessments, focused on evaluating and monitoring the quality, production, risk management and logistics of each plant. Since 2021, Enel has implemented a chapter on supply chain sustainability, which addresses the key aspects of forced labor and ethical practices.\n\nThe 'In Broad Daylight: Uyghur Forced Labor and Global  Solar  Supply  Chains'  repo/r\\_t.liga  includes  four  suppliers with whom Enel has contractual relationships in the list of companies allegedly exposed to forced labor through their supply chains. Accordingly, the Group intensi/fi.ligaed its human rights controls:\n\n- \u00b7 requesting in-person visits to the sites of suppliers and sub-suppliers in order to verify compliance with the terms and conditions contained in their contracts with Enel;\n- \u00b7 requiring suppliers to provide detailed traceability information on their supply chain;\n- \u00b7 sharing best practices in relation to the content of the ethical codes (or similar documents) of Enel's suppliers.\n\nAs of February 2022, no evidence has been found that Enel's suppliers and subcontractors produce goods and materials in conditions that do not respect human rights.\n\nEnel has also adopted an ecosystem approach, working together with other utilities, suppliers and sector associations, to promote international industry statements aimed at guaranteeing full respect for human rights. In this context and in a global e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to ensure that the solar industry supply chain is free from forced labor, Enel Green Power No/r\\_t.ligah America, based in the United States, has signed the Solar Industry Forced Labor Prevention Pledge and has unde/r\\_t.ligaaken to suppo/r\\_t.liga the development of a supply chain traceability protocol by the Solar Energy Industries Association. In Europe, Enel Green Power has also signed SolarPower Europe's public declaration on forced labor in the Xinjiang region of China.\n\n## Bipa/r\\_t.ligaisan Infrastructure Law\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden signed a $1 trillion Bipa/r\\_t.ligaisan Infrastructure Law, unlocking funds for new spending on roads, bridges, aqueducts, broadband and other projects in /fi.ligascal years 2022-2026.\n\nThe new law also contains provisions to incentivize the expansion of the country's electricity grid and suppo/r\\_t.liga existing and new clean energy technologies. It also contains provisions to suppo/r\\_t.liga existing nuclear power plants and  hydroelectric  plants,  clean  up  abandoned  mining lands and facilitate access to critical minerals needed for clean energy production. Of potential interest to Enel, the bipa/r\\_t.ligaisan infrastructure law includes the following provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 electric buses: the DOT, through the Federal Transit Administration, will spend $5.3 billion over /fi.ligave years in grants to transpo/r\\_t.ligaation agencies for the Low or No Emission Vehicle Program. The program suppo/r\\_t.ligas transpo/r\\_t.liga agencies in purchasing or leasing low- or zero-emission buses and other vehicles using technologies such as ba/t\\_t.ligaeries;\n- \u00b7 EV charger infrastructure: the United States Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Energy (DOE) and the United States Depa/r\\_t.ligament  of  Transpo/r\\_t.ligaation  (DOT),  through  the  Federal Highway Administration, will spend $5 billion on the National EV Formula Program to create a national network of EV chargers along interstate highways. The funds will be split over /fi.ligave years between the states. The plan is geared towards fostering con/fi.ligadence in electric vehicles by ensuring that drivers always have a place to recharge. The two depa/r\\_t.ligaments will also work with states to spend $2.5 billion over /fi.ligave years on alternative fuel infrastructure subsidies;\n- \u00b7 electric school buses: the US Environmental Protection Agency, through the Clean School Bus Program, will spend $5 billion over /fi.ligave years in the form of grants and discounts to states or local government agencies, as  well  as  contractors.  Eligible  contractors  include for-pro/fi.ligat or non-pro/fi.ligat entities that have the ability to sell clean school buses, zero-emission buses, charging or refueling facilities, or other equipment needed to charge, power or maintain clean/zero-emission school buses, or arrange funding for that sale;\n- \u00b7 demand response: the law sets a new standard for considering investment in demand response to expand the reach of the federal energy management program to include demand response in state energy conservation plans;\n- \u00b7 second life of EV ba/t\\_t.ligaeries for grid services: the DOE intends  to  award  grants  for  research,  development and demonstration projects seeking to give a second life to EV ba/t\\_t.ligaeries that have been used to power electric vehicles, as well as for technologies and processes for the /fi.liganal recycling and disposal of EV ba/t\\_t.ligaeries;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  legislation  ordered  the  Public  Utility Commission (PUC) to develop and implement rules in the natural gas and electricity sectors to meet the energy needs of the electricity system during extreme weather events and periods of low renewable energy production. Legislation was approved to securitize most of the liabilities deriving from the February storm, reducing the total amount for which market operators would be liable for (thus reducing Enel's liability).\n\nLegislation was also passed to restrict companies from entering into agreements with foreign-owned companies from China, Iran, No/r\\_t.ligah Korea and Russia if those agreements provide the la/t\\_t.ligaer with direct or remote access to the Texas power grid.\n\nIn August 2021, the state of Illinois enacted a law to raise the state's Renewable Po/r\\_t.ligafolio Standard (RPS) targets, provide incentives for electric vehicles and e-buses, and create new energy storage and network modernization programs.\n\nIllinois will switch to 100% clean energy by 2050, with interim targets of 50% by 2040 and 40% by 2030. The legislation translates into the closure of private coal plants of over 25 MW by 2030. Publicly owned coal/natural gas plants will close by 2045. By 2030, Illinois will have 1 million electric vehicles on the road, with $10 million available annually to conve/r\\_t.liga state and local /fl.ligaeets.\n\nThere are also policies to create goals for ba/t\\_t.ligaery storage systems (BESS).\n\nProject work contracts will be required for all new industrial-scale solar and wind projects, and the renewable energy industry is required to repo/r\\_t.liga on diversity and inclusion goals as of April 2022.\n\nIn July 2021, the Missouri legislature approved a change in the tax assessment of wind farms that increased the tax exposure for assets that have been operating in the state for more than 5 years from 35% of the estimated value to 37.5%.\n\nNew Jersey has implemented an industrial-scale solar renewable energy incentive program that is administered by the state's Bureau of Public Utilities. Additionally, in July 2021, the New Jersey legislature passed a law that will allow solar development on agricultural land, enabling the state to meet its solar development goals.\n\nConnecticut passed a law in June 2021 that sets a ba/t\\_t.ligaery power storage target of 1 GW by 2030.\n\nColorado and Nevada both passed laws in June 2021 that require utilities in each state to join a regional transmission organization by 2030.\n\n## Canada\n\nCanada announced a reinforced climate plan called 'A Healthy  Environment  and  a  Healthy  Economy'  at  the United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  (COP26) in November 2021 in order to achieve the Paris Agreement's strengthened goal of reducing emissions by 4045% from 2005 levels by 2030. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which became law on June 29, 2021, enshrines Canada's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The law ensures transparency  and  accountability  as  the  government  works  to achieve its goals.\n\nThe Minister of Environment and Climate Change will establish the country's emissions reduction plan for 2030 by the end of March 2022.\n\nThe law requires public pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation and independent advice to guide the Canadian government's e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas. As pa/r\\_t.liga of the plan, the government launched the $8 billion Net-Zero Accelerator Fund to help large polluters reduce their emissions.\n\nIn  August  2021,  the  government  launched  a  /fi.ligave-year $2.19 billion fund to help transpo/r\\_t.ligaation service providers move away from fossil fuel engines and switch to zero-emission vehicles. The Zero Emission Transit Fund is pa/r\\_t.liga of the federal government's $11.9 billion investment in public transpo/r\\_t.ligaation and adds to Canada Infrastructure Bank's planned $1.19 billion investment in zero-emission buses through its three-year growth plan. This fund seeks to suppo/r\\_t.liga public transpo/r\\_t.liga and school bus operators to plan the switchover to electric vehicles, suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the purchase of 5,000 zero-emission buses and building suppo/r\\_t.liga infrastructure, including charging stations.

        "page_content": "During the federal election in September 2021, the Liberal Pa/r\\_t.ligay (currently in o/ffi.ligace) pledged to double Canada's existing clean energy capacity to reach its net-zero emissions target by 2050. The Canadian Infrastructure Bank is injecting $5 billion to advance clean energy generation, transmission and storage and have pledged to invest an additional $1 billion over the next four years to  suppo/r\\_t.liga  renewable  energy  and  grid  modernization projects.  While  the  federal  government  has  no  direct responsibility for Canada's power grids (they are under provincial jurisdiction), the government has commi/t\\_t.ligaed itself to:\n\n- \u00b7 develop additional investment tax credits for a range of renewable energy and ba/t\\_t.ligaery storage solutions to accelerate the deployment of clean energy into the grid;\n- \u00b7 introduce a Clean Electricity Standard to achieve a 100% net-zero emissions electricity system by 2035;\n- \u00b7 create  a  Pan-Canadian  Grid  Council  in  pa/r\\_t.liganership with  provinces,  territories,  indigenous  peoples,  the private sector, labor organizations and civil society:\n- -the Grid Council will promote the most cost-e/ff.ligaective  approaches  to  planning  and  developing  the electricity system in Canada, while promoting competitiveness to sell more clean Canadian power to the United States.\n- -the  Grid  Council  will  work  to  establish  national standards, best practices and incentives to promote investment in infrastructure, sma/r\\_t.liga grids, grid integration and innovation in the electricity sector, with the aim of making Canada the world's most reliable, a/ff.ligaordable and carbon-free electricity producer;\n\n## Africa, Asia and Oceania\n\n## South Africa\n\nThe state-owned utility Eskom has sta/r\\_t.ligaed transmission unbundling with the creation in December of the National Transmission Company South Africa (NTCSA), which is expected to be operational in 2022. Unbundling will facilitate competition in the power generation sector and improve access to the grid on a non-discriminatory basis.\n\n## India\n\nIn  2021,  the  government  granted  independent  power producers (IPPs) an extension of two and a half months to commission renewable energy plants due to the COVID emergency, provided that the IPPs did not request\n\nfu/r\\_t.ligaher extensions or increases in the rates under their power  purchase  agreements  (PPA).  The  Government subsequently eased this requirement by allowing IPPs to request fu/r\\_t.ligaher extensions based on the conditions set out in their PPAs. Enel Green Power India took advantage of the extension for the 285 MW Coral Project.\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  has  introduced  two  rules  that\n\nstrengthen the 'must-run' status for renewable projects, safeguarding IPPs against arbitrary cu/r\\_t.ligaailment and ensuring rapid recovery in the event of a change in law. To promote renewable energy projects, the government had  waived  transmission  rates  for  renewable  projects that sold electricity produced through long-term PPAs. The government then expanded the scope of this derogation by also allowing the cancellation of transmission rates for projects with sho/r\\_t.liga-term sales contracts and on power exchanges. The non-applicability of transmission rates represents an advantage for our projects.\n\n## South Korea\n\nThe main scheme to suppo/r\\_t.liga the development of renewables in Korea is the Renewable Po/r\\_t.ligafolio Standard (RPS), which obliges conventional generators with a capacity of more than 500 MW to procure a ce/r\\_t.ligaain amount of electricity from renewable sources annually. This share will gradually rise from 2% in 2012 to 25% by 2030. In 2021 the share was 9%.\n\nCompliance with the RPS (the percentage of electricity generated from renewables) can be achieved by building renewable plants or by purchasing green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (RECs). The number of RECs that a RES generator can sell for each MWh produced depends on the so-called 'multiplier' which di/ff.ligaers depending on the energy source. The multiplier values were updated in August 2021: the very  advantageous  multiplier  (x4)  for  BESS+RES  was abolished,  while  that  for  onshore  wind  was  increased from x1 to x1.2; solar PV is still less than 1 (x0.8).\n\nAnother impo/r\\_t.ligaant regulatory reform in 2021 was the introduction of a series of tools to facilitate the procurement of renewable energy by companies pa/r\\_t.ligaicipating in the RE100 initiative, with the (voluntary) objective of using 100% of green energy to drive their businesses. Among the most interesting tools for Enel Green Power is the REC trading platform, which allows the direct exchange of RECs between generators and companies. However, Third Pa/r\\_t.ligay PPAs and Direct PPAs can also represent new and potentially a/t\\_t.ligaractive routes to market by allowing the purchase and sale of renewable electricity between end users and generators without going through the energy market.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This period lasts eight years and is divided into two sub-periods of four years each (NPR1 for 2016-2019 and NPR2 for 20202023).\n\nWith regard to the NPR2 period, ARERA published Resolution no. 568/2019/R/eel, with which it updated rates for distribution and metering services in force in the 20202023  period,  publishing  the  new  integrated  texts  (TIT 2020-2023 and TIME 2020-2023).\n\nWith Resolution no. 639/2018/R/com, ARERA set the value of the WACC for distribution and metering activities, valid for the 2019-2021 period, at 5.9%.\n\nThe method for determining the WACC for the 2022-2027 period was updated with Resolution 614/2021/R/com, establishing a value of 5.2% for electricity distribution and metering. The regulation provides for an update of the value for 2025-2027, as well as the possibility of annual updating (in 2023 and 2024) should ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial indicators lead to a change in the WACC of at least 0.5%.\n\nAs for distribution and metering rates, ARERA approved both the de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2020, calculated by taking into account the actual balance sheet data for 2019 (Resolution no. 131/2021/R/eel), and the provisional reference rates for 2021 on the basis of the preliminary balance sheet data for 2020 (Resolution no. 159/2021/R/eel). The de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2021 are expected to be published in 2022.\n\nAs  regards  service  quality,  ARERA,  with  Resolution  no. 646/2015/R/eel  as  amended,  established  output-based regulation for electricity distribution and metering services, including the principles for regulation for 2016-2023 (TIQE  2016-2023).  With  Resolution  no.  566/2019/R/eel, ARERA completed the update of the TIQE for the 20202023 semi-period, proposing tools to bridge gaps in quality of service still existing between the various areas of the country, taking account of the time needed to implement interventions on the grid as well as the e/ff.ligaects of climate change.\n\nWith Resolutions nos. 212/2021/R/eel and 537/2021/R/eel, ARERA speci/fi.ligaed the bonuses for resilience interventions completed by e-distribuzione in 2019 and 2020 eligible for the bonus-penalty mechanism envisaged under the provisions of Resolution no. 668/2019/R/eel, which introduced an incentive mechanism for investments to increase the resilience of distribution grids in terms of resistance to loads deriving from extreme weather events.\n\nWith regard to relations between distributors and trad-\n\ners, on January 1, 2021 the new version of the Electricity Transpo/r\\_t.liga Grid Code came into force with Resolution no. 261/2020/R/eel, which due to the reduction in the time required to terminate transpo/r\\_t.liga contracts due to the default of sellers, reduced the credit exposure of distributors. Consequently, the value of guarantees that all sellers must give to distributors to cover the transpo/r\\_t.liga service provided was reduced (passing from a level of coverage ranging from 3 to 5 months of the trader's turnover to a new range between 2 and 4 months).\n\n## Energy e/ffi.ligaciency - White ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nThe decree of the Ministry for Ecological Transition of May 21, 2021 amended the ministerial decree of January 11, 2017 as already amended by the decree of the Ministry  for  Economic  Development  of  May  10,  2018. The  measure  set  the  national  quantitative  targets  for electricity and gas distribution companies for the years 2021-2024 and also reduced the objectives for 2020 by 60%. The decree also updated the methods for distribution companies to meet the obligation and for reimbursing the related costs.\n\n## Iberia\n\n## Methodology for calculating rates and electrical system charges\n\nOn  March  18,  2021,  Royal  Decree  148/2021  of  March 9, 2021 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, which establishes  the  methodology  for  calculating  electricity system charges. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, on March 28, Circular 3/2021 of March 17 of the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) was published, amending Circular 3/2020 of 15 January, which had established the methodology for calculating electricity transmission and distribution rates. The new rates for access to the transmission and distribution grid, as well as the new charges for the electricity system, entered into force on June 1, 2021, by way of the Resolution of March 18, 2021 of the CNMC, which established the access rates for the electricity transmission and distribution grids applicable from June 1, 2021, and Order TED/371/2021 of April 19, which established the rates for the electricity system and capacity payments applicable from June 1, 2021.\n\nOn September 15, 2021, Royal Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14 was published, containing urgent measures to mitigate the impact of the rise in natural gas prices in the gas and electricity retail markets. It reduced charges for the electricity system by about 96% from September 16, 2021 to December 31, 2021 compared with those in e/ff.ligaect from June 1, 2021.",

It entered into force on October 1, 2021. On September 29, 2021, Order TED/1023/2021 of September 27 was published, establishing charges for the gas system for the period between October 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022. The amount to be recovered for charges for this period is \u20ac26.9 million.\n\n## Electricity rates for 2021\n\nOn December 29, 2020, Order TEC/1271/2020 of December 22 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, establishing  various  costs  for  the  electricity  system  for 2021 and extending the electricity access rates until the rates tari/ff.ligas set by the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) come into force.\n\nSimilarly, on March 23, 2021, the Resolution of March 18, 2021 of the CNMC was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, approving the access rates for the transmission and distribution grids to be applied sta/r\\_t.ligaing from June 1, 2021.\n\nOn April 22, 2021, Order TED/371/2021 of April 19, 2021 was  published  in  Spain's  O/ffi.ligacial  Journal,  establishing electricity system charges applicable from June 1, 2021. Finally, Royal Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14 reduced electricity rates by about 96% in the period from its entry into force until December 31 2021.\n\n## Electricity rates for 2022\n\nOn December 22, 2021, the Resolution of December 16, 2021  of  the  National  Markets  and  Competition  Commission (CNMC) was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, establishing the access rates for the electricity transmission and distribution grids applicable from January 1, 2022, which represent an average reduction of 5.4% compared with their values at June 1, 2021.\n\nOn December 30, Order TED/1484/2021 of December 28 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, se/t\\_t.ligaing the electricity system rates to be applied from January 1, 2022 and establishing various regulated costs of the electricity system for 2022. The new charges for 2022 represent an average reduction of about 31% compared with the charges approved on June 1, 2021.\n\n## Natural gas rates for 2021\n\nCircular 6/2020 of July 22 of the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) approved the methodology for calculating rates for transpo/r\\_t.liga, local networks and natural gas regasi/fi.ligacation. In addition, it established that this Commission must set access rates for regasi/fi.ligacation plants and, if necessary, the billing deadlines for the period of operation of the transpo/r\\_t.liga and distribution\n\n## rates applicable from October 1, 2020.\n\nOn December 29, 2020, the Resolution of December 21 of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines was published, establishing the natural gas last reso/r\\_t.liga rate (TUR) to be applied from January 1, 2021, with an average increase of 4.6% and 6.3% for last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 1 (TUR 1) and last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 2 (TUR 2), respectively, due to the increase in the cost of the commodity. These values remained in force throughout the 1st Half of 2021 as the necessary condition for any change (a variance of +/-2% in the cost of the commodity) was not met.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the Resolution of June 24, 2021 of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines was published, establishing the natural gas last reso/r\\_t.liga rate (TUR) to be applied sta/r\\_t.ligaing from July 1, 2021, with a consequent increase of 2.9% and 3.9% for last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 1 (TUR 1) and last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 2 (TUR 2), respectively, due to the increase in the cost of the commodity.\n\nFinally, on September 29, 2021, the Resolution of September 26, 2021 of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines was published, which approves the natural gas last reso/r\\_t.liga rate (TUR) to be applied from October 1, 2021, which in compliance with Royal Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14 translated into an increase of 0.9%, 4.6% and 11.2% for last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 1 (TUR 1), last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 2 (TUR 2) and last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 3 (TUR 3), respectively.\n\n## Natural gas rates for 2022\n\nOn December 27, the Resolution of December 22, 2021 of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines was published, establishing the last reso/r\\_t.liga rate for natural gas to be applied in the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2022. Taking account of the provisions of Royal Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14, it translated into an increase of about 5.4%, 6.8% and 7.5% for last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 1 (TUR 1), last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 2 (TUR 2) and last reso/r\\_t.liga rate 3 (TUR 3), respectively.\n\n## Proposed remuneration for distribution activities from 2017 to 2019\n\nDuring November 2021, work began on preparing a proposed order approving the incentive or penalty for the reduction of losses in the electricity distribution grid for 2016, the modi/fi.ligacation of base remuneration for 2016 for several distribution companies and the modi/fi.ligacation of the remuneration for electricity distribution companies for 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\n## Direct subsidies to electricity distribution companies\n\nOn  December  22,  2021,  Royal  Decree  1125/2021  was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, promoting the digitization of distribution grids and charging infrastructure on public roads with suppo/r\\_t.liga from European funds under the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan.\n\nThe aid will amount to \u20ac525 million for 2021-2023, which\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is intended to divide the cost of policies to promote renewable energy, high-e/ffi.ligaciency cogeneration and energy recovery from waste among the various energy vectors.\n\nThe FNSSE, which will be implemented gradually over a 5-year period, will be /fi.ligananced with contributions from operators in the various energy sectors, taxes deriving from  Law  15/2012,  the  proceeds  of  auctions  of  CO 2 emission rights and, up to a limit of 10% of the annual value of the Fund, with funding from the general State budget or with EU funds.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Romania\n\nIn Romania, electricity distributors (DSOs) purchase electricity on wholesale markets to cover grid losses. The price recognized ex-ante by the regulator for such purchases in 2021 was largely exceeded by the closing prices on the wholesale electricity markets, with a serious impact on the cash /fl.ligaows of the DSOs. The rate mechanism provides for the recovery of grid losses: the di/ff.ligaerence with purchase costs for the year t is recouped through distribution rates for the year t+2, but the circumstances generated pressure on the 2021 balance sheets of the DSOs, with a negative impact on working capital.\n\n## Latin America\n\n## Chile\n\n## CNE Resolution no. 176/2020 - Exclusive activity\n\nOn June 9, 2020, CNE Resolution no. 176 was published. It establishes the substance of the obligation for exclusive operation and separate accounts in the provision of public electricity distribution services in conformity with Law 21.194.\n\nUnder the provisions of the resolution, companies holding  concessions  for  the  public  electricity  distribution service operating in the Chilean national electricity system will have to set up as companies exclusively engaged in distribution activities and will only be able to exercise economic activities involved in the provision of the public  distribution  service,  in  compliance  with  applicable legislation. The rules established in the resolution shall apply from January 1, 2021. Where a company is unable to comply by that date for legitimate reasons, subject to notifying the CNE the application of the resolution may be postponed, but in any case not later than January 1, 2022.\n\n## Law 21.249 - Exceptional measures suppo/r\\_t.ligaing end users of health, electricity and gas services\n\nOn August 8, Law 21.249 was approved, introducing exceptional measures suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the most vulnerable customers, measures that, in large pa/r\\_t.liga, Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Chile was already implementing voluntarily. The measures include a moratorium on the interruption of supply due to arrears and make it possible to pay electricity bill arrears in installments for customers de/fi.liganed as vulnerable. These measures were extended and strengthened with Law 21.340 until December 31, 2021 or the end of the state of emergency declared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 'Average bare price'\n\nOn March 20, 2021, the Ministry of Energy published the average 'bare price' to be applied sta/r\\_t.ligaing from July 1, 2020, while on May 20, 2021 the Ministry of Energy also published the average bare price to be applied sta/r\\_t.ligaing from January 1, 2021.

As regards the gas sector, the elimination of price protections is scheduled to occur on January 1, 2023 for domestic customers and condominiums.\n\nWith regard to the end of price safeguards for small /fi.ligarms in the electricity sector (January 1, 2021), the Ministry for Economic Development issued a decree implementing the Competition Act on December 31, 2020, delegating the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) to de/fi.ligane the measures governing the transition to the free market based on ce/r\\_t.ligaain criteria and guidelines. With Resolution no. 491/2020/R/eel, ARERA established a last reso/r\\_t.liga service ('gradual safeguards service') for small businesses without a supplier, to be assigned by auction on a territorial basis for a period of three years. A ceiling of 35% was set for the market share that can be assigned to each supplier.\n\nIn March 2021, Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale (together with Enel Italia) appealed the ministerial decree before the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, contesting the imposition of the antitrust cap at 35% and the lack of provisions (e.g., a social clause) for the reimbursement of the residual costs of Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale following the loss of customers. With regard to the la/t\\_t.ligaer point, in March 2021, Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale  and  Enel  Italia  also  challenged  Resolution  no. 491/2020/R/eel with an appeal before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga. At the moment, no hearing has yet been set for these appeals.\n\nWith  ruling  no.  18/2021,  the  Lombardy  Regional  Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga granted the appeals /fi.ligaled by Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale and Enel Energia, voiding Resolution no. 279/2017/R/com. The resolution had established an incentive mechanism to increase the use of electronic invoices with customers on the regulated markets and made the compensation for the seller of the di/ff.ligaerential between the discount granted to customers and the avoided cost conditional upon reaching ce/r\\_t.ligaain thresholds. With Resolution no. 477/2021/R/com, ARERA consequently also amended, with e/ff.ligaect from 2022, the rules governing the recovery of amounts relating to previous years.\n\n## Electricity\n\nWith Resolution no. 604/2020/R/eel, ARERA updated for 2021 the rate component covering the marketing costs of  the  operators  of  the  enhanced  protection  service (RCV) and the levels of the PCV fee, which represents the reference price for sellers on the free market.\n\nWith  Resolution  no.  402/2021/R/eel,  the  updating  of the RCV and the PCV for 2022 was postponed to the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2022, with e/ff.ligaect from April 1, 2022, taking account of the need to cover the costs incurred by operators from January 2022 in the upcoming determinations.\n\nWith ruling no. 565 of March 27, 2020, the Lombardy Regional  Administrative  Cou/r\\_t.liga  pa/r\\_t.ligaially  voided  Resolution no. 119/2019/R/eel, with which ARERA had introduced changes to the compensation mechanism for the amounts  not  collected  by  operators  of  the  enhanced protection service in respect of fraudulent withdrawals of power. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga voided the pa/r\\_t.liga of the resolution in which it provided for a reduction in the amounts subject to reimbursement for amounts invoiced in the period prior to its entry into force (April 2, 2019).

        "page_content": "## Outlook for operations\n\nThe progressive roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 created the conditions for strong growth at a global level. In this environment, the Group experienced a sound recovery in operating indicators in terms of generation, distribution and sales to end users of electricity. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Enel Group accelerated the construction of new renewables capacity during the year, with over 5 GW of new installed capacity worldwide, representing the absolute record for the Group, with an increase of more than 2 GW on the new capacity installed in 2020.\n\nAt the same time, macroeconomic conditions were sharply in/fl.ligauenced by strong growth in the prices of commodities, such as gas and coal, which have a direct impact on the price of electricity. This prompted the authorities of some European countries to intervene in an a/t\\_t.ligaempt to calm the increase in electricity prices for consumers, with measures that in some cases penalized companies operating in electricity generation and sales.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  geographical  diversi/fi.ligacation  of  the Group, its integrated business model along the entire value chain, a sound /fi.liganancial structure and a high degree of digitalization have enabled Enel to display considerable resilience, which is re/fl.ligaected in our pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and /fi.liganancial position.\n\nIn November 2021, the Group presented its new Strategic Plan, also providing a vision of the evolution of the business in this decade.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the Strategic Plan focuses on four strategic lines of action.\n\n## \u00b7 Allocate capital to suppo/r\\_t.liga the supply of decarbonized electricity.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2030, the Enel Group plans to mobilize investments totaling \u20ac210 billion, of which \u20ac170 billion invested directly by the Group (an increase of 6% compared with the previous Plan) and \u20ac40 billion catalyzed by third pa/r\\_t.ligaies.\n\nWith  these  investments,  the  Enel  Group  expects  to achieve total renewables capacity of about 154 GW by 2030, tripling the Group's renewables po/r\\_t.ligafolio compared with 2020, as well as increasing the grid's customer base by 12 million and promoting the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, increasing the volume of electricity sold by almost 30% while at the same time focusing on  the  development  of  beyond-commodity  services, such  as  public  electric  mobility  or  behind-the-meter storage, in collaboration with pa/r\\_t.liganers.\n\n## \u00b7 Enable the electri/fi.ligacation of customer energy demand.\n\nThe Group's strategic actions will seek to increase value for customers in the business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) segments, increasing the level of electri/fi.ligacation of these customers while simultaneously improving the services we deliver. In 'Tier 1' countries, it is expected that this targeted strategy, combined with investments in the basic asset, will increase the Group's integrated margin by to 2.6 times between 2021 and 2030, with the suppo/r\\_t.liga of a uni/fi.ligaed platform capable of managing the world's largest customer base among private operators.\n\n## \u00b7 Leverage the creation of value throughout the value chain.\n\nIn order to enhance the strategy of focusing on customers through the use of platforms, in 2021 the Group created  the  Global  Customer  Operations  Business Line, which is responsible for de/fi.liganing the commercial strategy and for directing the allocation of capital towards customer needs, leveraging electri/fi.ligacation while achieving excellent service levels.\n\nThe refocusing of the Group will go hand in hand with the  simpli/fi.ligacation  and  rebalancing  of  its  po/r\\_t.ligafolio, through:\n\n- -using resources made available from the disposal of assets that no longer suppo/r\\_t.liga the Group's strategy; and\n- -a focus on 'Tier 1' countries;\n- -mergers and acquisitions designed to improve positioning, acquire skills or generate synergies.\n\n## \u00b7 Achieve sustainable Net-Zero objectives in advance.\n\nThe  Group  has  moved  its  'Net-Zero'  commitment forward by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, for all emissions along the value chain. The Group plans to abandon thermal generation by 2040, replacing it with new renewables capacity and hybridize renewables with storage solutions. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, we expect that by 2040 the electricity sold by the Group will be generated entirely from renewables and, by the same year, the Group will exit the retail gas sales business.\n\nAs a result of the strategic lines of action described above, between 2020 and 2030 the Group's ordinary EBITDA is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 5-6%, with the ordinary pro/fi.ligat of the Group expected to increase at a compound annual rate of 6-7%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Form and content of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements\n\nEnel SpA has its registered o/ffi.ligace in Viale Regina Margherita 137, Rome, Italy, and since 1999 has been listed on the Milan stock exchange.\n\nThere were no changes in the company name in 2021.\n\nEnel is an energy multinational and is one of the world's leading integrated operators in the electricity and gas industries, with a special focus on Europe and Latin America. The consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as at and for the year  ended  December  31,  2021  comprise  the  /fi.liganancial statements of Enel SpA, its subsidiaries and Group holdings in associates and joint ventures, as well as the Group's share of the assets, liabilities, costs and revenue of joint operations ('the Group').\n\nA list of the subsidiaries, associates, joint operations and joint ventures included in the consolidation scope is attached.\n\nThese consolidated /fi.liganancial statements were approved and authorized for publication by the Board of Directors on March 17, 2022.\n\nThese consolidated /fi.liganancial statements have been audited by KPMG SpA.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards (International Accounting Standards - IAS and International Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Standards - IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Commi/t\\_t.ligaee (IFRSIC) and the Standing Interpretations Commi/t\\_t.ligaee (SIC), recognized in the European Union pursuant to Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 and in e/ff.ligaect as of the close of the year. All of these standards and interpretations are hereinafter referred to as the 'IFRS-EU'.\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements have also been prepared in conformity with measures issued in implementation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 9, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree 38 of February 28, 2005.\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements consist of the consolidated income statement, the statement of consolidated comprehensive income, the statement of consolidated /fi.liganancial position, the statement of consolidated changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows and the related notes.\n\nThe assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of consolidated /fi.liganancial position are classi/fi.ligaed on a 'current/ non-current basis', with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of assets held for sale and liabilities included in disposal groups held for sale. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, are assets that are intended to be realized, sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Group; current liabilities are liabilities that are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled during the normal operating cycle of the Group. The consolidated income statement classi/fi.ligaes costs on the basis of their nature, with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of pro/fi.ligat from continuing operations and pro/fi.ligat/(loss) from discontinued operations a/t\\_t.ligaributable to owners of the Parent and to non-controlling interests.\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows is prepared using the indirect method, with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of any cash /fl.ligaows by operating, investing and /fi.liganancing activities associated with discontinued operations.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, although the Group does not diverge from the provisions of IAS 7 in the classi/fi.ligacation of items:\n\n- \u00b7 investing activities comprise investments in prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment and intangible assets and disposals of such assets and contract assets related to service concession arrangements.

Accounting policies\n\n## 2.1 Use of estimates and management judgment\n\nPreparing the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements under IFRS-EU requires management to take decisions and make estimates and assumptions that may impact the carrying amounts of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities and the related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience and other factors considered reasonable in the circumstances. They are formulated when the carrying amount of assets and liabilities is not easily determined from other sources. The actual results may therefore di/ff.ligaer from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are periodically revised and the e/ff.ligaects of any changes are re/fl.ligaected through pro/fi.ligat or loss if they only involve that period. If the revision involves both the current and future periods, the change is recognized in the period in which the revision is made and in the related future periods.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, the following sections examine the main items a/ff.ligaected by the use of estimates and the cases that re/fl.ligaect management judgments to a signi/fi.ligacant degree, underscoring the main assumptions used by management in measuring these items in compliance with the IFRS-EU. The critical element of such valuations is the use of assumptions and professional judgments concerning issues that are by their very nature unce/r\\_t.ligaain.\n\nChanges in the conditions underlying the assumptions and judgments could have a substantial impact on future results. The  information  included  in  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements is selected on the basis of a materiality analysis\n\nto each individual item, and of non-current assets and disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, which are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe  consolidated  /fi.liganancial  statements  are  presented  in euro, the functional currency of the Parent Enel SpA. All /fi.ligagures are shown in millions of euro unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe  consolidated  income  statement,  the  statement  of consolidated  /fi.liganancial position  and  the  consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows repo/r\\_t.liga transactions with related pa/r\\_t.ligaies, the de/fi.liganition of which is given in note 2.2 'Signi/fi.ligacant accounting policies'.\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous year.\n\ncarried out in accordance with the requirements of Practice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgments', issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and on the basis of investor expectations. (22) In addition, as regards the impact of COVID-19, the continuing instability connected with the pandemic creates unce/r\\_t.ligaainty in forecasts for future developments in the macroeconomic, /fi.liganancial and business environment in which the Group operates, which is re/fl.ligaected in the assessments and the estimates produced by management regarding the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities a/ff.ligaected by greater volatility. Please see note 6 'COVID-19 disclosures' for details on the areas of the /fi.liganancial statements most a/ff.ligaected by the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing on the information available at December 31, 2021 and considering the constantly evolving scenario. With regard to the e/ff.ligaects of climate change issues, the Group believes that climate change represents an implicit  element  in  the  application  of  the  methodologies  and models used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm estimates in the valuation and/or measurement  of  ce/r\\_t.ligaain  accounting  items.  Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the Group has also taken account of the impact of climate change in the signi/fi.ligacant judgments made by management. In this regard, the main items included in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2021 a/ff.ligaected by management's use of estimates and judgments refer to the impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets, obligations connected with the energy transition, including those for decommissioning and site restoration of ce/r\\_t.ligaain generation plants, and the impairment of inventories of a number of coal-/fi.ligared plants. For fu/r\\_t.ligaher details on these items, see note 18 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment', note 23 'Goodwill', note 32 'Inventories' and note 39 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Use of estimates\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from supply of electricity and gas to end users is recognized at the time the electricity or gas is delivered and includes, in addition to amounts invoiced on the basis of periodic (and pe/r\\_t.ligaaining to the year) meter readings or on the volumes noti/fi.ligaed by distributors and transpo/r\\_t.ligaers, an estimate of the electricity and gas delivered during the period but not yet invoiced that is equal to the di/ff.ligaerence between the amount of electricity and gas delivered to the distribution network and that invoiced in the period, taking account of any network losses. Revenue between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end is based on estimates of the daily consumption of individual customers, primarily determined on their historical information, adjusted to re/fl.ligaect the climate factors or other ma/t\\_t.ligaers that may a/ff.ligaect the estimated consumption.\n\nFor more details on such revenue, see note 10.a 'Revenue from sales and services'.\n\n## Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets\n\nWhen the carrying amount of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, investment prope/r\\_t.ligay, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, goodwill and investments in associates/joint ventures exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use, the assets are impaired.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, as described in greater detail in note 23 'Goodwill'.\n\nIn order to determine the recoverable amount, the Group generally adopts the value in use criterion. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash /fl.ligaows generated by the asset, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/fl.ligaects the current market assessment of the time value of money and of the speci/fi.ligac risks of the asset.\n\nFuture cash /fl.ligaows used to determine value in use are based on the most recent Business Plan, approved by the management, containing forecasts for volumes, revenue, operating costs and investments. These projections cover the next three years. For subsequent years, account is taken of:\n\n- \u00b7 a long-term growth rate equal to the long-term growth of electricity demand and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business) that does not in any case exceed the average long-term growth rate of the market involved.\n- \u00b7 assumptions  concerning  the  long-term  evolution  of the main variables considered in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows, as well as the average residual useful life of the assets or the duration of the concessions, based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses;\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to the estimates and assumptions used in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows and the\n\ndiscount rates applied. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, possible changes in the underlying assumptions on which the calculation of such amounts is based could generate di/ff.ligaerent recoverable amounts. The analysis of each group of non-/fi.liganancial assets is unique and requires management to use estimates and assumptions considered prudent and reasonable in the speci/fi.ligac circumstances.\n\nIn the current scenario, the analysis of impairment indicators has become even more impo/r\\_t.ligaant as an a/t\\_t.ligaempt was also made to assess whether the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  could  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  ce/r\\_t.ligaain non-/fi.liganancial assets as at December 31, 2021. For this reason, the Group has carefully considered the e/ff.ligaects of the COVID-19 pandemic in determining the existence of impairment indicators for non-/fi.liganancial assets.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in line with its business model and in the context of the acceleration of the decarbonization of the generation mix and driving the energy-transition process, the Group has also carefully assessed whether climate change issues have a/ff.ligaected the reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable assumption used to estimate expected cash /fl.ligaows. In this regard, where necessary, the Group has also taken account of the long-term impact of climate change, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular by considering in the estimation of the terminal value a longterm growth rate in line with the change in electricity demand determined using energy models for each country. Information on the main assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount of assets with reference to the impacts relating to climate change, as well as information on changes in these assumptions, is provided in note 23 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Expected credit losses on /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, contract assets and all other assets in scope.\n\nLoss allowances for /fi.liganancial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and on the measurement of expected credit losses. Management uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs for the impairment calculation, based on the Group's past experience, current market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period.\n\nThe expected credit loss (i.e., ECL) - determined considering probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) - is the di/ff.ligaerence between all contractual cash /fl.ligaows that are due in accordance with the contract and all cash /fl.ligaows that are expected to be received (including all sho/r\\_t.ligafalls) discounted at the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate (EIR).\n\nIn  pa/r\\_t.ligaicular,  for  trade  receivables,  contract  assets  and lease  receivables,  including  those  with  a  signi/fi.ligacant  /fi.liganancial component, the Group applies the simpli/fi.ligaed ap-",

Accordingly, /fi.liganancial assets that are more than 90 days past due are generally not considered to be in default, except for some speci/fi.ligac regulated markets.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets the Group mainly applies a collective approach based on grouping trade receivables and contract assets into speci/fi.ligac clusters, taking into account the speci/fi.ligac regulatory and business context. Only if the trade receivables are deemed to be individually signi/fi.ligacant by management and there is speci/fi.ligac information about any signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk, does the Group apply an analytical approach.\n\nIn case of individual assessment, PD is mainly obtained from an external provider.\n\nConversely, for collective assessment, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and past due information, considering a speci/fi.ligac de/fi.liganition of default.\n\nBased on each business and local regulatory framework as well as di/ff.ligaerences in customer po/r\\_t.ligafolios also in terms of risk, default rates and recovery expectations, speci/fi.ligac clusters are de/fi.liganed.\n\nThe contract assets are considered to have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts.\n\nIn order to measure the ECL for trade receivables on a collective basis, as well as for contract assets, the Group considers the following assumptions related to ECL parameters:\n\n- \u00b7 LGD is a function of the default bucket's recovery rates, discounted at the EIR; and\n- \u00b7 PD, assumed as to be the average default rate, is calculated on a cluster basis and taking into consideration minimum 24 month historical data;\n- \u00b7 EAD is estimated as the carrying exposure at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date net of cash deposits, including invoices issued but not expired and invoices to be issued.\n\nBased  on  speci/fi.ligac  management  evaluations,  the  forward-looking  adjustment  can  be  applied  considering qualitative and quantitative information in order to re/fl.ligaect possible  future  events  and  macroeconomic  scenarios, which may a/ff.ligaect the risk of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio or the /fi.liganancial instrument.\n\nFor additional details on the key assumptions and inputs\n\nused please see note 46 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Depreciable amount of ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements of Italian hydroelectric plants subsequent to enactment of Law 134/2012\n\nLaw 134 of August 7, 2012 containing 'urgent measures for growth' (published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale of August 11, 2012), introduced a sweeping overhaul of the rules governing hydroelectric concessions. Among its various provisions, the law establishes that /fi.ligave years before the expiration of a major hydroelectric water diversion concession and in cases of lapse, relinquishment or revocation, where there is no prevailing public interest for a di/ff.ligaerent use of the water, incompatible with its use for hydroelectric generation, the competent public entity shall organize a public call for tenders for the award for consideration of the concession for a period ranging from 20 to a maximum of 30 years.\n\nIn order to ensure operational continuity, the law also governs the methods of transferring ownership of the business unit necessary to operate the concession, including all legal relationships relating to the concession, from the outgoing concession holder to the new concession holder, in exchange for payment of a price to be determined in negotiations between the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession holder and the grantor agency, taking due account of the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 for other prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, the market value, meaning replacement value, reduced by estimated depreciation for ordinary wear and tear.\n- \u00b7 for intake and governing works, penstocks and out/fl.ligaow channels, which under the consolidated law governing waters and electrical plants are to be relinquished free of charge (A/r\\_t.ligaicle 25 of Royal Decree 1775 of December 11, 1933), the revalued cost less government grants related to assets, also revalued, received by the concession holder for the construction of such works, depreciated for ordinary wear and tear;\n\nWhile acknowledging that the new regulations introduce impo/r\\_t.ligaant changes as to the transfer of ownership of the business unit with regard to the operation of the hydroelectric concession, the practical application of these principles faces di/ffi.ligaculties, given the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties that do not permit the formulation of a reliable estimate of the value that can be recovered at the end of existing concessions (residual value).\n\nAccordingly, management has decided it could not pro-\n\nduce a reasonable and reliable estimate of residual value. The fact that the legislation requires the new concession holder to make a payment to the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession holder prompted management to review the depreciation schedules for assets classi/fi.ligaed as to be relinquished free of charge prior to Law 134/2012 (until the year ended on December 31, 2011, given that the assets were to be relin-\n\n<!-- image -->",

If additional information becomes available to enable the calculation of residual value, the carrying amounts of the assets involved will be adjusted prospectively.\n\n## Determining the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nThe fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments is determined on the basis of prices directly observable in the market, where available, or, for unlisted /fi.liganancial instruments, using speci/fi.ligac valuation techniques (mainly based on present value) that maximize the use of observable market inputs. In rare circumstances where this is not possible, the inputs are estimated by management taking due account of the characteristics of the instruments being measured.\n\nFor more information on /fi.liganancial instruments measured at  fair  value,  please  see  note  50  'Assets  and  liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, the Group includes a measurement of credit risk, both of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay (Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and its own (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA), in order to adjust the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments for the corresponding amount of counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk, using the method discussed in note 50 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nChanges in the assumptions made in estimating the input data could have an impact on the fair value recognized for those instruments, especially in current conditions where markets are volatile and the economic outlook is highly unce/r\\_t.ligaain and subject to rapid change.\n\n## Development expenditure\n\nIn order to determine the recoverability of development expenditure, the recoverable amount is estimated making assumptions regarding any fu/r\\_t.ligaher cash out/fl.ligaow that is expected to be incurred before the asset is ready for use or sale, the discount rates to be applied and the expected period of bene/fi.ligats.\n\n## Pensions and other post-employment bene/fi.ligats\n\nSome  of  the  Group's  employees  pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate  in  pension plans o/ff.ligaering bene/fi.ligats based on their wage history and years of service. Ce/r\\_t.ligaain employees are also eligible for other post-employment bene/fi.ligat schemes.\n\nThe expenses and liabilities of such plans are calculated on the basis of estimates carried out by consulting actuaries, who use a combination of statistical and actuarial elements in their calculations, including statistical data on past years and forecasts of future costs. Other components of the estimation that are considered include mo/r\\_t.ligaality and retirement rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of wage increas-\n\nes, the in/fl.ligaation rate and trends in healthcare cost.\n\nThese estimates can di/ff.ligaer signi/fi.ligacantly from actual developments owing to changes in economic and market conditions, increases or decreases in retirement rates and the lifespan of pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, as well as changes in the e/ff.ligaective cost of healthcare.\n\nSuch di/ff.ligaerences can have a substantial impact on the quanti/fi.ligacation of pension costs and other related expenses.\n\nWith regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has carefully analyzed the possible impacts of the economic crisis generated by the emergency on the actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the actuarial liabilities and assets serving the plans.\n\nFor more details on the main actuarial assumptions adopted, please see note 38.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\nFor more details on provisions for risks and charges, please see note 39 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nNote 55 'Contingent assets and liabilities' also provides information regarding the most signi/fi.ligacant contingent assets and liabilities for the Group at year end.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe Group is involved in various civil, administrative and tax disputes connected with the normal pursuit of its activities that could give rise to signi/fi.ligacant liabilities. It is not always objectively possible to predict the outcome of these disputes. The assessment of the risks associated with this litigation is based on complex factors whose very nature requires recourse to management judgments, even when taking account of the contribution of external advisors assisting the Group, about whether to classify them as contingent liabilities or liabilities.\n\nProvisions have been recognized to cover all signi/fi.ligacant liabilities for cases in which legal counsel feels an adverse outcome is likely and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the expense can be made.\n\n## Obligations associated with generation plants, including decommissioning and site restoration\n\nGeneration activities may entail obligations for the operator with regard to future interventions that will have to be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed following the end of the operating life of the plant.\n\nSuch interventions may involve the decommissioning of plants and site restoration, or other obligations linked to the type of generation technology involved. The nature of such obligations may also have a major impact on the accounting treatment used for them.\n\nIn the case of nuclear power plants, where the costs regard both decommissioning and the storage of waste fuel and other radioactive materials, the estimation of the future cost is a critical process, given that the costs will",

This is the interest rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment. When no observable inputs are available, the Group estimates the IBR making assumptions to re/fl.ligaect the terms and conditions of the lease and ce/r\\_t.ligaain lessee-speci/fi.ligac estimates. One of the most signi/fi.ligacant judgments for the Group in adopting IFRS 16 is determining this IBR necessary to calculate the present value of the lease payments required to be paid to the lessor. The Group approach to determine an IBR is based on the assessment of the following\n\nthree key components:\n\n- \u00b7 the credit spread adjustment, in order to calculate an IBR that is speci/fi.ligac for the lessee considering any underlying Parent or other guarantee;\n- \u00b7 the risk free rate, that consider the currency /fl.ligaows of the lease payments, the economic environment where the lease contract has been negotiated and also the lease term;\n- \u00b7 the lease related adjustments, in order to re/fl.ligaect into the IBR calculation the fact that the discount rate is directly linked to the type of the underlying asset, rath-\n\n than being a general incremental borrowing rate. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the risk of default is mitigated for the lessors as they have the right to reclaim the underlying asset itself.\n\nFor more information on lease liabilities, please see note 46 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Income tax\n\n## Recovery of deferred tax assets\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements repo/r\\_t.liga deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses or tax credits usable in subsequent years and income components whose deductibility is deferred in an amount whose future recovery is considered by management to be highly probable.\n\nThe recoverability of such assets is subject to the achievement of future pro/fi.ligats su/ffi.ligacient to absorb such tax losses and to use the bene/fi.ligats of the other deferred tax assets. Signi/fi.ligacant management judgment is required to assess the probability of recovering deferred tax assets, considering all negative and positive evidence, and to determine the amount that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fi.ligats together with future tax planning strategies and the tax rates applicable at the date of reversal. However, where the Group should become aware that it is unable to recover all or pa/r\\_t.liga of recognized tax assets in future years, the consequent adjustment would be taken to pro/fi.ligat or loss in the year in which this circumstance arises.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each period. Deferred tax assets not recognized are reassessed at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date in order to verify the conditions for their recognition.\n\nWhere required, the Group monitored the recovery times of deferred tax assets as well as those relating to the reversal of deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences, if any, as a result of the greater unce/r\\_t.ligaainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor more detail in deferred tax assets recognized or not recognized, please see note 24 'Deferred tax assets and liabilities'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Management judgment\n\n## Identi/fi.ligacation of cash generating units (CGUs)\n\nFor impairment testing, if the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the Group identi/fi.ligaes the smallest group of assets that generate largely independent cash in/fl.ligaows. The smallest group of assets that generates cash in/fl.ligaows that are largely independent of the cash in/fl.ligaows from other assets or group of assets is a CGU. Identifying such CGUs involves management judgments regarding the speci/fi.ligac nature of the assets and the business involved (geographical segment, business segment, regulatory framework, etc.) and the evidence that the cash in/fl.ligaows of the group of assets are largely independent of those associated with other assets (or groups of assets). The assets of each CGU are also identi/fi.ligaed on the basis of\n\nthe manner in which management manages and monitors those assets within the business model adopted. In particular, the number and scope of the CGUs are updated systematically to re/fl.ligaect the impact of new business combinations and reorganizations carried out by the Group, and to take account of external factors that could in/fl.ligauence the ability of assets to generate independent cash in/fl.ligaows.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, if ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac identi/fi.ligaed assets owned by the Group are impacted by adverse economic or operating conditions that undermine their capacity to contribute to the generation of cash /fl.ligaows, they can be isolated from the rest of the assets of the CGU, undergo separate analysis of their recoverability and be impaired where necessary.\n\nThe CGUs identi/fi.ligaed by management to which the goodwill recognized in these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements has been allocated and the criteria used to identify the CGUs are indicated in note 23 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Determining the useful life of non-/fi.liganancial assets\n\nIn determining the useful life of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment and intangible assets with a /fi.liganite useful life, the Group considers not only the future economic bene/fi.ligats contained in the assets - obtained through their use, but also many other factors, such as physical wear and tear, the technical, commercial or other obsolescence of the product or service produced with the asset, legal or similar limits (e.g., safety, environmental or other restrictions) on the use of the asset, if the useful life of the asset depends on the useful life of other assets.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in estimating the useful lives of the assets concerned, the Group has taken account of its commitment under the Paris Agreement. For more information on this issue, please see note 18 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of control\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 10, control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns\n\nfrom its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a/ff.ligaect those returns through its power over the investee. Power is de/fi.liganed as the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee based on existing substantive rights.\n\nThe existence of control does not depend solely on ownership of a majority investment, but rather it arises from substantive rights that each investor holds over the investee. Consequently, management must use its judgment in assessing whether speci/fi.ligac situations determine substantive rights that give the Group the power to direct the relevant activities of the investee in order to a/ff.ligaect its returns.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing control, management analyzes all facts and circumstances including any agreements with other investors, rights arising from other contractual arrangements and potential voting rights (call options, warrants, put options granted to non-controlling shareholders, etc.). These other facts and circumstances could be  especially  signi/fi.ligacant  in  such  assessment  when  the Group holds less than a majority of voting rights, or similar rights, in the investee.\n\nFollowing such analysis of the existence of control, in application of IFRS 10 the Group consolidated ce/r\\_t.ligaain companies (Emgesa and Codensa) on a line-by-line basis even though it did not hold more than half of the voting rights, determining that the requirements for de facto control existed.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, even if it holds more than half of the voting rights in another entity, the Group considers all the relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it controls the investee.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of control.\n\n## Determination of the existence of joint control and of the type of joint arrangement\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 11, a joint arrangement is an agreement where two or more pa/r\\_t.ligaies have joint control. Joint control exists only when the decisions over the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that share joint control.\n\nA joint arrangement can be con/fi.ligagured as a joint venture or a joint operation. Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Conversely, joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that have joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nIn order to determine the existence of the joint control and the type of joint arrangement, management must apply judgment and assess its rights and obligations arising from the arrangement. For this purpose, the management considers the structure and legal form of the arrangement, the",

The Group re-assesses whether or not it has joint control if facts and circumstances indicate that changes have occurred in one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of joint control and the type of the joint arrangement.\n\nFor more information on the Group's investments in joint ventures,  please  see  note  25  'Equity-accounted  investments'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence over an associate\n\nAssociates are those in which the Group exercises signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, i.e., the power to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the /fi.liganancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not exercise control or joint control over those policies. In general, it is presumed that the Group has a signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence when it has an ownership interest of 20% or more.\n\nIn order to determine the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, management must apply judgment and consider all facts and circumstances.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it has signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence.\n\nFor more information on the Group's equity investments in associates, please see note 25 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Application of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements' to concessions\n\nIFRIC 12 applies to 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements, which can be de/fi.liganed as contracts under which the operator is obligated to provide public services, i.e., give access to major economic and social services for a ce/r\\_t.ligaain period of time, on behalf of a public entity (the grantor). In these contracts, the grantor conveys to an operator the right to manage the infrastructure used to provide services.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, IFRIC 12 gives guidance on the accounting by operators for 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements in the event that:\n\n- \u00b7 the grantor controls - through ownership, bene/fi.ligacial entitlement or otherwise - any signi/fi.ligacant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.\n- \u00b7 the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and\n\nIn assessing the applicability of these requirements for the Group, as operator, management carefully analyzed existing concessions.\n\nOn the basis of that analysis, the provisions of IFRIC 12 are applicable to some of the infrastructure of a number of companies that operate primarily in Brazil.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligaher details about the infrastructure used in the service concession arrangements in the scope of IFRIC 12 are provided in note 19 'Infrastructure within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements''.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nIn the process of applying IFRS 15, the Group has made the following judgments (fu/r\\_t.ligaher details about the most significant e/ff.ligaect on the Group's revenue are provided in note 10.a 'Revenue from sales and services').\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, during the year, the Group carefully monitored the e/ff.ligaects of the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties linked to the COVID-19 pandemic on the recognition of its revenue, in particular as regards the main areas a/ff.ligaected by signi/fi.ligacant judgments.\n\n## Identi/fi.ligacation of the contract\n\nThe Group carefully analyzes the contractual terms and conditions on a jurisdictional level in order to determine when a contract exists and the terms of that contract's enforceability so as to apply IFRS 15 only to such contracts.\n\nIdenti/fi.ligacation and satisfaction of pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations When  a  contract  includes  multiple  promised  goods  or services, in order to assess if they should be accounted for separately or as a group, the Group considers both the individual characteristics of goods/services and the nature of the promise within the context of the contract, also evaluating all the facts and circumstances relating to the speci/fi.ligac contract under the relevant legal and regulatory framework.\n\nTo evaluate when a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed, the Group evaluates when the control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer, assessed primarily from the perspective of the customer.\n\n## Determination of the transaction price\n\nThe Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances  in  determining  whether  a  contract  includes  variable consideration  (i.e.,  consideration  that  may  vary  or  depends upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event). In estimating variable consideration, the Group uses the method that be/t\\_t.ligaer predicts the consideration to which it will be entitled, applying it consistently throughout the contract and for similar contracts, also considering all available information, and updating such estimates until the unce/r\\_t.ligaainly is resolved. The Group includes the estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/fi.ligacant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty is resolved.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Principal versus agent assessment\n\nThe Group considers that it is an agent in some contracts in which it is not primarily responsible for ful/fi.ligalling the contract and therefore it does not control goods or services before they are being transferred to customers. For example, the Group acts as an agent in some contracts for electricity/gas network connection services and other related activities depending on local legal and regulatory framework.\n\n## Allocation of transaction price\n\nFor contracts that have more than one pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation (e.g., 'bundled' sale contracts), the Group generally allocates the transaction price to each pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to its stand-alone selling price. The Group determines stand-alone selling prices considering all information and using observable prices when they are available in the market or, if not, using an estimation method that maximizes the use of observable inputs and applying it consistently to similar arrangements.\n\nIf the Group evaluates that a contract includes an option for additional goods or services (e.g., customer loyalty programs or renewal options) that represents a material right, it allocates the transaction price to this option since the option gives rise to an additional pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.\n\n## Contract costs\n\nThe Group assesses recoverability of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract either on a contract-by-contract basis, or for a group of contracts if those costs are associated with the group of contracts.\n\nThe Group suppo/r\\_t.ligas the recoverability of such costs on the basis of its experience with other similar transactions and evaluating various factors, including potential renewals, amendments and follow-on contracts with the same customer.\n\nThe Group amo/r\\_t.ligaizes such costs over the average customer term. In order to determine this expected period of bene/fi.ligat from the contract, the Group considers its past experience (e.g., 'churn rate'), the predictive evidence from similar contracts and available information about the market.\n\n## Classi/fi.ligacation and measurement of /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, in order to classify /fi.liganancial assets as /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, management assesses both the contractual cash /fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing /fi.liganancial assets in order to generate cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nIn order to evaluate the contractual cash /fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument, management pe/r\\_f.ligaorms the SPPI test at an instrument level, in order to determine if it gives rise to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, per-\n\nforming speci/fi.ligac assessment on the contractual clauses of the /fi.liganancial instruments, as well as quantitative analysis, if required.\n\nThe business model determines whether cash /fl.ligaows will result from collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows, selling the /fi.liganancial assets, or both.\n\nFor more details, please see note 46 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is applied to derivatives in order to re/fl.ligaect into the /fi.liganancial statements the e/ff.ligaect of risk management strategies.\n\nAccordingly, at the inception of the transaction the Group documents the hedge relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy. The Group also assesses, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether hedging instruments are highly e/ff.ligaective in o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing changes in the fair values or cash /fl.ligaows of hedged items. On the basis of management's judgment, the e/ff.ligaectiveness assessment based on the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the dominance of credit risk in the changes in fair value and the hedge ratio, as well as the measurement of the ine/ff.ligaectiveness, is evaluated through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the speci/fi.ligac facts and circumstances and on the characteristics of the hedged items and the hedging instruments.\n\nFor cash /fl.ligaow hedges of forecast transactions designated as hedged items, management assesses and documents that they are highly probable and present an exposure to changes in cash /fl.ligaows that a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, during the year, the Group carefully monitored the possible e/ff.ligaects of the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties linked to the COVID-19 pandemic on its hedge relationships.\n\nFor additional details on the key assumptions about e/ff.ligaectiveness  assessment  and  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  measurement, please refer to note 49.1 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe complexity of the assessment of the lease contracts, and also their long-term expiring date, requires considerable professional judgments for application of IFRS 16. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, this regards:\n\n- \u00b7 the identi/fi.ligacation of the non-lease component in the lease;\n- \u00b7 the application of the de/fi.liganition of a lease to the cases typical of the sectors in which the Group operates;\n- \u00b7 the evaluation of any renewable and termination options included in the lease in order to determine the term of leases, also considering the probability of their exercise and any signi/fi.ligacant leasehold improvements on",

Related pa/r\\_t.ligaies also include entities that operate post-employment bene/fi.ligat plans for employees of Enel SpA or its associates (speci/fi.ligacally, the FOPEN and FONDENEL pension funds), as well as the members of the boards of statutory auditors, and their immediate family, and the key management personnel, and their immediate family, of Enel SpA and its subsidiaries. Key management personnel comprises management personnel who have the power and direct or indirect responsibility for the planning, management and control of the activities of the Company. They include directors (whether executive or not).\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity, regardless of the nature of the formal relationship between them, when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns deriving from its involvement and has the ability, through the exercise of its power over the investee, to a/ff.ligaect its returns.\n\nThe /fi.ligagures of the subsidiaries are consolidated on a full line-by-line basis as from the date control is acquired until such control ceases.\n\n## Consolidation procedures\n\nThe /fi.liganancial statements of subsidiaries used to prepare the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements were prepared at December 31, 2021 in accordance with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.\n\nIf  a  subsidiary  uses  di/ff.ligaerent  accounting  policies  from those  adopted  in  preparing  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements for similar transactions and facts in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to ensure conformity with Group accounting policies.\n\nAssets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in or excluded from the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, respectively, from the date the Group gains control or until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nPro/fi.ligat or loss for the year and the other comprehensive income are a/t\\_t.ligaributed to owners of the Parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in a loss for non-controlling interests.\n\nAll intercompany assets and liabilities, equity items, revenue, expenses and cash /fl.ligaows relating to transactions between entities of the Group are eliminated in full.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, with the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests adjusted to re/fl.ligaect changes in their interests in the subsidiary. Any di/ff.ligaerence between the amount to which non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in consolidated equity.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any interest retained in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, at the date when control is lost, recognizing any gain or loss from the loss of control through pro/fi.ligat or loss. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the former subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence. Signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence is the power to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in decisions concerning the /fi.liganancial and operating policies of the investee without having control or joint control over the investee.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement over which the Group exercises joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the sharing of control of an arrangement, whereby decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies sharing control.\n\nThe Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nUnder the equity method, these investments are initially recognized at cost and any goodwill arising from the di/ff.ligaerence between the cost of the investment and the Group's share of the net fair value of the investee's identi/fi.ligaable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nAfter the acquisition date, their carrying amount is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of pro/fi.ligat or loss of the associate or joint venture in Group pro/fi.ligat or loss. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be necessary following changes in the Group's share in the associate or joint venture as a result of changes in the other comprehensive income of the investee. The Group's share of these changes is recognized in the Group's other comprehensive income.\n\nDividends received from joint ventures and associates reduce the carrying amount of the investments.\n\nGains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture. The /fi.liganancial statements of the associates or joint ventures are prepared for the same repo/r\\_t.ligaing period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in an associate or joint venture. If there is objective evidence of a loss of value, the entire carrying amount of the investment undergoes impairment testing pursuant to IAS 36 as a single asset. For more information on impairment, please see the section 'Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets' in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nIf the investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture, the Group recognizes any retained investment at its fair value, through pro/fi.ligat or loss. Any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the former associate or joint venture are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nIf the ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture is\n\nreduced, but the Group continues to exercise a signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence or joint control, the Group continues to apply the equity method and the share of the gain or loss that had previously been recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction is accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nWhen a po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment in an associate or joint venture meets the criteria to be classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, any retained po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment in the associate or joint venture that has not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the po/r\\_t.ligaion classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale takes place.\n\nJoint  operations  are  joint  arrangements  whereby  the Group, which holds joint control, has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. For each joint operation, the Group recognized assets, liabilities, costs and revenue on the basis of the provisions of the arrangement rather than the interest held. Where there is an increase in the interest in a joint ar-\n\nrangement that meets the de/fi.liganition of a business:\n\n- \u00b7 if the Group obtains joint control (i.e., it already had an interest in a joint operation without holding joint control), the interest previously held in the joint operation shall not be remeasured.\n- \u00b7 if the Group acquires control, and had rights over the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement  immediately  before  the  acquisition  date, then the transaction represents a business combination achieved in stages. Consequently, the Group applies the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages, including the remeasurement of the interest it held previously in the joint operation at its fair value at the acquisition date;\n\nFor more information on the Group's investments in associates and joint ventures, please see note 25 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Translation of foreign currency items\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recognized at the spot exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency are subsequently translated using the closing exchange rate (i.e., the spot exchange rate prevailing at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date).\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are recognized at historical cost are translated  using  the  exchange  rate  at  the  date  of  the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined.

In order to prepare the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, the /fi.liganancial statements of consolidated companies with functional currencies other than the presentation currency used in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements are translated into euros by applying the closing exchange rate to the assets and liabilities, including goodwill and consolidation adjustments, and the average exchange rate for the period to the income statement items on the condition it approximates the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the respective transactions.\n\nAny resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized as a separate component of equity in a special reserve. The gains  and  losses  are  recognized  propo/r\\_t.ligaionately  in  the income statement on the disposal (pa/r\\_t.ligaial or total) of the subsidiary.\n\nWhen the functional currency of a consolidated company is the currency of a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy, the Group restates the /fi.liganancial statements in accordance with IAS 29 before applying the speci/fi.ligac conversion method set out below.\n\nIn order to consider the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the local currency exchange rate, the /fi.liganancial position and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance (i.e., assets, liabilities, equity items, revenue and expenses) of a company whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy are translated into the Group's presentation currency (the euro) using the exchange rate prevailing at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, except for comparative amounts presented in the previous year's /fi.liganancial statements which are not adjusted for subsequent changes in the price level or subsequent changes in exchange rates.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations  initiated  before  January  1,  2010 and completed within that /fi.liganancial year are recognized on the basis of IFRS 3 (2004).\n\nSuch business combinations were recognized using the purchase method, where the purchase cost is equal to the fair value at the date of the exchange of the assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed, plus costs directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition. This cost was allocated by recognizing the assets, liabilities and identi/fi.ligaable contingent liabilities of the acquired company at their fair values. Any positive di/ff.ligaerence between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired a/t\\_t.ligaributable to owners of the Parent was recognized as goodwill. If the difference is negative, it is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss. The carrying amount of non-controlling interests was determined in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-controlling shareholders in the net assets. In the case of business combinations achieved in stages, at the acquisition date, any adjustment to the fair value of the net assets acquired previously was recognized in equity; the amount of goodwill was determined for each transaction separately based on the fair values of the acquiree's net assets at the date of each exchange transaction.\n\nBusiness combinations carried out as from January 1, 2010 are recognized on the basis of IFRS 3 (2008), which is referred to as IFRS 3 (Revised) hereafter.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method, where the acquisition cost (the consideration transferred) is equal to the fair value at the acquisition date of the assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed, as well as any equity instruments issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nCosts directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe consideration transferred is allocated by recognizing the  assets,  liabilities  and  identi/fi.ligaable  contingent  liabilities of the acquired company at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree plus the fair value of any equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the Group (in a business combination achieved in stages) over the net amount of the identi/fi.ligaable assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed measured at fair value is recognized as goodwill. If the difference is negative, the Group veri/fi.ligaes whether it has correctly identi/fi.ligaed all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to determine the amounts to recognize at the acquisition date. If after this assessment the fair value of the net assets acquired still exceeds the total consideration transferred, this excess represents a gain on a bargain purchase and is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe carrying amount of non-controlling interests is determined either in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-con-\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the case of business combinations achieved in stages, at the date of acquisition of control the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value and any positive or negative di/ff.ligaerence is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration classi/fi.ligaed as an asset or a liability, or as a /fi.liganancial instrument within the scope of IFRS 9, are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IFRS 9, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS-EU. Contingent consideration that is classi/fi.ligaed as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent se/t\\_t.ligalement is accounted for within equity.\n\nIf the fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be calculated on a provisional basis, the business combination is recognized using such provisional values. Any adjustments resulting from the completion of the measurement process are recognized within 12 months of the acquisition date, restating comparative /fi.ligagures.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFor all fair value measurements and disclosures of fair value, that are either required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by IFRS, the Group applies IFRS 13.\n\nFair value is de/fi.liganed as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction, between market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price).\n\nThe fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability takes place in the principal market, i.e., the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability. In the absence of a principal market, it is assumed that the transaction takes place in the most advantageous market to which the Group has access, i.e., the market that maximizes the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimizes the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants act in their economic best interest. Market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants are independent, knowledgeable sellers and buyers who are able to enter into a transaction for the asset or the liability and who are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so.\n\nWhen measuring fair value, the Group considers the characteristics of the asset or liability, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular:\n\n- \u00b7 for a non-/fi.liganancial asset, a fair value measurement takes into account a market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant's ability to generate economic bene/fi.ligats by using the asset in its highest and\n- best use or by selling it to another market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant that would use the asset in its highest and best use;\n- \u00b7 in the case of groups of /fi.liganancial assets and /fi.liganancial liabilities with o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing positions in market risk or credit risk, managed on the basis of an entity's net exposure to such risks, it is permi/t\\_t.ligaed to measure fair value on a net basis.\n- \u00b7 for liabilities and own equity instruments, the fair value re/fl.ligaects the e/ff.ligaect of non-pe/r\\_f.ligaormance risk, i.e., the risk that an entity will not ful/fi.ligall an obligation, including among others the credit risk of the Group itself;\n\nIn measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities, the Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which su/ffi.ligacient data are available, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n## Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes expenses directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use.\n\nThe cost is also increased by the present value of the estimate of the costs of decommissioning and restoring the site on which the asset is located where there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so. The corresponding liability is recognized under provisions for risks and charges. The accounting treatment of changes in the estimate of these costs, the passage of time and the discount rate is discussed in note 39 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment transferred from customers to connect them to the electricity distribution network and/or to provide them with other related services is initially recognized at its fair value at the date on which control is obtained.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, i.e., an asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as pa/r\\_t.liga of the cost of the assets themselves. Borrowing costs associated with the purchase/construction of assets that do not meet such requirement are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nCe/r\\_t.ligaain assets that were revalued at the IFRS-EU transition date or in previous periods are recognized at their fair value, which is considered to be their deemed cost at the revaluation date.\n\nWhere individual items of major components of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment have di/ff.ligaerent useful lives, the components are recognized and depreciated separately.\n\nSubsequent costs are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic bene/fi.ligats associated with the cost incurred to replace a pa/r\\_t.liga of the asset will /fl.ligaow to the Group and the",

Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net disposal proceeds, determined in accordance with the transaction price requirements of IFRS 15, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\n## Assets to be relinquished free of charge\n\nThe Group's plants include assets to be relinquished free of charge at the end of the concessions. These mainly regard major water diversion works and the public lands used for the operation of the thermal power plants.\n\nWithin the Italian regulatory framework in force until 2011, if the concessions are not renewed, at those dates all intake and governing works, penstocks, out/fl.ligaow channels and other assets on public lands were to be relinquished free of charge to the State in good operating condition. Accordingly, depreciation on assets to be relinquished was calculated over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the term of the concession and the useful life of the assets.\n\nIn the wake of the legislative changes introduced with Law 134 of August 7, 2012, the assets previously classi/fi.ligaed as assets 'to be relinquished free of charge' connected with the  hydroelectric  water  diversion  concessions  are  now considered in the same manner as other categories of 'prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and are therefore depreciated over the useful life of the asset (where this exceeds the term of the concession), as discussed in the section above on the 'Depreciable amount of ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements of Italian hydroelectric plants subsequent to enactment of Law 134/2012', which you are invited to consult for more details.\n\nIn accordance with Spanish laws 29/1985 and 46/1999, hydroelectric power stations in Spanish territory operate under administrative concessions at the end of which the plants will be returned to the government in good operating condition. The terms of the concessions extend up to 2067.\n\nA number of generation companies that operate in Latin America hold administrative concessions with similar conditions to those applied under the Spanish concession system. These concessions will expire in 2071.\n\n## Infrastructure serving a concession not within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements'\n\nAs regards the distribution of electricity, the Group is a concession holder in Italy for this service. The concession, granted by the Ministry for Economic Development, was issued free of charge and terminates on December 31, 2030. If the concession is not renewed upon expiry, the grantor is required to pay an indemnity. The amount of the indemnity will be determined by agreement of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies\n\n<!-- image -->",

In such a case, the operator does not have an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent that the public uses the service.\n- \u00b7 a /fi.liganancial asset, if the Group has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another /fi.liganancial asset from the grantor (or from a third pa/r\\_t.ligay at the direction of the grantor), that is the grantor has li/t\\_t.ligale discretion to avoid payment. In this case, the grantor contractually guarantees to pay to the operator speci/fi.ligaed or determinable amounts or the sho/r\\_t.ligafall between the amounts received from the users of the public service and speci/fi.ligaed or determinable amounts (de/fi.liganed by the contract), and such payments are not dependent on the usage of the infrastructure; and/or\n\nIf the Group (as operator) has a contractual right to receive an intangible asset (a right to charge users of public service), borrowing costs are capitalized using the criteria speci/fi.ligaed in note 18 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment'.\n\nHowever, for construction/upgrade services, both types of consideration are generally classi/fi.ligaed as a contract asset during the construction/upgrade period.\n\nFor  more  details  about  such  consideration,  please  see note 10.a 'Revenue from sales and services'.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Group holds prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment for its various activities under lease contracts. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.\n\nFor contracts entered into or changed on or after January 1, 2019, the Group has applied the de/fi.liganition of a lease under IFRS 16, that is met if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fi.ligaed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nConversely, for contracts entered into before January 1, 2019,  the  Group  determined  whether  the  arrangement was or contained a lease under IFRIC 4.\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modi/fi.ligacation of a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use).\n\nThe right-of-use asset represents a lessee's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term; it is initially measured at cost, which includes the initial amount of lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to retire and remove the underlying asset and to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located. Right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets, as follows:\n\n|                                              |   Average residual life (years) |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Buildings                                    |                               7 |\n| Ground rights of renewable energy plants     |                              32 |\n| Vehicles and other means of transpo/r\\_t.liga |                               5 |\n\nIf the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group at the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset re/fl.ligaects the fact that the Group will exercise a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nIn addition, the right-of-use assets are subject to impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term.

        "page_content": "culating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date when the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. After the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest method and is remeasured upon the occurrence of ce/r\\_t.ligaain events. The Group applies the sho/r\\_t.liga-term lease recognition exemption to its lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the low-value assets recognition exemption to lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low-value whose amount is estimated not material. For example, the Group has leases of ce/r\\_t.ligaain o/ffi.ligace equipment (i.e., personal computers, printing and photocopying machines) that are considered of low-value. Lease payments on sho/r\\_t.liga-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the de/fi.liganition of investment prope/r\\_t.ligay in 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'Borrowings'.\n\nConsistent  with  the  requirement  of  the  standard,  the Group presents separately the interest expense on lease liabilities under 'Other /fi.liganancial expense' and the depreciation charge on the right-of-use assets under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and impairment losses'.\n\n## Group as a lessor\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at the lease inception date whether each lease is a /fi.liganance lease or an operating lease.\n\nLeases in which the Group essentially transfers all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the underlying asset are classi/fi.ligaed as /fi.liganance leases; otherwise, they are classi/fi.ligaed as operating leases. To make this assessment, the Group considers the indicators provided by IFRS 16. If a contract contains lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract applying IFRS 15.\n\nThe Group accounts for rental income arising from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and it recognizes it as other revenue.\n\n## Investment prope/r\\_t.ligay\n\nInvestment prope/r\\_t.ligay consists of the Group's real estate held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services.\n\nInvestment prope/r\\_t.ligay is measured at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nInvestment prope/r\\_t.ligay, excluding land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the related assets.\n\nImpairment losses are determined on the basis of the criteria described in the section below..\n\nThe breakdown of the fair value of investment prope/r\\_t.ligay is detailed in note 50 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nInvestment prope/r\\_t.ligay is derecognized either when it has been transferred (i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control) or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic bene/fi.ligat is expected from its disposal. Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net disposal proceeds, determined in accordance with the transaction price requirements of IFRS 15, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\nTransfers are made to (or from) investment prope/r\\_t.ligay only when there is a change in use.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are identi/fi.ligaable assets without physical substance controlled by the Group and capable of generating future economic bene/fi.ligats. They are measured at purchase or internal development cost when it is probable that the use of such assets will generate future economic bene/fi.ligats and the related cost can be reliably determined.\n\nThe cost includes any directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable expenses necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is recognized as an intangible asset only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the asset, its intention and ability to complete development and to use or sell the asset and the availability of resources to complete the asset.\n\nResearch costs are recognized as expenses.\n\nIntangible assets with a /fi.liganite useful life are recognized net of accumulated amo/r\\_t.ligaization and any impairment losses. Amo/r\\_t.ligaization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated useful life, which is reassessed at least annually; any changes in amo/r\\_t.ligaization policies are re/fl.ligaected on a prospective basis. For more information on estimating useful life, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nAmo/r\\_t.ligaization commences when the asset is ready for use. Consequently, intangible assets not yet available for use are not amo/r\\_t.ligaized, but are tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nThe Group's intangible assets have a /fi.liganite useful life, with the exception of a number of concessions and goodwill. Intangible assets with inde/fi.liganite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually.\n\nThe assessment of inde/fi.liganite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the inde/fi.liganite useful life continues to be suppo/r\\_t.ligaable.

Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net  consideration  received  in  the  disposal,  determined in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 15 concerning the transaction price, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\nThe estimated useful life of the main intangible assets, distinguishing between internally generated and acquired assets, is as follows:\n\n| Development expenditure: - internally generated             | 2-26 years   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| - acquired                                                  | 3-26 years   |\n| Industrial patents and intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay rights: |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | 3-10 years   |\n| - acquired                                                  | 2-50 years   |\n| Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights:       |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | 20 years     |\n| - acquired                                                  | 1-40 years   |\n| Intangible assets from service concession  arrangements:    |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | -            |\n| - acquired                                                  | 5 years      |\n| Other:                                                      |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | 2-28 years   |\n| - acquired                                                  | 1-28 years   |\n\nThe Group also presents costs to obtain a contract with a customer capitalized in accordance with IFRS 15 as intangible assets.\n\nThe Group recognized such costs as an asset only if:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group expects to recover them, through reimbursements (direct recoverability) or the margin (indirect recoverability).\n- \u00b7 the costs are incremental, that is they are directly attributable to an identi/fi.ligaed contract and the Group would not have incurred them if the contract had not been obtained;\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Group generally capitalizes trade fees and commissions paid to agents for such contracts if the capitalization criteria are met.\n\nCapitalized customer contract costs are amo/r\\_t.ligaized on a systematic basis, consistent with the pa/t\\_t.ligaern of the transfer of the goods or services to which they relate, and undergo impairment testing to identify any impairment losses to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset recognized exceeds the recoverable amount.\n\nThe Group amo/r\\_t.ligaizes the capitalized customer contract costs on a straight-line basis over the expected period of\n\nbene/fi.ligat from the contract (i.e., the average term of the customer relationship); any changes in amo/r\\_t.ligaization policies are re/fl.ligaected on a prospective basis.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the future economic bene/fi.ligats arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identi/fi.ligaed and separately recognized. For fu/r\\_t.ligaher details, please see the section of the accounting policies 'Business combinations'.\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognized separately. After initial recognition, goodwill is not amo/r\\_t.ligaized, but is tested for impairment at least annually as pa/r\\_t.liga of the CGU to which it pe/r\\_t.ligaains.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated, from the acquisition date, to each CGU that is expected to bene/fi.ligat from the synergies of the combination.\n\nGoodwill relating to equity investments in associates and joint ventures is included in their carrying amount.\n\n## Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, investment prope/r\\_t.ligay, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, goodwill and equity investments in associates/joint ventures are reviewed to determine whether there is evidence of impairment.\n\nCGUs to which goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are allocated are tested for recoverability annually or more frequently if there is evidence suggesting that the assets can be impaired.\n\nIf such evidence exists, the recoverable amount of any involved asset is estimated on the basis of the use of the asset and its future disposal, in accordance with the Group's most recent Business Plan. For the estimate of the recoverable amount, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash in/fl.ligaows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and therefore it is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or of a CGU to which it is allocated is greater than its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and presented under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and other impairment losses'.\n\nImpairment losses of CGUs are /fi.ligarstly charged against the carrying amount of any goodwill a/t\\_t.ligaributed to it and then against the other assets, in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to their carrying amount.\n\nIf the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss no longer apply, the carrying amount of the asset is re-",

Cost is determined on the basis of average weighted cost, which includes related ancillary charges. Net estimated realizable value is the estimated normal selling price net of estimated costs to sell or, where applicable, replacement cost.\n\nFor the po/r\\_t.ligaion of inventories held to discharge sales that have already been made, the net realizable value is determined on the basis of the amount established in the contract of sale.\n\nInventories include environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (for example, green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates, energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and European CO 2 emissions allowances) that were not utilized for compliance in the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period. As regards CO 2 emissions allowances, inventories are allocated between the trading po/r\\_t.ligafolio and the compliance po/r\\_t.ligafolio, i.e., those used for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions requirements. Within the la/t\\_t.ligaer, CO 2 emissions allowances are allocated to sub-po/r\\_t.ligafolios on the basis of the compliance year to which they have been assigned. Inventories also include nuclear fuel stocks, use of which is determined on the basis of the electricity generated. Materials and other consumables (including energy commodities) held for use in production are not wri/t\\_t.ligaen down if it is expected that the /fi.liganal product in which they will be incorporated will be sold at a price su/ffi.ligacient to enable recovery of the cost incurred.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are any contract that gives rise to a /fi.liganancial asset of one entity and a /fi.liganancial liability or equity instrument of another entity; they are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9.\n\nA /fi.liganancial asset or liability is recognized in the consolidated  /fi.liganancial  statements  when,  and  only  when,  the Group becomes pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contractual provision of the\n\ninstrument (i.e., the trade date).\n\nTrade receivables arising from contracts with customers, in the scope of IFRS 15, are initially measured at their transaction price (as de/fi.liganed in IFRS 15) if such receivables do not contain a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing component or when the Group applies the practical expedient allowed by IFRS 15.\n\nConversely, the Group initially measures /fi.liganancial assets other  than  the  above-mentioned  trade  receivables  at their fair value plus, in the case of a /fi.liganancial asset not measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, transaction costs.\n\nFinancial assets are classi/fi.ligaed, at initial recognition, as /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, on the basis of both the Group's business model and the contractual cash /fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument.\n\nFor this purpose, the assessment to determine whether the instrument gives rise to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding is referred to as the SPPI test and is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed at an instrument level.\n\nThe Group's business model for managing /fi.liganancial assets refers to how it manages its /fi.liganancial assets in order to generate cash /fl.ligaows. The business model determines whether cash /fl.ligaows will result from collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows, selling the /fi.liganancial assets, or both.\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, /fi.liganancial assets are classi/fi.ligaed in four categories:\n\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets at fair value through OCI with reclassi/fi.ligacation of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost (debt instruments);\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no reclassi/fi.ligacation of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); and\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes trade receivables, other /fi.liganancial assets and loan assets.\n\nFinancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost are held within a business model whose objective is to hold /fi.liganancial assets in order to collect contractual cash /fl.ligaows and whose contractual terms give rise, on speci/fi.ligaed dates, to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nSuch assets are initially recognized at fair value, adjusted for any transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest method and are subject to impairment.\n\nGains and losses are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss when the asset is derecognized, modi/fi.ligaed or impaired.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\n\nEquity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment testing.\n\nDividends on such investments are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss unless they clearly represent a recovery of a pa/r\\_t.liga of the cost of the investment.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss\n\nThis  category  mainly  includes:  securities,  equity  investments in other companies, /fi.liganancial investments in funds held for trading and /fi.liganancial assets designated as at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss at initial recognition.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss are:\n\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets held for trading because acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the sho/r\\_t.liga term;\n- \u00b7 /fi.liganancial assets with cash /fl.ligaows that are not solely payments of principal and interest, irrespective of the business model;\n- \u00b7 debt instruments designated upon initial recognition, under the option allowed by IFRS 9 (fair value option), if doing so eliminates, or signi/fi.ligacantly reduces, an accounting mismatch;\n- \u00b7 derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives,\n\nheld for trading or not designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments.\n\nSuch /fi.liganancial assets are initially recognized at fair value with subsequent gains and losses from changes in their fair value recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThis category also includes listed equity investments which the Group had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognized as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established.\n\nFinancial assets that qualify as contingent consideration are also measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Impairment of /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, the Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), contract assets and all other assets within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nIn compliance with IFRS 9, as from January 1, 2018, the Group adopted a new impairment model based on the determination of expected credit losses (ECL) using a forward-looking approach. In essence, the model provides for:\n\n- \u00b7 the recognition of expected credit losses on an ongoing basis and the updating of the amount of such losses at the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, re/fl.ligaecting changes in the credit risk of the /fi.liganancial instrument;\n- \u00b7 the application of a single framework for all /fi.liganancial assets;\n- \u00b7 the measurement of expected losses on the basis of reasonable information, obtainable without undue cost, about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions.\n\nFor trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, including those with a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancial component, the Group adopts the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, determining expected credit losses over a period corresponding to the entire life of the asset, generally equal to 12 months.\n\nFor all /fi.liganancial assets other than trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the Group applies the general approach under IFRS 9, based on the assessment of a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Under such approach, a loss allowance on /fi.liganancial assets is recognized at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, if the credit risk on those /fi.liganancial assets has increased signi/fi.ligacantly, since initial recognition, considering all reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information, including also forward-looking inputs.\n\nIf at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date the credit risk on /fi.liganancial assets has  not  increased  signi/fi.ligacantly  since  initial  recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for those /fi.liganancial assets at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.",

        "page_content": "For /fi.liganancial assets on which a loss allowance equal to lifetime expected credit losses has been recognized in the previous repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses when the condition regarding a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk is no longer met.\n\nThe Group recognizes in pro/fi.ligat or loss, as an impairment gain or loss, the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date to the amount that is required to be recognized in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group applies the low credit risk exemption, avoiding the recognition of loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses due to a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk of debt securities at fair value through OCI, whose counterpa/r\\_t.ligay has a strong /fi.liganancial capacity to meet its contractual cash /fl.ligaow obligations (e.g., investment grade). For more information on the impairment of /fi.liganancial assets, please see note 46 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThis category includes deposits that are available on demand or at very sho/r\\_t.liga term, as well as highly liquid sho/r\\_t.ligaterm /fi.liganancial investments that are readily conve/r\\_t.ligaible into a known amount of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nIn addition, for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows, cash and cash equivalents do not include bank overdrafts at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\n## Financial liabilities at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes borrowings, trade payables, lease liabilities and debt instruments.\n\nFinancial liabilities, other than derivatives, are recognized when the Group becomes a pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contractual clauses of the instrument and are initially measured at fair value adjusted for directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. The e/ff.ligaective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the /fi.liganancial instrument or a sho/r\\_t.ligaer period, where appropriate, to the carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset or liability.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss include /fi.liganancial liabilities held for trading and /fi.liganancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/fi.ligaed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative /fi.liganancial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as\n\nde/fi.liganed by IFRS 9. Separated embedded derivatives are also classi/fi.ligaed as at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss unless they are designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, only if the criteria in IFRS 9 are satis/fi.ligaed.\n\nIn this case, the po/r\\_t.ligaion of the change in fair value a/t\\_t.ligaributable to own credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group has not designated any /fi.liganancial liability as at\n\nfair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, upon initial recognition. Financial liabilities that qualify as contingent consideration are also measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized whenever one of the following conditions is met:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset, transferring its rights to receive the cash /fl.ligaows of the asset or assuming a contractual obligation to pay such cash /fl.ligaows to one or more bene/fi.ligaciaries under a contract that meets the requirements provided by IFRS 9 (the 'pass through test');\n- \u00b7 the contractual right to receive the cash /fl.ligaows associated with the asset expires;\n- \u00b7 the Group has not transferred or retained substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset but has transferred control over the asset.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, i.e., when the contractual obligation has been discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nWhen an existing /fi.liganancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially di/ff.ligaerent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi/fi.ligaed, such an exchange or modi/fi.ligacation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The di/ff.ligaerence in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Derivative /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nA derivative is a /fi.liganancial instrument or another contract:\n\n- \u00b7 that requires no initial net investment, or one that is smaller than would be required for a contract with similar response to changes in market factors;\n- \u00b7 whose value changes in response to the changes in an underlying variable such as an interest rate, commodity or security price, foreign exchange rate, a price or rate index, a credit rating or other variable;\n- \u00b7 that is se/t\\_t.ligaled at a future date.\n\nDerivative instruments are classi/fi.ligaed as /fi.liganancial assets or liabilities depending on the positive or negative fair value and they are classi/fi.ligaed as 'held for trading' within 'Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

For more details about derivatives and hedge accounting, please see note 49 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nAn  embedded  derivative  is  a  derivative  included  in  a 'combined' contract (the so-called 'hybrid instrument') that contains another non-derivative contract (the socalled 'host contract') and gives rise to some or all of the combined contract's cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nThe main Group contracts that may contain embedded derivatives are contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items with clauses or options that a/ff.ligaect the contract price, volume or maturity.\n\nA derivative embedded in a hybrid contract containing a /fi.liganancial asset host is not accounted for separately. The /fi.liganancial asset host together with the embedded derivative is required to be classi/fi.ligaed in its entirety as a /fi.liganancial asset at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nContracts that do not represent /fi.liganancial instruments to be measured at fair value are analyzed in order to identify any embedded derivatives, which are to be separated and measured at fair value. This analysis is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed when the Group becomes pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contract or when the contract is renegotiated in a manner that signi/fi.ligacantly changes the original associated cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives when:\n\n- \u00b7 the economic risks and characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- \u00b7 the host contract is not a /fi.liganancial instrument measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss;\n- \u00b7 a separate contract with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the de/fi.liganition of a derivative.\n\nEmbedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract  are  recognized  in  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements at fair value with changes recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss (except when the embedded derivative is pa/r\\_t.liga of a designated hedge relationship).\n\n## Contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items\n\nIn general, contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items that are entered into and continue to be held for receipt\n\nor delivery in accordance with the Group's normal expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are out of the scope of IFRS 9 and then recognized as executory contracts, according to the 'own use exemption'.\n\nA contract to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items is classi/fi.ligaed as 'normal purchase or sale' if it is entered into:\n\n- \u00b7 in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n- \u00b7 for the purpose of the physical se/t\\_t.ligalement;\n\nMoreover, contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement (for example, /fi.ligaxed-price forward contracts on energy commodities) do not qualify for the own use exemption and are recognized as derivatives measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss only if:\n\n- \u00b7 they are not entered into in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n- \u00b7 they can be se/t\\_t.ligaled net in cash; and\n\nThe Group recognizes the fair value gain or loss on contracts for the purchase or sale of energy commodities still outstanding at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date on a net basis under the item 'Net results from commodity contracts'.\n\nSubsequently, at the se/t\\_t.ligalement date:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value gain or loss on closed contracts for the purchase of energy commodities as well as the related cost, together with the impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss of the derecognition of the derivative, are recognized under 'Electricity, gas and fuel' and 'Services and other materials'.\n- \u00b7 the fair value gain or loss on closed contracts for the sale of energy commodities as well as the related revenue, together with the impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss of the derecognition of the derivative, are recognized under 'Other revenue';\n\nThe Group analyzes all contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial assets on an ongoing basis, with a speci/fi.ligac focus on forward purchases and sales of electricity and energy commodities, in order to determine if they shall be classi/fi.ligaed and treated in accordance with IFRS 9 or if they have been entered into for 'own use'.\n\n## O/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group o/ff.ligasets /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities when:\n\n- \u00b7 there is the intention of se/t\\_t.ligaling on a net basis or realizing the asset and se/t\\_t.ligaling the liability simultaneously.\n- \u00b7 there is a legally enforceable right to set o/ff.liga the recognized amounts; and\n\n## Hyperin/fl.ligaation\n\nIn a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy,  the  Group  adjusts non-monetary items, equity and items deriving from index-linked contracts up to the limit of recoverable amount, using a price index that re/fl.ligaects changes in general purchasing power.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaects of initial application are recognized in equity",

Conversely, during the hyperin/fl.ligaationary period (until it ceases), the gain or loss resulting from adjustments is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and disclosed separately in /fi.liganancial income and expense.\n\nSta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2018, this standard applies to the Group's transactions in Argentina, whose economy has been declared hyperin/fl.ligaationary from July 1, 2018.\n\n## Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  are  classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use.\n\nThis  classi/fi.ligacation criterion  is  applicable  only  when non-current assets (or disposal groups) are available in their present condition for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable.\n\nIf the Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary and the requirements provided for under IFRS 5 are met, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale when the classi/fi.ligacation criteria are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nThe Group applies these classi/fi.ligacation criteria as envisaged in IFRS 5 to an investment, or a po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment, in an associate or a joint venture. Any retained po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment in an associate or a joint venture that has not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the po/r\\_t.ligaion that is classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale takes place.\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) and liabilities of disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the statement of /fi.liganancial position.\n\nThe amounts presented for non-current assets or for the assets and liabilities of disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are not reclassi/fi.ligaed or re-presented for prior periods presented.\n\nImmediately before the initial classi/fi.ligacation of non-current assets (or disposal groups) as held for sale, the carrying amounts of such assets (or disposal groups) are measured in accordance with the accounting standard applicable to those assets or liabilities. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses for any initial or subsequent write-down of the assets (or disposal groups) to fair value less costs to sell and gains for their reversals are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations.\n\nNon-current assets are not depreciated (or amo/r\\_t.ligaized)\n\nwhile they are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale or while they are pa/r\\_t.liga of a disposal group classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale.\n\nIf the classi/fi.ligacation criteria are no longer met, the Group ceases  to  classify  the  non-current  assets  (or  disposal groups) as held for sale. In this case they are measured at the lower of:\n\n- \u00b7 the recoverable amount, which is equal to the greater of its fair value net of costs to sell and its value in use, as calculated at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.\n- \u00b7 the  carrying  amount  before  the  asset  (or  disposal group) was classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization or reversals of impairment losses that would have been recognized if the asset (or disposal group) had not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale; and\n\nAny adjustment to the carrying amount of a non-current asset that ceases to be classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is included in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been disposed of, or is classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, and:\n\n- \u00b7 is pa/r\\_t.liga of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major business line or geographical segment; or\n- \u00b7 represents  a  separate  major  business  line  or  geographical segment;\n- \u00b7 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nThe Group presents, in a separate line item of the income statement, a single amount comprising the total of:\n\n- \u00b7 the post-tax gain or loss recognized on the measurement at fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal groups constituting the discontinued operation.\n- \u00b7 the post-tax pro/fi.ligat or loss of discontinued operations; and\n\nThe  corresponding  amount  is  restated  in  the  income statement  for  prior  periods  presented  in  the  /fi.liganancial statements, so that the disclosures relate to all operations that are discontinued by the end of the current repo/r\\_t.ligaing period. If the Group ceases to classify a component as held for sale, the results of the component previously presented in discontinued operations are reclassi/fi.ligaed and included in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations for all periods presented.\n\n## Environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nSome Group companies are a/ff.ligaected by national regulations governing green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (so-called 'white ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates'), as well as the EU Emissions Trading System.\n\nGreen  ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates  accrued  in  propo/r\\_t.ligaion  to  electricity generated by renewable energy plants and energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates accrued in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to energy sav-\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, charges incurred for obtaining (in the market or in some other transaction for consideration) any missing ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates to ful/fi.ligal compliance requirements for the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss on an accruals basis under other operating costs, as they represent 'system charges' consequent to compliance with a regulatory requirement.\n\n## Employee bene/fi.ligats\n\nLiabilities related to employee bene/fi.ligats paid upon or after ceasing employment in connection with de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans or other long-term bene/fi.ligats accrued during the employment period are determined separately for each plan, using actuarial assumptions to estimate the amount of the future bene/fi.ligats that employees have accrued at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date (using the projected unit credit method). More speci/fi.ligacally, the present value of the de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation is calculated by using a discount rate determined on the basis of market yields at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period on high-quality corporate bonds. If there is no deep market for high-quality corporate bonds in the currency in which the bonds are denominated, the corresponding yield of government securities is used.\n\nThe liability, net of any plan assets, is recognized on an accruals  basis  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  related rights. These appraisals are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed by independent actuaries.\n\nIf the plan assets exceed the present value of the related de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation, the surplus (up to the limit of any cap) is recognized as an asset.\n\nAs regards the liabilities/(assets) of de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans, the cumulative actuarial gains and losses from the ac-\n\ntuarial measurement of the liabilities, the return on the plan assets (net of the associated interest income) and the e/ff.ligaect of the asset ceiling (net of the associated interest) are recognized in other comprehensive income when they occur. For other long-term bene/fi.ligats, the related actuarial gains and losses are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn the event of a change being made to an existing de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plan or the introduction of a new plan, any past service cost is recognized immediately in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn addition, the Group is involved in de/fi.liganed contribution plans under which it pays /fi.ligaxed contributions to a separate entity (a fund) and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay fu/r\\_t.ligaher contributions if the fund does not hold su/ffi.ligacient assets to pay all employee bene/fi.ligats relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Such  plans  are  usually  aimed  to  supplement  pension bene/fi.ligats due to employees post-employment. The related costs are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss on the basis of the amount of contributions paid in the period.\n\n## Termination bene/fi.ligats\n\nLiabilities for bene/fi.ligats due to employees for the early termination of employee service arise out of the Group's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date or an employee's decision to accept an o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats in exchange for the termination of employment. The event that gives rise to an obligation is the termination of employment rather than employee service. Termination bene/fi.ligats are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- \u00b7 when the entity recognizes a cost for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination bene/fi.ligats.\n- \u00b7 when the entity can no longer withdraw its o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats; and\n\nThe liabilities are measured on the basis of the nature of the employee bene/fi.ligats. More speci/fi.ligacally, when the bene/fi.ligats represent an enhancement of other post-employment bene/fi.ligats, the associated liability is measured in accordance with the rules governing that type of bene/fi.ligats. Otherwise, if the termination bene/fi.ligats due to employees are expected to be fully se/t\\_t.ligaled before 12 months of the close of the period in which the bene/fi.ligats are recognized, the entity measures the liability in accordance with the requirements for sho/r\\_t.liga-term employee bene/fi.ligats; if they are not expected to be fully se/t\\_t.ligaled before 12 months of the close of period in which the bene/fi.ligats are recognized, the entity measures the liability in accordance with the requirements for other long-term employee bene/fi.ligats.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe  Group  unde/r\\_t.ligaakes  share-based  payment  transactions se/t\\_t.ligaled with equity instruments as pa/r\\_t.liga of the remu-",

The most recent long-term incentive plans provide for the grant to recipients of an incentive represented by an equity component and a monetary component.\n\nIn order to se/t\\_t.ligale the equity component through the bonus award of Enel shares, a program for the purchase of treasury shares to suppo/r\\_t.liga these plans was approved. For more details on share-based incentive plans, please see note 51 'Share-based payments'.\n\nThe Group recognizes the services rendered by employees as personnel expenses and indirectly estimates their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, on the basis of the fair value of the equity instruments (i.e., Enel shares) at the grant date. This fair value is based on the observable market price of Enel (on the Mercato Telematico Azionario (electronic stock exchange) organized and operated by Borsa Italiana SpA), taking account of the terms and conditions under which the shares were granted (with the exception of vesting conditions excluded from the measurement of fair value).\n\nThe cost of these share-based payment transactions settled with equity instruments is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, with a balancing entry in a speci/fi.ligac equity item, over the period in which the service and return pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions are met (vesting period).\n\nThe overall expense recognized is adjusted at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date until the vesting date to re/fl.ligaect the best estimate available to the Group of the number of equity instruments for which the service and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions will be satis/fi.ligaed, so that the amount recognized at the end is based on the e/ff.ligaective number of equity instruments that satisfy the service and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions at the vesting date.\n\nNo expense is recognized for awards which ultimately do not vest because the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions and/or the service conditions have not been satis/fi.ligaed. Conversely, the transactions are considered to have vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting conditions are satis/fi.ligaed, provided that all the other pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and/or service conditions are satis/fi.ligaed.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\nProvisions are recognized where there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the se/t\\_t.ligalement of which is expected to result in an out/fl.ligaow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. Where the impact is signi/fi.ligacant, the accruals are determined by discounting expected future cash /fl.ligaows using a pre-tax discount rate that re/fl.ligaects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, if applicable, the risks speci/fi.ligac to the liability.\n\nIf the provision is discounted, the periodic adjustment of the present value for the time factor is recognized as a /fi.liganancial expense.\n\nWhen the Group expects some or all charges to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is vi/r\\_t.ligaually ce/r\\_t.ligaain. Where the liability relates to decommissioning and/or site restoration in respect of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, the initial recognition of the provision is made against the related asset and the expense is then recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss through the depreciation of the asset involved. Where the liability regards the treatment and storage of nuclear waste and other radioactive materials, the provision is recognized against the related operating costs. A liability for restructuring refers to a program planned and controlled by management that materially changes the scope of a business unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by the Group or the manner in which the business is conducted. Such a liability is recognized when a constructive obligation is established, i.e., when the Group has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan and has sta/r\\_t.ligaed to implement the plan or has announced its main features to those af-\n\nfected by it.\n\nProvisions do not include liabilities in respect of unce/r\\_t.ligaain income tax treatments that are recognized as tax liabilities.\n\nThe Group could provide a warranty in connection with the sale of a product (whether a good or service) from contracts with customers in the scope of IFRS 15, in accordance with the contract, the law or its customary business practices. In this case, the Group assesses whether the warranty provides the customer with assurance that the related product will function as the pa/r\\_t.ligaies intended because it complies with agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations or whether the warranty provides the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations.\n\nAfter the assessment, if the Group establishes that an assurance warranty is provided, it recognizes a separate warranty liability and corresponding expense when transferring the product to the customer, as additional costs of providing goods or services, without a/t\\_t.ligaributing any of the transaction price (and therefore revenue) to the warranty. The liability is measured and presented as a provision.\n\nOtherwise, if the Group determines that a service warranty is provided, it accounts for the promised warranty as a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in accordance with IFRS 15, recognizing the contract liability as revenue over the period the warranty service is provided and the costs associated as they are incurred.\n\nFinally, if the warranty includes both an assurance element and a service element and the Group cannot reasonably account for them separately, then it accounts for both of the warranties together as a single pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In the case of contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic bene/fi.ligats expected to be received under it (onerous contracts), the Group recognizes a provision as the lower of the excess of unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract over the economic bene/fi.ligats expected to be received under it and any compensa-\n\ntion or penalty arising from failure to ful/fi.ligal it.\n\nChanges in estimates of accruals to the provisions addressed here are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss in the period in which the changes occur, with the exception of those in the costs of decommissioning, retiring and/or restoration resulting from changes in the timetable and costs necessary to extinguish the obligation or from a change in the discount rate. These changes increase or decrease the carrying amount of the related assets and are taken to pro/fi.ligat or loss through depreciation. Where they increase the carrying amount of the assets, it is also determined whether the new carrying amount of the assets is fully recoverable. If this is not the case, a loss equal to the unrecoverable amount is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nDecreases in estimates are recognized up to the carrying amount of the assets. Any excess is recognized immediately in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFor more information on the estimation criteria adopted in determining provisions for retiring and/or restoration of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, especially those associated with decommissioning nuclear power plants and storage  of  waste  fuel  and  other  radioactive  materials, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers in order to represent the transfer of promised goods or services to the customers at an amount that re/fl.ligaects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group applies this core principle using a /fi.ligave-step model:\n\n- \u00b7 identify the contract with the customer (step 1). The Group applies IFRS 15 to contracts with customers in the scope of the standard when the contract is legally enforceable and all the criteria envisaged for step 1 are met: If the criteria are not met, any consideration received from the customer is generally recognized as an ad-\n- vance;\n- \u00b7 identify the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations in the contract (step 2).\n\nThe Group identi/fi.ligaes all goods or services promised in the contract, separating them into pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations to account for separately if they are both: ca-\n\npable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract.\n\nAs an exception, the Group accounts for as a single pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the  same  pa/t\\_t.ligaern  of  transfer  to  the  customer  over time.\n\nIn assessing the existence and the nature of the performance obligations, the Group considers all of the contract's features as mentioned in step 1.\n\nFor each distinct good or service identi/fi.ligaed, the Group determines whether it acts as a principal or agent, respectively if it controls or not the speci/fi.ligaed good or service that is promised to the customer before its control is transferred to the customer. When the Group acts as agent, it recognizes revenue on a net basis,  corresponding  to  any  fee  or  commission  to which it expects to be entitled;\n\n- \u00b7 allocate the transaction price (step 4).\n- \u00b7 determine the transaction price (step 3). The transaction price represents the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third pa/r\\_t.ligaies (e.g., some sale taxes and value-added taxes). The Group determines the transaction price at inception of the contract and updates it each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period for any changes in circumstances. When the Group determines the transaction price, it considers whether the transaction price includes variable consideration, non-cash consideration received from a customer, consideration payable to a customer and a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing component;\n- The Group allocates the transaction price at contract inception  to  each  separate  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  obligation to depict the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services.\n\nWhen  the  contract  includes  a  customer  option  to acquire additional goods or services that represents a material right, the Group allocates the transaction price to this pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation (i.e., the option) and  defers  the  relative  revenue  until  those  future goods or services are transferred or the option expires.\n\nThe Group generally allocates the transaction price on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service promised in the contract (that is, the price at which the Group would sell that good or service separately to the customer);\n\n- \u00b7 recognize revenue (step 5). The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) each pe/r\\_f.ligaor-\n- mance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed by transferring the promised good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service.",

The cost incurred method (cost-to-cost method) is considered appropriate for measuring progress, except when speci/fi.ligac contract analyses suggest the use of an alternative method, which be/t\\_t.ligaer depicts the Group's pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation ful/fi.ligalled at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n- -revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the point in time at which the customer obtains the control of goods if the Group considers that the sale of goods is satis/fi.ligaed at a point in time;\n\nThe Group does not disclose the information about the remaining pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations in existing contracts if the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is pa/r\\_t.liga of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and if the Group recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer.\n\nMore information on the application of this revenue recognition model is provided in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment' and in note 10.a 'Revenue from sales and services'.\n\nIf the Group pe/r\\_f.ligaorms by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays the consideration or before payment is due, it recognizes a contract asset relating to the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer.\n\nIf a customer pays the consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, the Group recognizes a contract liability when the payment is made\n\n(or the payment is due) that is recognized as revenue when the Group pe/r\\_f.ligaorms under the contract.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue other than that deriving from contracts with customers mainly referring to:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of se/t\\_t.ligaled contracts to sell energy commodities with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement, which do not qualify for the own use exemption and therefore are recognized at FVTPL in accordance with IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 revenue from the sale of energy commodities based on contracts with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement, which do not qualify for the own use exemption and therefore is recognized at FVTPL in accordance with IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 operating lease revenue accounted for on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant lease agreement.\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income primarily includes gains on disposal of assets that are not an output of the Group's ordinary activities and government grants.\n\nGrants related to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with all conditions a/t\\_t.ligaaching to them as set by the government, government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international.\n\nWhen loans are provided by governments at a below-market rate of interest, the bene/fi.ligat is regarded as a government grant. The loan is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the government grant is measured as the di/ff.ligaerence between the initial carrying amount of the loan and the funds received. The loan is subsequently measured in accordance with the requirements for /fi.liganancial liabilities.\n\nGovernment grants are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognizes as expenses the costs that the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nWhere the Group receives government grants in the form of a transfer of a non-monetary asset for the use of the Group, it accounts for both the grant and the asset at the fair value of the non-monetary asset received at the date of the transfer.\n\nCapital grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, i.e., those received to purchase, build or otherwise acquire non-current assets (for example, an item of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment or an intangible asset), are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss over the depreciable/amo/r\\_t.ligaizable life of the asset as a reduction in the depreciation/amo/r\\_t.ligaization charge.

For more information concerning the recoverability of such assets, please see the appropriate section of the discussion of estimates.\n\nDeferred taxes and liabilities are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss, with the exception of those in respect of items recognized outside pro/fi.ligat or loss that are recognized in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are o/ff.ligaset only if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ff.ligaset current tax assets with current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or di/ff.ligaerent taxable entities which intend either to se/t\\_t.ligale current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and se/t\\_t.ligale the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which signi/fi.ligacant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled or recovered.\n\n## Unce/r\\_t.ligaainty over income tax treatments\n\nIn de/fi.liganing 'unce/r\\_t.ligaainty', it shall be considered whether a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular tax treatment will be accepted by the relevant taxation authority. If it is deemed probable that the tax treatment will be accepted (where the term 'probable' is de/fi.liganed as 'more likely than not'), then the Group recognizes and measures its current/deferred tax asset or liabilities applying the requirements in IAS 12.\n\nConversely, when the Group feels that it is not likely that the taxation authority will accept the tax treatment for income tax purposes, the Group re/fl.ligaects the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty in the manner that best predicts the resolution of the unce/r\\_t.ligaain tax treatment.

New and amended standards and interpretations\n\nThe Group has applied the following standards, interpretations and amendments that took e/ff.ligaect as from January 1, 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2', issued in August 2020. The amendments supplement those issued in 2019 (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1) and address issues that could a/ff.ligaect /fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing after a benchmark has been reformed or replaced with an alternative benchmark rate. The objectives of the Phase 2 amendments are to assist companies: (i) in applying the IFRSs when changes occur in contractual cash /fl.ligaows or hedge relationships due to the reform of the benchmarks for determining interest rates; and (ii) in providing information to users of /fi.liganancial statements.\n\nIn addition, when the Phase 1 exemptions cease to apply, companies are required to amend the documentation of hedge relationship to re/fl.ligaect the changes required under the IBOR reform by the end of the year in which the changes are made (such changes do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedge relationship). When the description of a hedged element in the documentation of the hedge relationship is changed, the amounts accumulated in the hedging reserve shall be considered to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on the basis of which the future hedged cash /fl.ligaows will be determined.\n\nThe amendments will require providing additional disclosures about the entity's exposure to the risks arising from the interest rate benchmark reform and related risk management activities.\n\n- \u00b7 'Amendment to IFRS 16: COVID 19-related rent concessions  beyond  30  June  2021' ,  issued  on  May  28, 2020 in order to permit lessees to not account for rent concessions (rent payment holidays, deferral of lease payments, reductions in rent for a period of time, possibly followed by rent increases in future periods) as lease modi/fi.ligacations if they are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions. According to IFRS 16, a lease modi/fi.ligacation is a change in the scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not pa/r\\_t.liga of the original terms and conditions of the lease. Accordingly, rent concessions would represent lease modi/fi.ligacations unless they were provided for in the original lease agreement. The amendment applies only to lessees, while lessors are required to apply the current provisions of IFRS 16.\n\nThe amendment was to be applied until June 30, 2021 but, in consideration of the persistence of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2021, the IASB extended the period of application of the practical expedient to June 30, 2022.\n\nThe application of the amendments did not have a material impact on these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements.\n\n## 4. Argentina - Hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy: impact of the application of IAS 29\n\nAs from July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy has been considered hyperin/fl.ligaationary based on the criteria established by 'IAS 29 - Financial repo/r\\_t.ligaing in hyperin/fl.ligaationary economies'. This designation is determined following an assessment of a series of qualitative and quantitative circumstances, including the presence of a cumulative in/fl.ligaation rate of more than 100% over the previous three years.\n\nFor the purposes of preparing the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2021, and in accordance with IAS 29, ce/r\\_t.ligaain items of the statements of /fi.liganancial position of the investees in Argentina have been remeasured by applying the general consumer price index to historical data in order to re/fl.ligaect changes in the purchasing power of the Argentine peso at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date for those companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

COVID-19 disclosures\n\nIn view of the challenges posed by current circumstances,  the  Group  carefully  monitors  the  evolution  of  the COVID-19 pandemic with regard to the main areas and countries in which it operates, in line with the recommendations of ESMA primarily contained in the public statements (24) published in March, May, July and October 2020, and of CONSOB in its warning notices nos. 6/2020 of April 9, 2020, 8/2020 of July 16, 2020 and 1/2021 of February 16, 2021.\n\nThe Group analyzed the impacts of COVID-19 on business operations, the /fi.liganancial position and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, also identifying the main risks and unce/r\\_t.ligaainties to which\n\nit is exposed.\n\nNote also that, due to the continuing unce/r\\_t.ligaainty regarding the future evolution of the macroeconomic, /fi.liganancial and business environment in which the Group operates, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for the purposes of the Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga at December 31, 2021 are  re/fl.ligaected  in  the  assessments  and  estimates  made by management concerning the carrying amount of the income statement items, assets and liabilities that experience the greatest volatility (in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, revenue and costs, prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, goodwill, employee bene/fi.ligats, and /fi.liganancial instruments).\n\n## 7. Restatement of comparative disclosures\n\n## Reclassi/fi.ligacation of commodity contracts with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement\n\nIn order to improve the representation of contracts entered into for the purchase or sale of commodities with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement (that do not qualify for the own use exemption) measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss (within the scope of IFRS 9), the Group modi/fi.ligaed their presentation in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements in 2021.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 the unrealized fair value gain or loss on energy commodity purchase contracts outstanding at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date were presented under 'Electricity, gas and fuel' and 'Services and other materials'.\n- \u00b7 the unrealized fair value gain or loss on energy commodity sales contracts outstanding at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date were presented under 'Revenue from sales and services';\n\nIn 2021, the unrealized fair value gain or loss on contracts for  the  purchase  or  sale  of  energy  commodities  outstanding at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date are recognized on a net basis under the item 'Net results from commodity contracts'.\n\nThe new presentation method constitutes a change in ac-\n\ncounting policy, in accordance with 'IAS 8 - Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors'. Accordingly, it was necessary to restate the income statement balances for previous periods for comparative purposes only, with no impact on either net pro/fi.ligat or equity.\n\n## Reclassi/fi.ligacation of the remeasurement at fair value of assets in respect of concession arrangements (IFRIC 12) in Brazil\n\nIn order to improve the representation of the remeasurement  at  fair  value  of  /fi.liganancial  assets  in  respect  of concession arrangements within the scope of application of IFRIC 12 in Brazil in pro/fi.ligat or loss, in 2021, the gain was reclassi/fi.ligaed from /fi.liganancial income to revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15) since it refers to the remeasurement at fair value of contract assets.\n\nThat said, the following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the reclassi/fi.ligacations made to costs, revenue, net results from commodity contracts and /fi.liganancial income in order to restate the comparative /fi.ligagures at December 31, 2020.",

The increase mainly re/fl.ligaects higher sales volumes and prices, mainly in Italy (\u20ac7,367 million), Brazil (\u20ac2,037 million) and Spain (\u20ac2,058 million), where the rise was also due to the recognition of an indemnity paid to Endesa (\u20ac186 million) in relation to the CO 2 emission rights assigned free of charge under the ' Plan Nacional de Asignaci\u00f3n de Derechos de Emisi\u00f3n ' (PNA).\n\n'Transfers from institutional market operators' decreased by \u20ac562 million compared with the previous year, mainly due to a decline in compensation for extra-peninsular generation in Spain following an increase in prices.\n\nRevenue from the 'Sale of gas' in 2021 amounted to \u20ac4,823 million (\u20ac2,718 million in 2020), an increase of \u20ac2,105 million\n\ncompared with the previous year. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in quantities sold in Spain.\n\nRevenue from the 'Sale of fuel' increased by \u20ac1,189 million, especially by Enel Global Trading due to the rise in gas prices.\n\nThe increase in the 'Sale of commodities under contracts with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement' (\u20ac16,801 million) mainly regards gas sales. This positive e/ff.ligaect was pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by the deterioration in pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the measurement of contracts settled in 2021 (-\u20ac12,049 million), mainly involving gas contracts.\n\nThe following table shows the net fair value gain or loss on contracts  for  the  sale  or  purchase  of  commodities  with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss within the scope of IFRS 9.",

Capital expenditure on generation plants mainly regards solar plants and wind farms in the United States, Colombia, Iberia, Italy, India, Chile and Russia.\n\nIn order to respond to ever more variable climate developments and, therefore, enhance the resilience of grids, the Group continued to invest in the Distribution Business Line (\u20ac4,389 million). The \u20ac1,101 million increase is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to greater investments in Italy, Brazil and Iberia for the Grid Blue Sky project (a new platform operating model that envisages the redesign of systems, processes and work organization to leverage assets more e/ff.ligaectively, including through the use of a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence) and for quality and remote control activities.\n\nIn Italy, following the introduction of measures to revive the economy and to encourage energy upgrading and seismic  resilience,  Enel  X  has  unde/r\\_t.ligaaken  greater  investments in the development of the e-Home business associated with the Vivi Meglio initiative, while in Spain e-Home posted an increase as a result of greater sales volumes compared with 2020. In No/r\\_t.ligah America and Korea, its investments in storage increased.\n\nExchange gains amounted to \u20ac228 million.\n\nThe 'Change in the consolidation scope' in 2021 mainly refers to the consolidation of the Australian renewables companies, which had previously been equity-accounted, following changes in governance arrangements with-\n\nout the purchase of additional interests, as well as the acquisition of 30 renewable energy companies by Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a.\n\n'Impairment losses' amounted to \u20ac2,784 million and are mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the energy-transition process initiated by the Group, which in 2021 led to the recognition of impairment losses on the Italian thermal generation plants of Torrevaldaliga Nord, Fusina, La Spezia and Brindisi, the Spanish generation plants of Baleares, Canarias, Ceuta and Melilla and the Bocamina II plant in Chile.\n\nThis item was also a/ff.ligaected by the impairment loss on assets in Australia and Mexico.\n\n'Reclassi/fi.ligacations  from/to  assets  held  for  sale'  refer mainly  to  the  prope/r\\_t.ligay  and  other  assets  of  the  Italian companies Enel X Paytipper SpA, Paytipper Network Srl and CityPoste Payment SpA.\n\n'Other changes' include the provision for plant retirement and site restoration costs in the amount of \u20ac861 million, mainly in Spain and Italy, new leases of \u20ac723 million, impairment losses on the prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment of the Argentine companies operating in a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy in the amount of \u20ac576 million and the e/ff.ligaect of capitalizing interest on loans speci/fi.ligacally dedicated to capital expenditure on prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment of \u20ac182 million (\u20ac154 million in 2020).

In addition, the Group has no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop investment prop-\n\ne/r\\_t.ligay or for repairs, maintenance or enhancements.

The Open Innovability\u00ae ecosystem generates innovation through the creation  and  sharing  of  internal  and  external  solutions that give life to ideas that require appropriate forms of legal protection. Intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay plays a dual role: /fi.ligarst, it enables control over inventive solutions, technologies and knowledge generated by both the Group and the innovation ecosystems of which Enel is a pa/r\\_t.liga with the involvement of universities, research bodies, suppliers, programmers and consultants; second, intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay rights enable the safe and sustainable propagation of the technological solutions through which electri/fi.ligacation, platformization and stewardship programs are implemented. At December 31, 2021, the Group had applied for 892 patents in 146 technological families. Of these, 749 have been granted and 143 are pending. The po/r\\_t.ligafolio ensures protection in all the markets in which the Group is present. Enel's po/r\\_t.ligafolio also includes 15 utility models and 170 design registrations. Together with patents, utility models and designs, IP rights also include industrial secrets of both a technical and commercial nature which are constantly\n\ncodi/fi.ligaed and maintained in line with the provisions of the\n\nTrade Secrets Management procedure (see below). The Group also owns 1,576 trademarks, of which 1,455 have already been registered, with 121 applications pending. The  Enel  Green  Power  and  Thermal  Generation  Global Business Line is involved in the development of innovative technical solutions in solar generation that seek (i) to increase the photovoltaic output of plants by increasing charge transfer mechanisms at the micro and nanometric level in correspondence with di/ff.ligaerent layers both in single and heterojunction cells and in tandem systems and (ii) to create an innovative system for the rapid and automatable installation of photovoltaic panels on prefabricated suppo/r\\_t.liga structures, generating signi/fi.ligacant reductions in installation times while increasing in the precision and scalability of installation and, therefore, the Group's competitiveness at the international level. These solutions cover a total of 11 patent families currently comprising 28 national and international patent applications pending and 7 national patents granted.\n\nThe patent assets of Global Infrastructure and Networks contribute signi/fi.ligacantly to the strategy of creating plat-",

The Grid Blue Sky project, whose launch was announced last year, is contributing to the creation of a new global operating platform for the Group's grids. In consideration of the high intensity of IP generated, fu/r\\_t.ligaher analysis of the project was conducted, which is discussed in more detail later in this section.\n\nIn the Enel X Global Business Line, the development of solutions with an impact on IP assets essentially regarded applications in the telemedicine business and urban liveability platforms. The Sma/r\\_t.liga Axistance eWell app is an especially impo/r\\_t.ligaant example of the former, a health program designed and managed by specialists from the Policlinico Gemelli Foundation and delivered through a telemedicine platform and an app, both created by Enel X and protected by copyright. Urban liveability solutions include the 15 Minutes City Index, an urban planning indicator developed in collaboration with the University of Florence, for which Enel X is the holder of a trade secret and an Italian patent application. Using open data, the 15 Minutes City Index evaluates essential services (public transpo/r\\_t.liga, hospitals, schools, etc.), identifying underserved areas for each municipality and individual micro-district (with respect to population density), thereby suppo/r\\_t.ligaing urban planning. As regards the electric mobility business, the IP po/r\\_t.ligafolio comprises a diversi/fi.ligaed range of forms of protection, including patents for inventions, designs, trade secrets, utility models and copyrights with a technological content. Notable examples of these include: (i) the patent family for bidirectional high-power charging infrastructures, with applications\n\ninitially deposited in the United States and subsequently initiated at the international level; (ii) the trade secrets connected with strategic mobility platforms; (iii) the copyright on the Juice Pass app; (iv) the community design to protect the aesthetic form of Juice Media, an innovative product that enables the simultaneous o/ff.ligaer of electric charging and multimedia adve/r\\_t.ligaising services in a single structure; and (v) the Juice Pole Mini designs, which are protected in Europe, India, Chile, Norway, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Group is also using copyright and trade-secret protections for the innovative IP-dense solutions it is developing concerning climate models and advanced quantitative models for the analysis of energy systems in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation in the main geographical areas in which we operate, using an integrated and future-oriented vision.\n\nAt  an  organizational  and  communication  level,  during 2021, Enel followed up on two lines of actions intended at achieving strategic, responsible and sustainable management of its intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay. On the one hand, a new Intellectual Prope/r\\_t.ligay Management procedure was adopted at the Group level. On the other, in the wake of the survey of the Group's IP po/r\\_t.ligafolio in 2020, an intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay repo/r\\_t.ligaing project was continued, to be incorporated within the broader scope of the Enel Group's non-/fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas service concession arrangements that do not fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 and had a balance as at December 31, 2021.\n\n|                                                                                             | Millions of euro                    | Millions of euro          | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro              | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                                             | Grantor                             | Activity                  | Country            | Concession  period | Concession  period  remaining | Renewal  option    | at Dec. 31,  2021  | Initial fair  value |\n| Endesa Distribuci\u00f3n  El\u00e9ctrica                                                              | -                                   | Electricity  distribution | Spain              | Inde/fi.liganite   | Inde/fi.liganite              | -                  | 5,678              | 5,673               |\n| Codensa                                                                                     | Republic of  Colombia               | Electricity  distribution | Colombia           | Inde/fi.liganite   | Inde/fi.liganite              | -                  | 1,176              | 1,839               |\n| Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Chile  (formerly Chilectra)                                               | Republic of  Chile                  | Electricity  distribution | Chile              | Inde/fi.liganite   | Inde/fi.liganite              | -                  | 1,254              | 1,667               |\n| Enel Distribuci\u00f3n Per\u00fa  (formerly Empresa de  Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica de  Lima No/r\\_t.ligae) | Republic of  Peru                   | Electricity  distribution | Peru               | Inde/fi.liganite   | Inde/fi.liganite              | -                  | 525                | 548                 |\n| E-Distribu/uni0163ie Muntenia                                                               | Romanian  Ministry for the  Economy | Electricity  distribution | Romania            | 2005-2054          | 33 years                      | Yes                | 119                | 191                 |\n\nAssets with an inde/fi.liganite useful life amounted to \u20ac8,633 million (\u20ac8,892 million at December 31, 2020), essentially accounted for by concessions for distribution activities\n\nin Spain (\u20ac5,678 million), Colombia (\u20ac1,176 million), Chile (\u20ac1,254 million) and Peru (\u20ac525 million), for which there was no statutory or currently predictable expiration date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

More speci/fi.ligacally, two separate CGUs have been identi/fi.ligaed:\n\n- \u00b7 the  other  comprises  the  Non-Peninsular  Territories (Iberia NPT), for which the related cash /fl.ligaows are largely independent of those generated in the peninsular area, given the regulation of the related market.\n- \u00b7 one comprises mainland Iberia (Iberian Peninsula);\n\nTherefore, at December 31, 2021, the CGUs independently underwent impairment testing and an impairment loss of \u20ac1,488 million was recognized for plants in the Non-Peninsular Territories.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill recognized was estimated by calculating the value in use of the CGUs using discounted cash /fl.ligaow models, which involve estimating expected future cash /fl.ligaows and applying an appropriate discount rate, selected on the basis of market inputs such as risk-free rates, betas and market-risk premiums.\n\nCash /fl.ligaows were determined on the basis of the best information available at the time of the estimate, taking account of the speci/fi.ligac risks of each CGU, and drawn:\n\n- \u00b7 for  subsequent  years,  from  assumptions  concerning long-term developments in the main variables that determine cash /fl.ligaows, the average residual useful life of assets or the duration of the concessions.\n- \u00b7 for the explicit period, from the Business Plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent on November 22, 2021, containing forecasts for volumes, revenue, operating costs, capital expenditure, industrial and commercial organization and developments in the main macroeconomic variables (in/fl.ligaation, nominal interest rates and exchange rates) and commodity prices. The explicit period of cash /fl.ligaows considered in impairment testing was three years;\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the terminal value is calculated based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses related to the various CGUs subject to impairment testing:\n\n- \u00b7 annuity, for CGUs that are predominantly characterized by retail business, for which the residual life is, therefore, essentially correlated with the average duration of the customer relationships; as well as for businesses of conventional thermal power generation (Generation and Trading). This method is also used for the renewable energy (Enel Green Power) businesses to take account of: (i) the value resulting from the remaining useful lives of the plants; and (ii) the residual value, in the event of plant decommissioning, associated with licensing rights, the competitiveness of the production facilities (in terms of natural resources), and network interconnectivity.\n- \u00b7 perpetuity, for the businesses of large-hydro (LH) power generation and of distribution, in which the licenses and public concessions are of a long-term nature and are easily renewable; as well as for the Enel X businesses, as they feature the development of speci/fi.ligac know-how that is sustainable over the long term;\n\nThe nominal growth rate (g-rate) is equal to the long-term rate of growth in electricity and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business involved) and in any case no higher than the average long-term growth rate of the reference market.\n\nThe analysis of the impact of climate change on factors relevant to the business is a complex activity that requires the construction of a scenario framework and coherent analysis of the various dimensions involved. More information is available in the section at the end of this note entitled 'Analysis of energy transition scenarios and climate change impacts used in the valuation models'.\n\nThe Group con/fi.ligarmed its strategic direction based on the trends associated with the energy transition. The use of capital has been focused on decarbonization through the development  of  generation  assets  that  use  renewable sources, on the enabling infrastructures linked to the development of networks and on the implementation of platform models, making the most of technological and digital evolution, which will foster the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, as well as the development of new services for end users. Speci/fi.ligacally, in 2021 Enel's decarbonization roadmap was updated to capture the acceleration in the spread of renewables and the reduction in thermal generation capacity envisaged in the new 2022-2024 Strategic Plan and in the 2030 ambitions presented at the 2021 Capital Markets Day, se/t\\_t.ligaing the following objectives in line with the Paris Agreement:",

        "page_content": "## Analysis of energy transition scenarios and climate change impacts used in the valuation models\n\nAnalyzing the impact of climate change on factors relevant to our business is a complex endeavor that requires the construction of a scenario framework and consistent analyses along the various dimensions involved.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the transition scenarios describe the possible industrial and technological con/fi.ligagurations in speci/fi.ligac contexts of social, economic and policy evolution, corresponding to di/ff.ligaerent greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trends, while the physical scenarios describe the possible future trends in variables.\n\nIn 2021, Enel revised the medium- and long-term energy transition scenarios, within the overall framework ensuring their consistency with the climate scenario, and de/fi.liganed three alternative scenario narratives.\n\n- \u00b7 Slow Transition scenario - characterized by a slower energy transition that does not achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This scenario involves a slower increase in renewables and in the electri/fi.ligacation process that of the Paris scenario, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly over the sho/r\\_t.liga term (i.e., delays in implementation of the energy transition).\n- \u00b7 Paris scenario - calls for achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, so it is a level of climate ambition that is signi/fi.ligacantly higher than business as usual. The greater ambition is suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by greater electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption and a growing development of renewables.\n- \u00b7 Best Place scenario: designed to test assumptions that improve upon the Paris scenario. Here, too, the objectives of the Paris Agreement are achieved, but the scenario considers a wider range of technology options, such as a greater penetration of green hydrogen (i.e., produced using renewable energy) used more widely in hard-to-abate sectors, thereby facilitating the decarbonization process towards net zero emissions.\n\nAt Enel, we have selected the Paris scenario, which calls for achieving the Paris Agreement objectives, as the benchmark for long-term planning, unlike last year when the benchmark was the stated-policies scenario. We did this on the belief that the world's governments, businesses, organizations, and people will work together e/ff.ligaectively to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The increased commitment to net zero emissions in 2021 among nations that currently account for 88% of global emissions (25) and the success of COP26 suppo/r\\_t.liga the decision to select a scenario that achieves the Paris objectives as Enel's long-term benchmark. As for the possibility of assuming achievement of the more challenging Paris Agreement objective, i.e., to stabilize average global temperatures to within +1.5 \u00b0C, as a benchmark for long-term planning, there remain evident unce/r\\_t.ligaainties that a number of countries could remain on business-as-usual trajectories, thereby slowing the decarbonization process towards net zero emissions by 2050. Given this external environment, the Enel Group implements a business model that is in line with the highest ambition of the Paris Agreement and so is consistent with an increase in average global temperatures of 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100. Enel has set a long-term objective of reaching zero direct emissions (Scope 1) with fully renewable power generation and zero emissions connected with the retail sale of energy (Scope 3).\n\nThe assumptions for trends in commodities prices feeding the Paris scenario are consistent with the external scenarios that achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. More speci/fi.ligacally, we assume sustained growth in the price of CO 2 through 2030, caused by a gradual reduction in the supply of permits as demand increases, as well as stabilization in the price of coal due to declining demand. As for gas, we expect pricing pressures to lessen in the coming years as we see a realignment between global supply and demand. Finally, we are forecasting a gradual stabilization in oil prices, with demand expected to peak by around 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This level of detail therefore makes it possible to discriminate the speci/fi.ligac e/ff.ligaects that a change in temperature can have on energy requirements.\n\nSimilarly to the previous year, the speed of the energy transition has had a much greater impact on electricity demand than the increase in temperature as a result of climate change. Decarbonization policies, together with technological  innovation,  social  responsibility,  and  consequent changes in consumer behavior, will play an active role in trends in electricity demand and in the energy mix generally. However, analysis makes it clear that an increase in temperature as a result of climate change will lead to an increase in electricity demand, even if limited within a\n\nrange of one percentage point for both Italy and Spain. Considering the integrated view, the potential e/ff.ligaect of more ambitious transition scenarios has a more signi/fi.ligacant impact on electricity demand than the increase in temperature resulting from climate change.\n\nAlthough the trends in degree days (both HDD and CDD) (27) in the various climate scenarios are similar between the two  countries,  the  percentage  di/ff.ligaerences  in  electricity demand in Spain for the three scenarios are lower than in Italy. The essential di/ff.ligaerence concerns the energy system by 2030, for which Spain's existing national energy plan is already very ambitious and in line with RCP 2.6, meaning that the Slow Transition scenario is closer to the Paris scenario. Therefore, we expect less volatility in energy system trends and in electricity demand over the 2031-2050 period.\n\n## Italy - Average impact on electricity demand (2031-2050) of the three transition scenarios paired with RCP 2.6 and 4.5\n\nParis RCP 2.6 to Slow Transition RCP 4.5\n\nParis RCP 2.6 to Best Place RCP 2.6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The driving factor would be the greater demand for cooling expected in the country. This change is also con/fi.ligarmed using a system modeling approach. However, these forecasts are subject to a signi/fi.ligacant degree of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty given the volatility of Brazilian economic growth.\n\nArgentina could also experience an increase in demand linked to an increase in temperature, estimated at between 0.3% and 0.6% of prospective demand. Similarly to Brazil, this forecast depends largely on the impact of macroeco-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnomic developments in this country on electricity demand. The same considerations can also be extended to the other countries in which the Group is present. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in the rest of Latin America, where we again observe the positive elasticity of electricity demand to temperatures, the expected rise in temperature would still have less impact than economic growth. In fact, in Chile and Colombia, historical evidence still shows a strong coupling between the growth of electricity demand and GDP growth, with demand from the industrial sector accounting for around 50% of electricity consumption.

Under the provisions of specific agreements, its carrying amount can be adjusted to a lower amount resulting from the application of a price formula that governs the possible sale of the investment itself and which is subject to multiple conditions to be assessed based on di/ff.ligaerent scenarios' probability of occurrence. At December 31, 2020, the fair value calculated using that price formula (\u20ac104 million) was lower than the amount obtained using the equity method. In 2021, due to the recognition of a signi/fi.ligacant reduction in the OCI reserves relating to hedging derivatives (\u20ac687 million)\n\nand the recognition through pro/fi.ligat or loss of the pro/fi.ligat or loss (\u20ac555 million) for the period and previous years not previously recognized (due to the adjustments to the lower fair value), the carrying amount of the investment was reduced to zero. In addition, a provision for impairment losses on investments of \u20ac28 million was established.\n\nApa/r\\_t.liga from these developments, the change in equity-accounted investments is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends distributed in the period in the amount of \u20ac91 million, mainly by Rusenergosbyt and Tejo Energia Produ\u00e7\u00e3o e Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de Energia El\u00e9ctrica;",

In addition, the group has two other limited-enrollment plans (i) for current and  retired  Endesa  employees  covered  by  the  electricity  industry  collective  bargaining  agreement  prior to the changes introduced with the framework agreement noted earlier and (ii) for employees of the Catalan\n- companies merged in the past (Fecsa/Enher/HidroEmpord\u00e0). Both are de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans and bene/fi.ligats are fully ensured, with the exception of the former plan for bene/fi.ligats in the event of the death of a retired employee. Finally, the Brazilian companies have also established de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans;\n- \u00b7 the item 'Health insurance' refers to bene/fi.ligats for current or retired employees covering medical expenses;\n- \u00b7 the item 'Electricity discount' comprises bene/fi.ligats regarding electricity supply associated in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular with foreign companies;\n- \u00b7 'Other bene/fi.ligats' mainly regard the loyalty bonus, which is adopted in various countries and for Italy is represented by the estimated liability for the bene/fi.ligat entitling employees covered by the electricity workers national collective bargaining agreement to a bonus for achievement of seniority milestones (25th and 35th year of service). It also includes other incentive plans, which provide for the award to ce/r\\_t.ligaain Company managers of a monetary bonus subject to speci/fi.ligaed conditions.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas changes in the de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation for post-employment and other long-term employee bene/fi.ligats at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, as well as a reconciliation of that obligation with the actuarial liability.",

The time horizon envisaged, three years, corresponds to the period from the termination of power generation to the transfer of plant management to\n\nEnresa (so-called 'post-operational costs') and takes account, among the various assumptions used to estimate the amount, of the quantity of unused nuclear fuel expected at the date of closure of each of the Spanish nuclear plants on the basis of the provisions of the concession agreement.\n\n## Site retirement, removal and restoration provision\n\nThis provision represents the present value of the estimated cost for the retirement and removal of non-nuclear plants where there is a legal or constructive obligation to",

It includes an estimate of the potential liability relating to disputes that arose during the year, as well as revised estimates of the potential costs associated with disputes initiated in prior years. The balance for litigation mainly regards the companies in Spain (\u20ac181 million), Italy (\u20ac133 million) and Latin America (\u20ac497 million).\n\nThe increase compared with the previous year, equal to \u20ac14 million, mainly re/fl.ligaects the increase in the provision in Italy, Iberia and Brazil, re/fl.ligaecting provisions for new disputes, o/ff.ligaset by an increase in uses in Peru following the resolution of a number of disputes.\n\n## Provision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nThe provision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates covers costs in respect of sho/r\\_t.ligafalls in the environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates needed for compliance with national or supranational environmental protection requirements and mainly regards Enel Energ\u00eda and Endesa Energ\u00eda.\n\n## Provision for taxes and duties\n\nThe provision for taxes and duties covers the estimated liability deriving from tax disputes concerning direct and indirect taxes.\n\nThe balance of the provision also includes the provision for current and potential disputes concerning local prope/r\\_t.ligay tax (whether the Imposta Comunale sugli Immobili (ICI) or the Imposta Municipale Unica (IMU)) in Italy. In Italy, the Group has taken due account of developments in land registry regulations (which with e/ff.ligaect from January 1, 2016 excluded machinery, devices, equipment and other plant speci/fi.ligac to a production process from the calculation of the imputed rent for buildings classi/fi.ligaed in land\n\nregistry group D, which includes generation plants) in estimating the liability for such taxes, both for the purposes of quantifying the probable risk associated with pending litigation and generating a reasonable valuation of probable future charges on positions that have not yet been assessed by the Revenue Agency and municipalities.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions cover various risks and charges, mainly in connection with regulatory disputes and disputes with local authorities regarding various duties and fees or other charges.\n\nThe increase of \u20ac68 million in other provisions is, in addition to provisions for new insurance indemnities, mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Enel Global Trading for provisions recognized by the company in view of a possible adjustment of the gas contract price to the market price by the supplier.\n\n## Provision for early retirement incentives and other restructuring plans\n\nThe provision for early retirement incentives and other restructuring plans includes the estimated charges related to binding agreements for the voluntary termination of employment contracts in response to organizational needs. The reduction of \u20ac339 million for the year mainly re/fl.ligaects uses of provisions for incentives established in Spain ( Acuerdo de Salida Voluntaria ) and Italy in previous years to cover the early termination of employment for ce/r\\_t.ligaain employees.\n\n## Provision for restructuring programs connected with the energy transition\n\nEnel, in its role as a leader of the energy transition, has placed decarbonization and growth of renewables around the world at the center of its strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The consequent revision of processes and operating models will require changes in the roles and skills of employees, which the Group intends to implement with highly sustainable plans based on redeployment programs, with major upskilling and reskilling plans and voluntary individual early retirement agreements. The energy transition is also based on the progressive and expansive development of digital\n\ntools, as digitization is essential to responding to multiple external forces and making informed and well-considered decisions at every level within the Group.\n\nA provision was therefore established in 2020 for restructuring programs, which at December 31, 2021 amounted to \u20ac1,331 million, which is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Spain and Italy, and represents the estimated costs that the Group will incur following the acceleration of the energy transition, for all direct and indirect activities related to the review of processes and operating models and the roles and skills of employees.\n\n## 40.

For calculating ECL, the Group applies two di/ff.ligaerent approaches:\n\n- \u00b7 the general approach, for /fi.liganancial assets other than trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables. This approach, based on an assessment of any significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed comparing PD at origination with PD at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n- Then, based on the results of the assessment, a loss allowance is recognized based on 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL (i.e., staging):\n- -lifetime ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has\n- -12-month ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has not been a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition;\n\n| Millions of euro                                      | at Dec. 31, 2021   | at Dec. 31, 2021                              | at Dec. 31, 2021   | at Dec. 31, 2020   | at Dec. 31, 2020                              | at Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                       | Gross  amount      | Loss  allowance  for  expected  credit losses | Total              | Gross  amount      | Loss  allowance  for  expected  credit losses | Total              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                             | 8,759              | -                                             | 8,759              | 5,702              | -                                             | 5,702              |\n| Trade receivables                                     | 19,739             | 3,663                                         | 16,076             | 15,333             | 3,287                                         | 12,046             |\n| Loan assets                                           | 10,861             | 234                                           | 10,627             | 7,352              | 208                                           | 7, 14 4            |\n| Other /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost | 3,455              | 154                                           | 3,301              | 2, 170             | 129                                           | 2,041              |\n| Total                                                 | 42,814             | 4,051                                         | 38,763             | 30,557             | 3,624                                         | 26,933             |\n\nTo measure expected losses, the Group assesses trade receivables and contract assets with the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, both on an individual basis (e.g., government enti-\n\nties, authorities, /fi.liganancial counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies, wholesale sellers, traders and large companies, etc.) and a collective basis (e.g., retail customers).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- been a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk or which are credit impaired (i.e., defaulted based on past due information);\n- \u00b7 the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables with or without a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing component, based on lifetime ECL without tracking changes in credit risk.\n\nA forward-looking adjustment can be applied considering qualitative and quantitative information in order to re/fl.ligaect future  events  and  macroeconomic  developments  that could impact the risk associated with the po/r\\_t.ligafolio or /fi.liganancial instrument.\n\nDepending on the nature of the /fi.liganancial assets and the credit risk information available, the assessment of the increase in credit risk can be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed on:\n\n- \u00b7 a collective basis, if no reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information is available without undue cost or e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to measure expected credit losses on an individual instrument basis.\n- \u00b7 an individual basis, if the receivables are individually signi/fi.ligacant and for all receivables which have been individually identi/fi.ligaed for impairment based on reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information;\n\nWhen there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a\n\n/fi.liganancial asset in its entirety or a po/r\\_t.ligaion thereof, the gross carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset shall be reduced.

        "page_content": "## Long-term debt - Main covenants\n\nThe Group's main long-term /fi.liganancial liabilities are governed by covenants that are commonly adopted in international business practice. These liabilities primarily regard bond issues carried out within the framework of the Global/Euro Medium Term Notes program, issues of subordinated unconve/r\\_t.ligaible hybrid bonds (so-called 'hybrid bonds') and loans granted by banks and other /fi.liganancial institutions (including the European Investment Bank and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA).\n\nThe main covenants regarding bond issues carried out within the framework of the Global/Euro Medium Term Notes program of Enel and Enel Finance International NV (including the green bonds of Enel Finance International NV guaranteed by Enel SpA, which are used to /fi.liganance the Group's so-called 'eligible green projects') and those regarding bonds issued by Enel Finance International NV on the US market guaranteed by Enel SpA can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 pari passu clauses, under which the bonds and the associated security constitute a direct, unconditional and unsecured obligation of the issuer and the guarantor and are issued without preferential rights among them and have at least the same seniority as other present and future unsubordinated and unsecured bonds of the issuer and the guarantor;\n- \u00b7 negative pledge clauses under which the issuer and the guarantor may not establish or maintain mo/r\\_t.ligagages, liens or other encumbrances on all or pa/r\\_t.liga of its assets or revenue to secure ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial liabilities, unless the same encumbrances are extended equally or pro rata to the bonds in question;\n- \u00b7 cross-default clauses, under which the occurrence of a default event in respect of a speci/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability (above a threshold level) of the issuer, the guarantor or, in some cases, 'signi/fi.ligacant' subsidiaries, constitutes a default in respect of the liabilities in question, which become immediately repayable.\n\nSince 2019, Enel Finance International NV has issued a number of 'sustainable' bonds on the European market (as pa/r\\_t.liga of the Euro Medium Term Notes - EMTN bond issue program) and on the American market, both guaranteed by Enel SpA, linked to the achievement of a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations that contain the same covenants as other bonds of the same type.\n\nThe main covenants covering Enel's hybrid bonds, including the perpetual hybrid bond issues, which will only be repaid in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 subordination clauses, under which each hybrid bond is subordinate to all other bonds issued by the company and has the same seniority with all other hybrid /fi.liganancial instruments issued, being senior only to equity instruments;\n- \u00b7 prohibition on mergers with other companies, the sale or leasing of all or a substantial pa/r\\_t.liga of the company's assets to another company, unless the la/t\\_t.ligaer succeeds in all obligations of the issuer.\n\nThe  main  covenants  envisaged  in  the  loan  contracts of Enel and Enel Finance International NV and the other Group companies, including the sustainability-linked loan facility agreements obtained by Enel SpA, can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 disposals  clauses,  under  which  the  borrower  and,  in some cases, the guarantor may not dispose of their assets or operations, with the exception of expressly permi/t\\_t.ligaed disposals;\n- \u00b7 negative pledge clauses, under which the borrower and, in some cases, the guarantor are subject to limitations on the establishment of mo/r\\_t.ligagages, liens or other encumbrances on all or pa/r\\_t.liga of their respective assets, with the exception of expressly permi/t\\_t.ligaed encumbrances;\n- \u00b7 pari passu clauses, under which the payment unde/r\\_t.ligaakings of the borrower have the same seniority as its other unsecured and unsubordinated payment obligations;\n- \u00b7 rating clauses, which provide for the borrower or the guarantor to maintain their rating above a ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligaed level;\n- \u00b7 change of control clauses, under which the borrower and, in some cases, the guarantor could be required to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the /fi.liganancing or make compulsory early repayment of the loans granted;\n- \u00b7 cross-default clauses, under which the occurrence of a default event in respect of a speci/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability (above a threshold level) of the issuer or, in some cases, the guarantor constitutes a default in respect of the liabilities in question, which become immediately repayable.\n\nIn some cases, the covenants are also binding for the signi/fi.ligacant companies or subsidiaries of the obligated pa/r\\_t.ligaies. All the borrowings considered specify 'events of default' typical of international business practice, such as, for example, insolvency, bankruptcy proceedings or the entity ceasing trading.\n\nIn addition, the guarantees issued by Enel in the interest of e-distribuzione SpA for ce/r\\_t.ligaain loans to e-distribuzione SpA from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA require that at the end of each six-month measurement period Enel's net consolidated /fi.liganancial debt shall not exceed 4.5 times annual consolidated gross operating pro/fi.ligat.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk management\n\n## Financial risk management governance and objectives\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of its operations, the Enel Group is exposed to a variety of /fi.liganancial risks, notably interest rate risk, commodity risk, currency risk, credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Group's governance arrangements for /fi.liganancial risks include internal commi/t\\_t.ligaees and the establishment of speci/fi.ligac policies and operational limits. Enel's primary objective is to mitigate /fi.liganancial risks appropriately so that they do not give rise to unexpected changes in results.\n\nThe Group's policies for managing /fi.liganancial risks provide for the mitigation of the e/ff.ligaects on pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of changes in interest rates and exchange rates with the exclusion of translation risk (connected with consolidation of the accounts). This objective is achieved at the source of the risk, through the diversi/fi.ligacation of both the nature of the /fi.liganancial instruments and the sources of revenue, and by modifying the risk pro/fi.ligale of speci/fi.ligac exposures with derivatives entered into on over-the-counter markets or with speci/fi.ligac commercial agreements.\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of its governance of compliance risks, the Enel Group monitors non-risk-reducing positions in OTC derivatives contracts in relation to the threshold values established under the EMIR (Regulation (EU) no. 648/2012) for the various asset classes. In 2021, the Group was positioned below those clearing thresholds for all asset classes, maintaining its classi/fi.ligacation as a non-/fi.liganancial counterpa/r\\_t.ligay.\n\nThere were no changes in the sources of exposure to such risks compared with the previous year.\n\nFinally, the impact of COVID-19 on risk management is-\n\nsues was limited and in any case not such as to directly and materially in/fl.ligauence the valuation of derivative instruments and the outcome of the assessment of the e/ff.ligaectiveness of hedges of exchange rates, interest rates and commodities. The /fi.liganancial underlyings were not a/ff.ligaected by the adverse impact of COVID-19 either, and no changes were recorded\n\nin the exposures.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk derives primarily from the use of /fi.liganancial instruments and manifests itself as unexpected changes in charges on /fi.liganancial liabilities, if indexed to /fl.ligaoating rates and/or exposed to the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty of /fi.liganancial terms and conditions in negotiating new debt instruments, or as an unexpected change in the value of /fi.liganancial instruments measured at fair value (such as /fi.ligaxed-rate debt).\n\nThe  main  /fi.liganancial  liabilities  held  by  the  Group  include bonds, bank borrowings, borrowings from other lenders, commercial paper, derivatives, cash deposits received to secure  commercial  or  derivative  contracts  (guarantees, cash collateral).\n\nThe Enel Group mainly manages interest rate risk through the de/fi.liganition of an optimal /fi.liganancial structure, with the dual goal of stabilizing borrowing costs and containing the cost of funds.\n\nThis goal is pursued through the diversi/fi.ligacation of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial liabilities by contract type, maturity and interest rate, and modifying the risk pro/fi.ligale of speci/fi.ligac exposures using OTC derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate options. The term of such derivatives does not exceed the maturity of the underlying /fi.liganancial liability, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such contracts is o/ff.ligaset by a corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nProxy hedging techniques can be used in a number of residual circumstances, when the hedging instruments for the risk factors are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid.\n\nFor the purpose of EMIR compliance, in order to test the actual e/ff.ligaectiveness of the hedging techniques adopted, the Group subjects its hedge po/r\\_t.ligafolios to periodic statistical assessment.\n\nUsing interest rate swaps, the Enel Group agrees with the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay  to  periodically  exchange  /fl.ligaoating-rate  interest /fl.ligaows with /fi.ligaxed-rate /fl.ligaows, both calculated on the same notional principal amount.\n\nFloating-to-/fi.ligaxed  interest  rate  swaps  transform  /fl.ligaoating-rate /fi.liganancial liabilities into /fi.ligaxed rate liabilities, thereby neutralizing the exposure of cash /fl.ligaows to changes in interest rates.\n\nFixed-to-/fl.ligaoating interest rate swaps transform /fi.ligaxed rate /fi.liganancial liabilities into /fl.ligaoating-rate liabilities, thereby neutralizing the exposure of their fair value to changes in interest rates.\n\nFloating-to-/fl.ligaoating interest rate swaps transform the indexing criteria for /fl.ligaoating-rate /fi.liganancial liabilities.\n\nSome structured borrowings have multi-stage cash /fl.ligaows hedged by interest rate swaps that at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, and for a limited time, provide for the exchange of /fi.ligaxedrate interest /fl.ligaows.\n\nInterest rate options involve the exchange of interest differences calculated on a notional principal amount once ce/r\\_t.ligaain thresholds  (strike  prices)  are  reached.  These thresholds  specify  the  e/ff.ligaective  maximum  rate  (cap)  or the minimum rate (/fl.ligaoor) to which the synthetic /fi.liganancial instrument will be indexed as a result of the hedge. Ce/r\\_t.ligaain hedging strategies provide for the use of combinations of options (collars) that establish the minimum and maximum rates at the same time. In this case, the strike prices are normally set so that no premium is paid on the contract (zero cost collars).\n\nSuch contracts are normally used when the /fi.ligaxed interest rate that can be obtained in an interest rate swap is considered too high with respect to market expectations for future interest rate developments. In addition, interest rate\n\n<!-- image -->",

Enel also uses various types of derivatives, typically on the OTC market.\n\nThe derivatives in the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial instruments include cross currency interest rate swaps, currency forwards and currency swaps. The term of such contracts does not exceed the maturity of the underlying instrument, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such instruments o/ff.ligasets the corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps are used to transform a long-term /fi.liganancial liability denominated in a currency other than the presentation currency into an equivalent liability in the presentation currency.\n\nCurrency forwards are contracts in which the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies agree to exchange principal amounts denominated in di/ff.ligaerent currencies at a speci/fi.ligaed future date and\n\nexchange rate (the strike). Such contracts may call for the actual exchange of the two principal amounts (deliverable forwards) or payment of the di/ff.ligaerence generated by differences between the strike exchange rate and the prevailing exchange rate at maturity (non-deliverable forwards). In the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the strike rate and/or the spot rate can be determined as averages of the rates observed in a given period.\n\nCurrency swaps are contracts in which the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies enter into two transactions of the opposite sign at di/ff.ligaerent future dates (normally one spot, the other forward) that provide for the exchange of principal denominated in different currencies.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the notional amount of transactions outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, broken down by type of hedged item.\n\n| Millions of euro                                                                                       | Notional amount   | Notional amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                                        | at Dec. 31,  2021 | at Dec. 31,  2020 |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) hedging debt denominated in currencies other than the euro | 21,123            | 20,636            |\n| Currency forwards hedging currency risk on commodities                                                 | 6,183             | 5,469             |\n| Currency forwards/CCIRSs hedging future cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the euro             | 5,034             | 3,971             |\n| Other currency forwards                                                                                | 926               | 990               |\n| Total                                                                                                  | 33,266            | 31,066            |\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, these include:\n\n- \u00b7 currency forwards and cross currency swaps with a total notional amount of \u20ac11,217 million used to hedge the currency risk associated with purchases of natural gas and fuel and expected cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the euro (\u20ac9,440 million at December 31, 2020);\n- \u00b7 CCIRSs with a notional amount of \u20ac21,123 million to hedge the currency risk on debt denominated in currencies other than the euro (\u20ac20,636 million at December 31, 2020);\n- \u00b7 other currency forwards, which include OTC derivatives transactions carried out to mitigate currency risk on expected cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the presentation currency connected with the purchase of investment goods in the renewables and infrastructure and networks sectors (new generation digital meters), on operating costs for the supply of cloud services and on revenue from the sale of renewable energy.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, 45% (51% at December 31, 2020) of Group long-term debt was denominated in currencies other than the euro.\n\nTaking account of hedges of currency risk, the percentage of debt not hedged against that risk amounted to 17% at December 31, 2021 (17% at December 31, 2020).\n\nCurrency risk sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group analyzes the sensitivity of its exposure by estimating the e/ff.ligaects of a change in exchange rates on the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial instruments.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss and equity of market scenarios that would cause a change in the fair value of derivatives or in the /fi.liganancial expense associated with unhedged gross medium/long-term debt.\n\nThese scenarios are obtained by simulating the appreciation/depreciation of the euro against all of the currencies\n\ncompared with the value observed as at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date. There were no changes in the methods or assumptions used in the sensitivity analysis compared with the previous\n\nyear.\n\nWith all other variables held constant, the pre-tax pro/fi.ligat would be a/ff.ligaected by changes in exchange rates as follows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  exposures  on  indexed  contracts  are  quanti/fi.ligaed  by breaking down the contracts that generate exposure into\n\nthe underlying risk factors.\n\nTo contain the e/ff.ligaects of /fl.ligauctuations and stabilize margins, in accordance with the policies and operating limits determined by the Group's governance and leaving an appropriate margin of /fl.ligaexibility to seize any sho/r\\_t.liga-term oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities that may present themselves, Enel develops and plans strategies that impact the various phases of the industrial process linked to the production and sale of electricity and gas (such as forward procurement and long-term commercial agreements), as well as risk mitigation plans and techniques using derivative contracts (hedging).\n\nAs regards electricity sold by the Group, Enel mainly uses /fi.ligaxed-price contracts in the form of bilateral physical contracts (PPAs) and /fi.liganancial contracts (e.g., contracts for differences, VPP contracts, etc.) in which di/ff.ligaerences are paid to the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay if the market electricity price exceeds the strike price and to Enel in the opposite case. The residual exposure in respect of the sale of energy on the spot\n\nmarket not hedged with such contracts is aggregated by uniform risk factors that can be managed with hedging transactions  on  the  market.  Proxy  hedging  techniques can be used for the industrial po/r\\_t.ligafolios when the hedging instruments for the speci/fi.ligac risk factors generating the exposure are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid. In addition, Enel uses po/r\\_t.ligafolio hedging techniques to assess oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for ne/t\\_t.ligaing intercompany exposures.\n\nThe Group mainly uses plain vanilla derivatives for hedging (more speci/fi.ligacally, forwards, swaps, options on commodities, futures, contracts for di/ff.ligaerences).\n\nSome of these products can be indexed to a variety of underlyings (coal, gas, oil, CO 2 , di/ff.ligaerent geographical areas, etc.) and the approaches can be assessed and adapted to speci/fi.ligac needs.\n\nEnel also engages in proprietary trading in order to maintain  a  presence  in  the  Group's  reference  energy  commodity  markets.  These  operations  consist  in  taking  on exposures in energy commodities (oil products, gas, coal, CO 2 ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and electricity) using /fi.liganancial derivatives and physical contracts traded on regulated and over-thecounter markets, optimizing pro/fi.ligats through transactions carried out on the basis of expected market developments.

Monitoring the consolidated exposure is carried out by Enel SpA.\n\nIn addition, at the Group level the policy provides for the use of uniform criteria - in all the main regions/countries/Global Business Lines and at the consolidated level - in measuring commercial credit exposures in order to promptly identify any deterioration in the quality of outstanding receivables and any mitigation actions to be taken.\n\nThe policy for managing credit risk associated with commercial activities provides for a preliminary assessment of the creditwo/r\\_t.ligahiness of counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies and the adoption of mitigation instruments, such as obtaining collateral or unsecured guarantees.\n\nIn addition, the Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes transactions to factor receivables without recourse, which results in the complete derecognition of the corresponding assets involved in the factoring, as the risks and rewards associated with them have been transferred.\n\nFinally, with regard to /fi.liganancial and commodity transactions, risk mitigation is pursued with a uniform system for assessing counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies at the Group level, including implementation at the level of regions/countries/Global Business Lines, as well as with the adoption of speci/fi.ligac standardized contractual frameworks that contain risk mitigation clauses (e.g., ne/t\\_t.ligaing arrangements) and possibly the exchange of cash collateral.\n\nDespite the deterioration in the collection status of some customer segments, which was taken into account in the assessment of the impairment of trade receivables, to date the Group po/r\\_t.ligafolio has displayed resilience to the global pandemic. This re/fl.ligaects the strengthening of digital collection channels and a sound diversi/fi.ligacation of commercial customers with a low exposure to the impacts of COVID (e.g., utilities and distribution companies).\n\n## Loan assets\n\n| Millions of euro       | Millions of euro                                           | Millions of euro            | Millions of euro       | Millions of euro                | Millions of euro   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                        |                                                            |                             |                        |                                 | at Dec. 31, 2021   |\n| Staging                | Basis for  recognition of  expected credit loss  allowance | Average loss rate  (PD*LGD) | Gross carrying  amount | Expected credit loss  allowance | Carrying   amount  |\n| Pe/r\\_f.ligaorming      | 12 m ECL                                                   | 0.6%                        | 10,585                 | 65                              | 10,520             |\n| Underpe/r\\_f.ligaorming | Lifetime ECL                                               | 27. 8 %                     | 72                     | 20                              | 52                 |\n| Non-pe/r\\_f.ligaorming  | Lifetime ECL                                               | 73.0%                       | 204                    | 149                             | 55                 |\n| Total                  |                                                            |                             | 10,861                 | 234                             | 10,627             |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amounts denominated in currencies other than the euro are translated at the o/ffi.ligacial closing exchange rates provided by the World Markets Re/fi.liganitiv (WMR) Company.\n\n| Millions of euro                   | Non-current       | Non-current       | Non-current       | Non-current       | Current           | Current           | Current           | Current           |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                    | Notional          | Notional          | Fair value        | Fair value        | Notional          | Notional          | Fair value        | Fair value        |\n|                                    | at Dec. 31,  2021 | at Dec. 31,  2020 | at Dec. 31,  2021 | at Dec. 31,  2020 | at Dec. 31,  2021 | at Dec. 31,  2020 | at Dec. 31,  2021 | at Dec. 31,  2020 |\n| DERIVATIVE ASSETS                  |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Fair value hedge derivatives:      |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                | 139               | 138               | 19                | 22                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                | 672               | 639               | 42                | 28                | -                 | 79                | -                 | 28                |\n| Total                              | 811               | 777               | 61                | 50                | -                 | 79                | -                 | 28                |\n| Cash /fl.ligaow hedge derivatives: |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                | 404               | 161               | 19                | 21                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                | 14,980            | 5,061             | 1,356             | 685               | 2,690             | 698               | 104               | 51                |\n| - on commodities                   | 2,693             | 2,541             | 1,059             | 428               | 3,469             | 2,165             | 3,023             | 627               |\n| Total                              | 18,077            | 7,763             | 2,434             | 1,134             | 6,159             | 2,863             | 3,127             | 678               |\n| Trading derivatives:               |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                | -                 | 50                | -                 | 2                 | 50                | -                 | 1                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                | 26                | 71                | -                 | 4                 | 2,154             | 3,430             | 23                | 79                |\n| - on commodities                   | 1,147             | 379               | 277               | 46                | 48,304            | 21,424            | 19,640            | 2,686             |\n| Total                              | 1,173             | 500               | 277               | 52                | 50,508            | 24,854            | 19,664            | 2,765             |\n| TOTAL DERIVATIVE ASSETS            | 20,061            | 9,040             | 2,772             | 1,236             | 56,667            | 27,796            | 22,791            | 3,471             |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nHedge accounting is applied to derivatives entered into in order to reduce risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk and net investments in foreign operations when all the criteria provided by IFRS 9 are met.\n\nAt  the  inception  of  the  transaction,  the  Group  documents  the  relationship  between  hedging  instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether hedging instruments are highly e/ff.ligaective in o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing changes in fair values or cash /fl.ligaows of hedged items.\n\nFor cash /fl.ligaow hedges of forecast transactions designated as hedged items, the Group assesses and documents that they are highly probable and present an exposure to changes in cash /fl.ligaows that a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nDepending on the nature of the risk exposure, the Group designates derivatives as either:\n\n- \u00b7 cash /fl.ligaow hedges.\n- \u00b7 fair value hedges;\n\nFor more details about the nature and the extent of risks arising from /fi.liganancial instruments to which the Group is\n\nexposed, please see note 47 'Risk management'.\n\nTo be e/ff.ligaective a hedge relationship shall meet all of the\n\nfollowing criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 the e/ff.ligaect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes resulting from the economic relationship;\n- \u00b7 existence of an economic relationship between hedging instrument and hedged item;\n- \u00b7 the hedge ratio de/fi.liganed at initial designation shall be equal to the one used for risk management purposes (i.e., same quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge the quantity of the hedged item).\n\nBased on the IFRS 9 requirements, the existence of an economic relationship is evaluated by the Group through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 on the other hand, if the underlying risk of the hedging instrument and the hedged item is not the same, the existence of the economic relationship will be demonstrated through a quantitative method in addition to a qualitative analysis of the nature of the economic relationship (i.e., linear regression).\n- \u00b7 if the underlying risk of the hedging instrument and the hedged item is the same, the existence of an economic relationship will be provided through a qualitative analysis;\n\nIn order to demonstrate that the behavior of the hedging instrument is in line with those of the hedged item, di/ff.ligaerent scenarios will be analyzed.",

This method compares changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hypothetical derivative between the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date and the inception date.\n- \u00b7 if the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument match and there are no other sources of ine/ff.ligaectiveness included the credit risk adjustment on the hedging derivative, the hedge relationship will be considered fully e/ff.ligaective on the basis of a qualitative assessment;\n\nThe main causes of hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can be the following:\n\n- \u00b7 timing di/ff.ligaerences (i.e., the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are se/t\\_t.ligaled at di/ff.ligaerent dates);\n- \u00b7 basis di/ff.ligaerences (i.e., the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged item depend on a variable that is di/ff.ligaerent from the variable that causes the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedging instrument to change);\n- \u00b7 quantity  or  notional  amount  di/ff.ligaerences  (i.e.,  the hedged item and hedging instrument are based on di/ff.ligaerent quantities or notional amounts);\n- \u00b7 credit risk (i.e., the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay credit risk di/ff.ligaerently impacts the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items).\n- \u00b7 other risks (i.e., changes in the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of a derivative hedging instrument or hedged item relate to risks other than the speci/fi.ligac risk being hedged);\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect the Group against exposures to changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities\n\nor /fi.ligarm commitment a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk that could a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the hedged risk.\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method is used is amo/r\\_t.ligaized to pro/fi.ligat or loss over the period to maturity.\n\n## Cash /fl.ligaow hedges\n\nCash /fl.ligaow hedges are applied in order to hedge the Group exposure to changes in future cash /fl.ligaows that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable transaction that could a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash /fl.ligaow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ine/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion is recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassi/fi.ligaed to pro/fi.ligat or loss in the periods when the hedged item a/ff.ligaects pro/fi.ligat or loss (for example, when the hedged forecast sale takes place).\n\nIf the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-/fi.liganancial asset (i.e., prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment or inventories, etc.) or a non-/fi.liganancial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction for a non-/fi.liganancial asset or a non-/fi.liganancial liability becomes a /fi.ligarm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, the amount accumulated in equity (i.e., hedging reserve) shall be removed and included in the initial amount (cost or other carrying amount) of the asset or the liability hedged (i.e., 'basis adjustment').\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a\n\nhedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was repo/r\\_t.ligaed in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. For hedge relationships using forwards as a hedging instrument, where only the change in the value of the spot element is designated as the hedging instrument, accounting for the forward element (pro/fi.ligat or loss vs. OCI) is de/fi.liganed case by case. This approach is actually applied by the Group for hedging of currency risk on renewables assets.\n\nConversely, for hedge relationships using cross currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments, the Group\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the roll-over date, the hedge relationship is not discontinued. Accordingly, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from that date, changes in the e/ff.ligaective fair value of the new derivative will be recognized in equity (the hedging reserve), while changes in the fair value of the old derivative are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Reform of benchmarks for the determination of interest rates - IBOR reform\n\n## Overview\n\nInterbank O/ff.ligaered Rates ('IBORs') are benchmark rates at which banks can borrow funds on the interbank market on an unsecured basis for a given period ranging from overnight to 12 months, in a speci/fi.ligac currency.\n\nIn recent years there have been a number of cases of manipulation of these rates by the banks contributing to their calculation. For this reason, regulators around the  world  have  begun  a  sweeping  reform  of  interest rate benchmarks that includes the replacement of some benchmarks with alternative risk-free rates (the IBOR reform).\n\nThe Group's main exposure is based on Euribor, USD LIBOR and GBP LIBOR.\n\nEuribor is still considered compliant with the European Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) and this permits market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants to continue to use it for both existing and new contracts.\n\nIn line with the most recent guidance issued by the major regulatory bodies:\n\n- \u00b7 the  1-month,  3-month  and  6-month  USD  LIBOR benchmarks will become unrepresentative after June 30, 2023 and the alternative reference rate will be the\n- Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR);\n- \u00b7 the  1-month,  3-month  and  6-month  GBP  LIBOR benchmarks will become unrepresentative after December 31, 2021 and the alternative reference rate will be the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).\n\nAs a result of the IBOR reform, a number of temporary exceptions to the rules on hedge relationships have been allowed in implementation of the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1) and August 2020 (Phase 2) to address, respectively:\n\n- \u00b7 post-replacement issues that could impact /fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing when an existing interest rate benchmark is reformed or replaced and there is there no longer any initial unce/r\\_t.ligaainty, but hedge contracts and relationships still need to be updated to re/fl.ligaect the new benchmark rates (Phase 2).\n- \u00b7 pre-replacement issues that impact /fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing in the period preceding the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative risk-free rate (Phase 1); and\n\n## Impact of the IBOR reform on the Group\n\nIn a context of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty regarding the IBOR transition in the various countries, the Group has determined the overall number and nominal value of the contracts impacted by the reform. In addition, a number of contractual amendments have already been implemented in contracts previously indexed to GBP LIBOR and others will be amended in 2022-2023 on the basis of the evolution of the IBOR reform and best market practice.\n\n## Debt and derivatives\n\nThe Group's /fl.ligaoating rate debt is mainly benchmarked against  Euribor  and  USD  LIBOR  and  is  almost  entirely hedged using /fi.liganancial derivatives.\n\nAt the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, the Group is planning to take no action with regard to Euribor since, as stated above, this benchmark has been comprehensively reformed to comply with the European Benchmarks Regulation. Despite the  continuity  with  Euribor,  replacement  clauses  may be required and could therefore be implemented by the Group in the new contracts in accordance with the evolution of accepted market practice.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group obtained new US dollar loans indexed  to  SOFR  and  proactively  changed  its  existing exposure in derivatives by switching from GPB LIBOR to SONIA. The main focus over the coming months will be how to change existing USD LIBOR to USD SOFR exposures and how to use the new, alternative risk-free rates for new /fi.liganancial transactions.\n\nThe Group's derivative instruments are managed through contracts that are mainly based on framework agreements de/fi.liganed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).",

        "page_content": "The ISDA has revised its standardized contracts in light of the IBOR reform and amended the choices for /fl.ligaoating rates within the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions to include replacement clauses that would apply upon the permanent discontinuation of speci/fi.ligac key benchmarks. These changes took e/ff.ligaect on January 25, 2021. Transactions represented in the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions carried out on January 25, 2021 or later include adjusted /fl.ligaoating-rate options (e.g., the choice of /fl.ligaoating rate with replacement clause), while transactions completed before that date (previous derivative contracts) continue to be based on the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions.\n\nFor this reason, the ISDA published an IBOR Fallback Protocol to facilitate multilateral amendments to include the amended de/fi.liganitions.\n\nThe Group is assessing whether to: (i) adopt that protocol in the light of its exposure and developments in the IBOR reform or (ii) adjust in advance any contracts impacted bilaterally by the reform.\n\n## Hedge relationships\n\nAt the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, hedged items and hedging instruments are primarily indexed to Euribor, USD LIBOR and GBP SONIA.\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty engendered by the IBOR reform on hedge relationships at December 31, 2021 with reference to both hedging instruments and hedged items. Both the hedged items and the hedging instruments will change their parameterization from interbank market-based benchmarks (IBORs) to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs) as a result of the contractual amendments that will take e/ff.ligaect in the coming years. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, unce/r\\_t.ligaainty remains as to how the replacement will take place with regard to both hedging instruments and hedged items indexed to USD LIBOR. The Group manages the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty associated with these hedge relationships by continuing to apply the temporary exceptions provided for in the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1). It was therefore felt that the benchmark indices for determining the interest rates on which the cash /fl.ligaows\n\nof the hedged items or the hedging instruments are based would not change as a consequence of the IBOR reform. The exception was applied for the following hedge relationship requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 establish  whether  the  future  hedged  cash  /fl.ligaows  will arise in a discontinued cash /fl.ligaow hedge relationship;\n- \u00b7 determine if a forecast transaction is highly probable;\n- \u00b7 assess the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedge relationships impacted may become ine/ff.ligaective a/t\\_t.ligaributable to di/ff.ligaerent replacements of existing benchmarks with alternative risk-free benchmarks. In any case, the Group will seek to implement the replacements at the same time.\n\nIn addition, the Group changed the reference to GBP LIBOR in its interest rate hedging instruments used in cash /fl.ligaow hedge relationships with the new, economically equivalent, SONIA benchmark at the end of 2021. There is therefore no longer any unce/r\\_t.ligaainty as to how and when the replacement can take place both with reference to the hedged items  and  the  hedging  instruments.  Consequently,  the Group no longer applies the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1) to these hedge relationships and, consequently, has begun to apply the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in August 2020 (Phase 2), modifying the formal designation of the hedge relationship as required by the IBOR reform and without considering this event as a termination of the hedge relationship.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, for cash /fl.ligaow hedge relationships, in modifying the description of the hedged item in the hedge relationship, the amounts accumulated in the hedging reserve were considered on the basis of the alternative benchmark index in relation to which the future hedged cash /fl.ligaows are determined.\n\nThe following table provides details of the notional amounts of the hedging instruments for which the amendments to IFRS 9 (both Phase 1 and Phase 2) were applied as at December 31, 2021, broken down by the alternative benchmark index used for determining the interest rate.\n\n| Millions of euro        | Notional amount at Dec. 31, 2021   | Notional amount at Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Hedging instruments (1) | Phase 1                            | Phase 2                            |\n| USD LIBOR/SOFR          | 1,315                              | -                                  |\n| GBP LIBOR/SONIA         | -                                  | 1,309                              |\n| Total                   | 1,315                              | 1,309                              |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cross currency interest rate swaps with a total amount of \u20ac859 million expired, while new derivatives amounted to \u20ac6,470 million, of which \u20ac3,532 million in respect of bond issues denominated in US dollars in July 2021. In addition, following the early redemption of conventional bonds in US dollars by Enel Finance International during the year, cross currency interest rate swaps of \u20ac5,909 million were terminated early. The amount also re/fl.ligaects developments in the exchange rate of the euro against the main other currencies and the e/ff.ligaect of amo/r\\_t.ligaization, which caused their notional amount to increase by \u20ac750 million.\n\n31, 2021 amounted to \u20ac6,019 million (\u20ac5,566 million at December 31, 2020), an increase of \u20ac453 million. The exposure to currency risk, especially that associated with the US dollar, is mainly due to purchases of natural gas, purchases of fuel and cash /fl.ligaows in respect of investments.

In addition to commodity risk, the Group companies are also exposed to changes in volumes associated with weather conditions (for example, temperature impacts the consumption of gas and power).\n\n- \u00b7 Level 3, where the fair value is determined on the basis of unobservable inputs.\n\nThis  note  also  provides  detailed  disclosures  concerning the valuation techniques and inputs used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm these measurements.\n\nTo that end:\n\n- \u00b7 non-recurring  fair  value  measurements  are  those  required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRSs in the statement of /fi.liganancial position in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular circumstances.\n- \u00b7 recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRSs in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at the close of each period;\n\nFor general information or speci/fi.ligac disclosures on the accounting  treatment  of  these  circumstances,  please  see note 2 'Accounting policies'.\n\n## 50.1 Assets measured at fair value in the statement of /fi.liganancial position\n\nThe following table shows, for each class of assets measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis in the statement of /fi.liganancial position, the fair value measurement at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period and the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements of those assets are classi/fi.ligaed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This incentive - determined, at the time of the award, as a base value calculated in relation to the /fi.ligaxed remuneration of the individual bene/fi.ligaciary - may vary depending\n\nof /fi.liganancial instrument and market data at the close of the year, including the credit spreads of Enel.\n\non the degree of achievement of each of the three-year pe/r\\_f.ligaormance targets of the Plans, ranging from zero up to a maximum of 280% or 180% of the base value in the case, respectively, of the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer/General Manager or the other bene/fi.ligaciaries.\n\nThe Plans establish that, of the total incentive e/ff.ligaectively vested, the bonus will be fully paid in shares in the amount of (i) up to 100% of the base value for the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer/General Manager and (ii) up to 50% of the base value for the other bene/fi.ligaciaries.\n\nThe actual award of the bonus under the Plans is subject to the achievement of speci/fi.ligac pe/r\\_f.ligaormance targets during the three year pe/r\\_f.ligaormance period. If these targets are achieved, 30% of both the equity and cash components of the incentive will be paid in the /fi.ligarst year following the end of the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance period and the remaining 70% will be paid in the second year following the end of the performance period. The payment of a substantial po/r\\_t.ligaion of long-term variable remuneration (70% of the total) is therefore deferred to the second year following the end of the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance period of the individual Plans.\n\nThe following table provides information on the 2019 LTI Plan, the 2020 LTI Plan and the 2021 LTI Plan.\n\nFor more information on the characteristics of the Plans, please see the information documents prepared pursuant",

Nonetheless, to date the pro/fi.ligatability and /fi.liganancial position now achieved by Open Fiber makes it highly unlikely that the guarantee will be called in.\n\n## 55. Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nThe following repo/r\\_t.ligas the main contingent assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021, which are not recognized in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as they do not meet the requirements provided for in IAS 37.\n\n## Brindisi Sud thermal generation plant - Ash dispute - Italy\n\nWith regard to the criminal investigation initiated by the Public Prosecutor's O/ffi.ligace of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Lecce in 2017 concerning the use of /fl.ligay ash in the cement industry, the Brindisi Sud power plant was involved in a criminal investigation that resulted in the issue of a preventive seizure order that allowed operation of the plant subject to certain technical requirements. The order also provided for the seizure of Enel Produzione assets and receivables in an amount of about \u20ac523 million. On August 1, 2018, the Lecce Public Prosecutor lifted its seizure of the plant, with the consequent termination of the judicial custody/administration of the facility and the restitution of the other seized assets to Enel Produzione. The lifting of the seizure order was granted as a result of the fact that during the investigation the independent expe/r\\_t.ligas appointed by the investigating magistrate at the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Lecce issued a repo/r\\_t.liga, /fi.ligaled /fi.ligarst in preliminary form on July 16, 2018 and de/fi.liganitively on October 10, 2018, that con/fi.ligarmed the non-hazardous nature of the ash, /fi.liganding it suitable for use in the cement-making process, as well as the appropriateness of the operation of the plant. Although the seizure was lifted, the preliminary investigation continued both against the accused individuals and the company pursuant to Legislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001. Following the hearing of January 22, 2019, ordered by the investigating magistrate at the request of the Public Prosecutor to receive testimony from the expe/r\\_t.ligas on their repo/r\\_t.liga, the expe/r\\_t.ligas reiterated the non-hazardous nature of the ash produced by the plant and the possibility of their use in the production of cement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The pre-trial hearing judge remanded all of the defendants before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi at the hearing of December 9, 2021.\n\n## Brindisi Sud thermal generation plant Criminal proceedings against Enel employees - Italy\n\nAgain with regard to the Brindisi Sud thermal generation plant, a criminal proceeding was held before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi. A number of employees of Enel Produzione - cited as a liable pa/r\\_t.ligay in civil litigation - have been accused of causing criminal damage and dumping of hazardous substances with regard to the alleged contamination of land adjacent to the plant with coal dust as a result of actions between 1999 and 2011. At the end of 2013, the accusations were extended to cover 2012 and 2013. As pa/r\\_t.liga of the proceeding, injured pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including the Province and City of Brindisi, have submi/t\\_t.ligaed claims for total damages of about \u20ac1.4 billion. In its decision of October 26, 2016, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi: (i) acqui/t\\_t.ligaed nine of the thi/r\\_t.ligaeen defendants for not having commi/t\\_t.ligaed the o/ff.ligaense; (ii) ruled that it did not have to proceed for two of the defendants as the o/ff.ligaense was timebarred; and (iii) convicted the remaining two defendants, sentencing them with all the allowances provided for by law to nine months' imprisonment. With regard to payment of damages, the Cou/r\\_t.liga's ruling also: (i) denied all claims of public pa/r\\_t.ligaies and associations acting in the criminal proceeding to recover damages; and (ii) granted most of the claims /fi.ligaled by the private pa/r\\_t.ligaies acting to recover damages, referring the la/t\\_t.ligaer to the civil cou/r\\_t.ligas for quanti/fi.ligacation without granting a provisional award. The convicted employees and the civilly liable defendant, Enel Produzione, as well as one of the employees for whom the expiry of period of limitations had been declared, appealed the conviction. On February 8, 2019, the Lecce Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal: (i) con/fi.ligarmed the trial cou/r\\_t.liga ruling regarding the criminal convictions of two Enel Produzione executives; (ii) denied the claims for damages of some private appellants; (iii) granted some claims for damages, which had been denied in the trial cou/r\\_t.liga, referring the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, like the others - whose claims had been granted by the trial cou/r\\_t.liga - to the civil cou/r\\_t.ligas for quanti/fi.ligacation, without granting a provisional award; (iv) con/fi.ligarmed for the rest the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi except for extending litigation costs to the Province of Brindisi, which had not been awarded damages at either the trial cou/r\\_t.liga or on appeal.\n\nWith  a  subsequent  ruling,  the  Cou/r\\_t.liga  of  Appeal  of  Lecce granted the appeal lodged by the Province of Brindisi\n\nagainst the ruling, acknowledging that a material error had been made and therefore recognizing the generic entitlement of the Province to damages. The defendants /fi.ligaled an appeal against ruling with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation. Following the hearing of October 1, 2020, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation ove/r\\_t.ligaurned the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Lecce, with referral to another section of the same cou/r\\_t.liga for a new proceeding. The new proceeding was held before the mixed criminal section of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Lecce, which, at the hearing of November 10, 2021, acqui/t\\_t.ligaed the defendants for not having commi/t\\_t.ligaed the o/ff.ligaense and consequently revoked the civil rulings.\n\nIn addition to the proceeding above, two criminal proceedings are also under way before the Cou/r\\_t.ligas of Reggio Calabria and Vibo Valentia against a number of employees of Enel Produzione for the o/ff.ligaense of illegal waste disposal in connection with alleged violations concerning the disposal of waste from the Brindisi plant. Enel Produzione was not named a liable pa/r\\_t.ligay for civil damages in these proceedings. Both of the aforementioned trials were resolved positively for the employees of Enel Produzione: as regards the proceedings before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Vibo Valentia, at the hearing of June 17, 2021, the Cou/r\\_t.liga read out the operative po/r\\_t.ligaion of the ruling, declaring that it should not proceed against the defendants as the o/ff.ligaences with which they were charged were time-barred under the statute of limitations, also denying the aggravating circumstance referred to in A/r\\_t.ligaicle 434, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The criminal proceedings before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Reggio Calabria had ended previously at the hearing of June 23, 2016. The cou/r\\_t.liga acqui/t\\_t.ligaed the defendants because it found that no crime had been commi/t\\_t.ligaed for nearly all the most serious charges and for expiration of the statute of limitations for one serious charge and for all of the remaining charges involving minor o/ff.ligaenses.\n\n## Enel, Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale antitrust proceeding - Italy\n\nOn May 11, 2017, the Competition Authority announced the beginning of proceedings for alleged abuse of a dominant position against Enel SpA (Enel), Enel Energia SpA (EE) and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale SpA (SEN), with the concomitant pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of inspections. The proceeding was initiated on the basis of complaints /fi.ligaled by the Italian Association of Energy Wholesalers and Traders (AIGET) and the company Green Network SpA (GN), as well as a number of complaints from individual consumers.\n\nOn December 20, 2018 the Competition Authority issued its /fi.liganal ruling, with which it levied a /fi.ligane on Enel SpA, SEN and EE of \u20ac93,084,790.50, for abuse of a dominant position in violation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).",

The decision of that cou/r\\_t.liga, /fi.ligaled on October 17, 2019, pa/r\\_t.ligaially upheld the appeals /fi.ligaled by SEN and EE, declaring that the abusive conduct had been engaged in for a period of 1 year and 9 months, rather than the original period of 5 years and 5 months, and requiring the Authority to recalculate the penalty in accordance with the criteria speci/fi.ligaed in the ruling. With the same ruling, the Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga denied Enel's appeal - which challenged the joint and several liability of the Parent with SEN and EE. The ruling had no autonomous /fi.liganancial impact on the Competition Authority's obligation to recalculate the penalty. With a measure dated November 27, 2019, the Competition Authority set the recalculated penalty at \u20ac27,529,786.46.\n\nThe  rulings  of  the  Regional  Administrative  Cou/r\\_t.liga  were challenged on appeal before the Council of State by the three Enel Group companies and a precautionary request was presented at the same time asking for the suspension of the measure for recalculating the penalty levied by the Competition Authority. With an order of July 20, 2020, the Council of State, after the joinder of the three appeals, suspended the ruling and ordered that the issue be submi/t\\_t.ligaed for a preliminary ruling before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 267 of the TFEU, formulating a number of questions aimed at clarifying the interpretation of the concept of 'abuse of a dominant position' to be applied to the present case. On September 11 and 18, 2020, the CJEU noti/fi.ligaed EE and SEN and Enel, respectively, of the initiation of a proceeding pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 267 of the TFEU. The companies then /fi.ligaled briefs and, subsequently, EE and SEN pa/r\\_t.ligaicipated at a hearing on September 9, 2021. At the following hearing of December 9, 2021, the conclusions of the Advocate General were presented to the CJEU.\n\nPending the opening of the proceedings before the CJEU, Enel, EE and SEN /fi.ligaled an additional precautionary petition to the Council of State asking for the suspension of the en-\n\nforceability of the contested ruling of the Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga and the measure recalculating the penalty. With three separate orders with identical content - published on November 16, 2020 - the Council of State granted the request for suspension /fi.ligaled by the Enel companies and, as a guarantee of payment of the penalty in the event of an unfavorable /fi.liganal ruling, required the issue of a /fi.ligarst demand surety in favor of the Competition Authority in an amount equal to that of the recalculated penalty suspended with the precautionary orders. The guarantee was duly provided.\n\nWith a separate ruling, the Council of State also set the date of the /fi.liganal trial session of the appeal for November 11, 2021. That hearing was postponed pending a decision from the CJEU.\n\n## BEG litigation - Italy, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg\n\nFollowing an arbitration proceeding initiated by BEG SpA (BEG) in Italy, Enelpower SpA (Enelpower) obtained a ruling in its favor in 2002, which was upheld by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation in 2010, which entirely rejected the petition for damages with regard to alleged breach by Enelpower of an agreement concerning the construction of a hydroelectric power station in Albania. Subsequently, BEG, acting through its subsidiary Albania BEG Ambient, /fi.ligaled suit against Enelpower and Enel SpA (Enel) in Albania concerning the ma/t\\_t.ligaer, obtaining a ruling from the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana on March 24, 2009, upheld by the Albanian Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, ordering Enelpower and Enel to pay to/r\\_t.ligaious damages of about \u20ac25 million for 2004 as well as an unspeci/fi.ligaed amount of to/r\\_t.ligaious damages for subsequent years. Following the ruling, Albania BEG Ambient demanded payment of more than \u20ac430 million from Enel.\n\nWith a ruling of June 16, 2015, the /fi.ligarst level was completed in the additional suit lodged by Enelpower SpA and Enel SpA with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome asking the Cou/r\\_t.liga to asce/r\\_t.ligaain the liability of BEG SpA for having evaded compliance with the arbitration ruling issued in Italy in favor of Enelpower SpA through the legal action taken by Albania BEG Ambient Shpk. With this action, Enelpower SpA and Enel SpA asked the Cou/r\\_t.liga to /fi.ligand BEG liable and order it to pay damages in the amount that the other could be required to pay to Albania BEG Ambient Shpk in the event of the enforcement of the ruling issued by the Albanian cou/r\\_t.ligas. With the ruling, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome found that BEG SpA did not have standing to be sued, or alternatively, that the request was not admissible for lack of an interest for Enel SpA and Enelpower SpA to sue, as the Albanian ruling had not yet been declared enforceable in any cou/r\\_t.liga. The Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered the se/t\\_t.ligaing o/ff.liga of cou/r\\_t.liga costs. Enel SpA and Enelpower SpA appealed the ruling before the Rome Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, asking that it be ove/r\\_t.ligaurned in full. The ruling is at the decision stage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The proceeding is still pending. On May 20, 2021, the European Cou/r\\_t.liga of Human Rights (ECHR) issued a ruling with which it decided the appeal brought by BEG against the Italian State for violation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 6.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. With this decision, the Cou/r\\_t.liga denied BEG's request to reopen the arbitration proceedings, and also rejected BEG's claim for pecuniary damages amounting to about \u20ac1.2 billion due to the absence of a causal link with the disputed conduct,\n\ngranting it only \u20ac15,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.\n\nNonetheless, on December 29, 2021, BEG, with an action that the Company and its legal counsel deem unfounded and specious, also decided to sue the Italian State before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Milan, to demand, as a consequence of the ECHR ruling, damages for to/r\\_t.ligaious liability in an amount of about \u20ac1.8 billion. In this case, BEG also involved Enel and Enelpower by way of a claim of joint and several liability. The initial hearing is currently scheduled for April 27, 2022. Enel and Enelpower are preparing their defense for the appearance in cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\n## Proceedings unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by Albania BEG Ambient Shpk (ABA) to obtain enforcement of the ruling of the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana of March 24, 2009\n\n## France\n\nIn February 2012, ABA /fi.ligaled suit against Enel and Enelpow-\n\ner with the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris in order to render the ruling of the Albanian cou/r\\_t.liga enforceable in France. Enel SpA and Enelpower SpA challenged the suit. Following the beginning of the case before the Tribunal de Grande Instance, between 2012 and 2013 Enel France was served with a number of ' Saisie Conservatoire de Cr\u00e9ances ' (orders for the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachment of receivables) in favor of ABA to conserve any receivables of Enel in respect of Enel France.\n\nOn January 29, 2018, the Tribunal de Grande Instance issued a ruling in favor of Enel and Enelpower, denying ABA the recognition and enforcement of the Tirana cou/r\\_t.liga's ruling in France for lack of the requirements under French law for the purposes of granting exequatur. Among other issues, the Tribunal de Grande Instance ruled that: (i) the Albanian ruling con/fl.ligaicted with an existing decision (the arbitration ruling of 2002); and that (ii) the fact that BEG sought to obtain in Albania what it was not able to obtain in the Italian arbitration proceeding, resubmi/t\\_t.ligaing the same claim through ABA, represented fraud.\n\nABA appealed that ruling. With a ruling of May 4, 2021, the Paris Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal denied the appeal by ABA in full, ordering it to reimburse Enel and Enelpower \u20ac200,000.00\n\neach for legal costs. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal fully upheld the ruling of the Tribunal de Grande Instance with regard to the con/fl.ligaict of the Albanian ruling with the 2002 arbitration award, which, having the value of res judicata under French law, does not require the cou/r\\_t.liga to assess the issue raised.\n\nOn June 21, 2021, ABA /fi.ligaled an appeal with the Cour de Cassation against the ruling of the Paris Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal. Enel and Enelpower are preparing their defense for the appearance before the Cour de Cassation . Finally, Enel and Enelpower initiated a separate proceeding to obtain release of the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachments granted to ABA and which are no longer valid as a result of the appeal ruling.\n\n## The Netherlands\n\nAt the end of July 2014, ABA /fi.ligaled suit with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Amsterdam to render the ruling of the Albanian cou/r\\_t.liga enforceable in the Netherlands. With a ruling of June 29, 2016, the trial cou/r\\_t.liga recognized the Albanian ruling in the Netherlands and therefore ordered Enel and Enelpower to pay \u20ac433,091,870.00 to ABA, in addition to costs and ancillary charges of \u20ac60,673.78. With the same ruling, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Amsterdam denied ABA's request to declare the ruling provisionally enforceable.\n\nIn a ruling of July 17, 2018, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal upheld the appeal advanced by Enel and Enelpower, ruling that the Albanian judgment cannot be recognized and enforced in the Netherlands. The Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal found that the Albanian decision was arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable and therefore contrary to Dutch public order.\n\nThe proceeding before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal continued with regard  to  the  subordinate  question  raised  by  ABA  with which it asked the Dutch cou/r\\_t.liga to rule on the merits of the dispute in Albania and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the alleged to/r\\_t.ligaious liability of Enel and Enelpower in the failure to build the power plant in Albania.\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal issued a de/fi.liganitive ruling in which it fully quashed the trial cou/r\\_t.liga judgment of June 29, 2016, rejecting any claim made by ABA. The Cou/r\\_t.liga came to this conclusion after a/ffi.ligarming its jurisdiction over ABA's subordinate claim and re-analyzing the merits of the case under Albanian law, /fi.liganding no to/r\\_t.ligaious liability on the pa/r\\_t.liga of Enel and Enelpower. Accordingly, Enel and Enelpower are therefore not liable to pay any amount to ABA, which was in fact ordered by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal to reimburse the companies for the losses incurred in illegitimate conservative seizures, to be quanti/fi.ligaed as pa/r\\_t.liga of a speci/fi.ligac procedure, and the costs of the trial and appeal proceedings. ABA /fi.ligaled an appeal of the ruling with the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga of the Netherlands. Following the /fi.ligaling of the opinion of the Advocate General, who ruled in favor of Enel and Enelpower, requesting the denial of the appeal lodged by ABA, on July 16, 2021 the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga completely rejected ABA's claims, ordering it to reimburse",

The decision of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal has thus become  /fi.liganal  and,  therefore,  no  more  proceedings  are pending in the Netherlands.\n\n## Luxembourg\n\nIn Luxembourg, again at the initiative of ABA, J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg SA was also served with an order for a number of precautionary seizures of any receivables of both Enel Group companies in respect of the bank.\n\nIn parallel ABA /fi.ligaled a claim to obtain enforcement of the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana in Luxembourg. The proceeding is still in the initial stages and no ruling has been issued.\n\n## United States and Ireland\n\nIn 2014, ABA had initiated two proceedings requesting execution of the Albanian ruling before the cou/r\\_t.ligas of the State of New York and Ireland, which both ruled in favor of Enel and Enelpower, respectively, on February 23 and February  26,  2018.  Accordingly,  there  are  no  lawsuits pending in Ireland or New York State.\n\n## Environmental incentives - Spain\n\nWith the Decision of the European Commission of November 27, 2017 on the issue of environmental incentives for thermal power plants, the Commission reached the preliminary  conclusion  that  the  environmental  incentive for coal power plants provided for in Spain's Order ITC/3860/2007 represents State aid pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 107, paragraph 1, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European  Union  (TFEU),  expressing  doubts  about  the compatibility of the incentive with the internal market while recognizing that the incentives are in line with the European Union's environmental policy. The Commission's Directorate-General for Competition has initiated a formal enquiry pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 108, paragraph 2, of the TFEU in order to establish whether the incentive in question constituted state aid compatible with the internal market. On April 13, 2018, Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA, acting as an interested third pa/r\\_t.ligay, submi/t\\_t.ligaed comments contesting this interpretation. Subsequently, on September 8, 2021, the appeal of the decision lodged by Gas Natural (now Naturgy) with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was denied. The enquiry under A/r\\_t.ligaicle 108 of the TFEU is still open.\n\n## Social Bonus - Spain\n\nWith the rulings of October 24 and 25, 2016 and November 2, 2016, the Spanish Tribunal Supremo declared A/r\\_t.ligaicle 45, paragraph 4 of the Spain's Electricity Industry Law 24 of December 26, 2013 void for incompatibility with Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 13, 2009, granting the appeals\n\n/fi.ligaled by Endesa against the obligation to /fi.liganance the Social Bonus mechanism. The Tribunal Supremo recognized Endesa's right to receive all amounts that had been paid to users under the Social Bonus system, provided for in the law declared void by the Tribunal Supremo , for a total of about \u20ac214 million plus interest. The government challenged these rulings of the Tribunal Supremo , requesting that they be ove/r\\_t.ligaurned, but the related appeals were denied.\n\nSubsequently, the government initiated two proceedings before the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga requesting the reopening of the Tribunal Supremo proceedings so that the latter may ask for a preliminary ruling from the European Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice (CJEU). The Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga granted the appeals and, accordingly, the Tribunal Supremo submi/t\\_t.ligaed a petition for a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. All pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including Endesa, presented their respective wri/t\\_t.ligaen conclusions. On October 14, 2021, after the Advocate General had issued a favorable opinion to Endesa, the CJEU issued a preliminary ruling in favor of Endesa, recognizing the incompatibility of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 45, paragraph 4, of the Electricity Industry Law with the Directive referred to above. On December 21, 2021 the Tribunal Supremo issued a /fi.liganal ruling with which it con/fi.ligarmed the provisions of the previous ruling of October 24, 2016. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Tribunal Supremo found that the social bonus /fi.liganancing scheme provided for in A/r\\_t.ligaicle 45, paragraph 4, of the Electricity Industry Law is inapplicable as it does not comply with A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3.2 of Directive 2009/72/EC, and voided Royal Decree 968/2014.\n\n## 'Endesa I' industrial relations dispute - Spain\n\nAfter a series of meetings of the Comisi\u00f3n Negociadora of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement ( Comisi\u00f3n  Negociadora )  which  began  in  October  2017 and continued throughout 2018, in view of the impossibility of reaching an agreement between the social pa/r\\_t.liganers, Endesa noti/fi.ligaed the workers and their union representatives that, with e/ff.ligaect from January 1, 2019, the 4th Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  must  be  considered terminated under the terms of the 'framework guarantee contract' and the 'agreement on the voluntary suspension or resolution of employment contracts in the period 2013-2018', applying from that date the provisions of general labor law, as well as the applicable legal criteria established in the ma/t\\_t.ligaer.\n\nDespite  the  resumption  of  negotiations  within  the Comisi\u00f3n Negociadora in February 2019, the interpretative di/ff.ligaerences between Endesa and the trade union representatives regarding the e/ff.ligaects of the resolution of the 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement with regard, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, to the social bene/fi.ligats granted to retired personnel, led to the initiation of a suit by the unions represented in the company.

The unions appealed this decision before the Tribunal Supremo , while the initial ruling remained provisionally enforceable. Endesa entered the proceeding. In December 2019, Endesa's largest union decided to waive its appeal before the Tribunal Supremo in order to voluntarily submit the dispute to arbitration before the Servicio Interconfederal de Mediaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje (SIMA) with a view to resolving the main issues concerning the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement with the company. The other trade unions involved refused to join the arbitration  proceeding,  electing  to  go  ahead  with  the proceedings before the Tribunal Supremo .\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the arbitration award was issued, with the amendment of ce/r\\_t.ligaain pa/r\\_t.ligas of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement, which was subsequently signed by the social pa/r\\_t.liganers. It entered force on January 23, 2020. On the same date, Endesa also signed two fu/r\\_t.ligaher collective bargaining agreements (a 'framework  guarantee  contract'  and  an  'agreement  on  voluntary measures to suspend or terminate employment contracts') with all the unions present in the company. On June 17, 2020, the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement was published in the Spanish O/ffi.ligacial Journal ( Bolet\u00edn O/fi.ligacial del Estado ), taking full e/ff.ligaect.\n\nOn July 7, 2021, the Tribunal Supremo issued a decision (noti/fi.ligaed on July 22, 2021) in which it denied the appeals lodged by the aforementioned unions in full, upholding the ruling of the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance of March 26, 2019. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Tribunal Supremo a/ffi.ligarmed that social bene/fi.ligats  (including  those  relating  to  electricity  prices) originate exclusively in the collective bargaining agreements, both for employees currently in service and those who have retired, as well as for their family members, with the consequence that the termination of such agreements (as happened in the case of the 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement) produces the general contractual regulation of the conditions established therein for employees currently in service and, for those who have retired and their family members, the de/fi.liganitive extinction of all their rights, until new regulations are introduced with the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. Numerous individual suits have been /fi.ligaled by sta/ff.liga and former employees who had agreed to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in termination incentive agreements in order to obtain judicial con/fi.ligarmation that the termination of the 4th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement did not a/ff.ligaect them. The majority of these proceedings were suspended or were being suspended pending the de/fi.liganition of the collective action pending before the Tribunal Supremo , as the ruling of the la/t\\_t.ligaer, in regarding a 'collective dispute', would have the\n\nvalue of res judicata in respect of individual proceedings concerning the same issue. As a result of the ruling of the Tribunal Supremo of July 7, 2021, the suspension of many of these proceedings was revoked in order to enable the cou/r\\_t.liga to deny the suits.\n\n## 'Endesa II' industrial relations dispute Spain\n\nOn  December  30,  2020,  the Audiencia  Nacional noti/fi.ligaed Endesa a petition for a 'collective dispute' initiated by three trade unions with minority representation /fi.ligaled on December 16, 2020 concerning the cancellation of some 'derogatory provisions' of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The plainti/ff.ligas claim that the contested 'derogatory provisions' would imply the illegitimate abolition of social bene/fi.ligats and economic rights of workers. Endesa considers these provisions to be fully legitimate, in line with the arguments made during proceeding concerning the reduction of social bene/fi.ligats for retired personnel. With a ruling of November 15, 2021, the petitions of the plainti/ff.liga unions were rejected, with veri/fi.ligacation of the legitimacy of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The ruling was appealed by the trade unions before the Tribunal Supremo .\n\n## Furnas-Tractebel litigation - Brazil\n\nIn  1998  the  Brazilian  company  CIEN  (now  Enel  CIEN) signed an agreement with Tractebel for the delivery of electricity  from  Argentina  through  its  Argentina-Brazil interconnection line. As a result of Argentine regulatory changes introduced as a consequence of the economic crisis in 2002, Enel CIEN was unable to make the electricity available to Tractebel.\n\nIn October 2009, Tractebel sued Enel CIEN, which submi/t\\_t.ligaed its defense. Enel CIEN cited force majeure as a result of the Argentine crisis as the main argument in its defense. Out of cou/r\\_t.liga, the Tractebel has indicated that it plans to acquire 30% of the interconnection line involved in the dispute. On February 14, 2019, Enel CIEN received notice of an order beginning expe/r\\_t.liga witness operations, which are still under way. The amount involved in the dispute is estimated at about R$118 million (about \u20ac28 million), plus interest, revaluations and unspeci/fi.ligaed damages. For analogous reasons, in May 2010 Furnas had also /fi.ligaled suit against Enel CIEN for failure to deliver electricity, requesting payment of about R$571.6 million (about \u20ac91 million), in addition to unspeci/fi.ligaed damages, seeking to acquire ownership (in this case 70%) of the interconnection line. The proceeding was decided in Enel CIEN's favor with a ruling of the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a with a de/fi.liganitive ruling of October 18, 2019, which denied all of the claims of Furnas.",

The Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered a uni/fi.ligaed technical appraisal for those cases, the /fi.ligandings of which were pa/r\\_t.ligaly unfavorable to Ampla. The la/t\\_t.ligaer challenged the /fi.ligandings, asking for a new study, which led to the denial of pa/r\\_t.liga of Cibran's petitions. Cibran subsequently challenged the /fi.ligandings of the new study and the ruling was in favor of Ampla.\n\nThe /fi.ligarst suit, /fi.ligaled in 1999 and regarding the years from 1995 to 1999, was adjudicated in September 2014 when the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance issued a ruling against Ampla, levying a /fi.ligane of about R$200,000 (about \u20ac46,000) as well as other damages to be quanti/fi.ligaed separately. Ampla appealed the ruling and the appeal was upheld by the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a , which denied all of Cibran's claims. The ruling became de/fi.liganitive on August 24, 2020.\n\nWith regard to the second case, /fi.ligaled in 2006 and regarding the years from 1987 to 1994, on June 1, 2015, the cou/r\\_t.ligas issued a ruling ordering Ampla to pay R$96,465,103 (about \u20ac23 million) plus interest in pecuniary damages and R$80,000 Brazilian (about \u20ac19,000) in non-pecuniary damages. On July 8, 2015 Ampla appealed the decision with the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a of Rio de Janeiro, which on November 6, 2019 issued a ruling on merits granting Ampla's petition and denying all of Cibran's claims. On November 25, 2019, Cibran /fi.ligaled an appeal against the ruling of the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a of Rio de Janeiro, which was preliminarily denied for formal reasons on September 10, 2020. On January 29, 2021, Cibran appealed ( Agravo de Instrumento ) the decisions before the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ), which was denied on June 8, 2021. On June 22, 2021, Cibran /fi.ligaled an appeal ( Agravo Interno ) with the STJ and the proceeding is pending.\n\nA ruling from the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance is still pending for the remaining four suits for the years 2001 and 2002. The value of all the disputes is estimated at about R$612.1 million (about \u20ac96.02 million).\n\n## Coperva litigation - Brazil\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of the project to expand the grid in rural areas of  Brazil,  in  1982  Companhia  Energ\u00e9tica  do  Cear\u00e1  SA (Coelce), (41) then owned by the Brazilian government and now an Enel Group company, had entered into contracts for the use of the grids of a number of cooperatives es-\n\nblished  speci/fi.ligacally  to  pursue  the  expansion  project. The contracts provided for the payment of a monthly fee by Coelce, which was also required to maintain the networks.\n\nThose  contracts,  between  cooperatives  established  in special circumstances and the then public-sector company, do not speci/fi.ligacally identify the grids governed by the agreements, which prompted a number of the cooperatives to sue Coelce asking for, among other things, a revision of the fees agreed in the contracts.\n\nThese proceedings include the suit /fi.ligaled by Cooperativa de Eletri/fi.ligaca\u00e7\u00e3o Rural do Vale do Acarau Ltda (Coperva) with a value of about R$374 million (about \u20ac59.3 million). Coelce was granted rulings in its favor from the trial cou/r\\_t.liga and the cou/r\\_t.liga of appeal, but Coperva /fi.ligaled a fu/r\\_t.ligaher appeal ( Embargo de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o ) based on procedural issues, which was also denied by the appeal cou/r\\_t.liga in a ruling of January 11, 2016. On February 3, 2016, Coperva lodged an extraordinary appeal before the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) against the appeal cou/r\\_t.liga ruling on the merits, which was granted on November 5, 2018 for the ruling issued in the previous appeal ( Embargo de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o ). On December 3, 2018, Coelce /fi.ligaled an appeal ( Agravo Interno ) against this ruling of the STJ. The proceedings are currently pending.\n\n## AGM litigation - Brazil\n\nIn 1993, Celg-D, (42) the Association of Municipalities of Goi\u00e1s (AGM), the State of Goi\u00e1s and the Bank of Goi\u00e1s reached  an  agreement  ( Convenio )  for  the  payment  of municipal debts to Celg-D through the transfer of the po/r\\_t.ligaion of ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (tax on the circulation of goods and services) that the State would have transferred to those governments. In 2001 the pa/r\\_t.ligaies to the agreement were sued by the individual municipal governments to obtain a ruling that the agreement was invalid, a position then upheld by the Supreme Federal Cou/r\\_t.liga on the grounds of the non-pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation of the local governments themselves in the agreement process. In September 2004, Celg-D reached  a  se/t\\_t.ligalement  with  23  municipalities.  Between 2007 and 2008, Celg-D was again sued on numerous occasions by a number of municipal governments (there are currently 65 pending suits) seeking the restitution of amounts paid under the agreement. Despite the ruling that the agreement was void, Celg-D argues that the payment of the debts on the pa/r\\_t.liga of the local governments is legitimate, as electricity was supplied in accordance with the supply contracts and, accordingly, the claims for res-\n\n<!-- image -->",

The contingent liability deriving from this dispute is covered by the 'Funac' provision established during the privatization of Celg-D.\n\n## ANEEL litigation - Brazil\n\nIn 2014, Eletropaulo (43) initiated an action before the Brazilian federal cou/r\\_t.ligas seeking to void the administrative measure  of  the Ag\u00eancia  Nacional  de  Energia  El\u00e9trica (ANEEL, the national electricity agency), which in 2012 retroactively introduced a negative coe/ffi.ligacient to be applied in determining rates for the following regulatory period (2011-2015). With this provision, the Authority ordered the restitution of the value of some components of the network previously included in rates because they were considered non-existent and denied Eletropaulo's request to include additional components in rates. The administrative measure of ANEEL was challenged and on September 9, 2014 it was suspended on a precautionary basis. The /fi.ligarst-instance proceeding is still in its preliminary stages and the value of the suit is about R$1,288 million (about \u20ac204.1 million).\n\n## El Quimbo - Colombia\n\nA number of legal actions (' acciones de grupo ' and ' acciones populares ') brought by residents and /fi.ligashermen in the a/ff.ligaected area are pending with regard to the El Quimbo project for the construction of a 400 MW hydroelectric plant in the region of Huila (Colombia). More speci/fi.ligacally, the /fi.ligarst collective action, currently in the preliminary stage, was brought by around 1,140 residents of the municipality of Garz\u00f3n, who claim that the construction of the plant would reduce their business revenue by 30%. A second action was brought, between August 2011 and December 2012, by residents and businesses/asso-\n\niations of /fi.ligave municipalities of Huila claiming damages related to the closing of a bridge (Paso El Colegio). With regard to acciones populares , or class action lawsuits, in 2008 a suit was /fi.ligaled by a number of residents of the area demanding, among other things, that the environmental permit be suspended. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this action, on September 11, 2020, the Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga issued an unfavorable ruling against Emgesa, sentencing it to ful/fi.ligall the obligations already provided for in the environmental license. ANLA has submi/t\\_t.ligaed a request for clari/fi.ligacation of the ruling.\n\nAnother acci\u00f3n popular was brought by a number of /fi.ligash farming companies over the alleged impact that /fi.ligalling the Quimbo basin would have on /fi.ligashing in the Betania basin downstream from Quimbo. After a number of precautionary rulings, on February 22, 2016, the Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga issued a ruling allowing generation to continue for six months. The cou/r\\_t.liga ordered Emgesa to prepare a technical design that would ensure compliance with oxygen level requirements and to provide collateral of about 20,000,000,000 Colombian pesos (about \u20ac5.5 million).\n\nThe  Huila  Cou/r\\_t.liga  subsequently  extended  the  six-month time limit, and therefore, in the absence of contrary cou/r\\_t.liga rulings the Quimbo plant is continuing to generate electricity as the oxygenation system installed by Emgesa has so far demonstrated that it can maintain the oxygen levels required by the cou/r\\_t.liga. On March 22, 2018, ANLA and CAM jointly presented the /fi.liganal repo/r\\_t.liga on the monitoring of water quality downstream of the dam of the El Quimbo hydroelectric plant. Both authorities con/fi.ligarmed the compliance of Emgesa with the oxygen level requirements. After the pa/r\\_t.ligaies had /fi.ligaled briefs, on January 12, 2021, it was learned that the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Huila had been issued (it was subsequently noti/fi.ligaed to the company on February 1, 2021). The ruling, while acknowledging that the oxygenation system implemented by Emgesa had mitigated the risks associated with the protection of fauna in the Bethany basin, imposed a series of obligations on the environmental authorities involved, as well as on Emgesa itself. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the latter is required to implement a decontamination project to ensure that the water in the basin does not generate risks for the /fl.ligaora and fauna of the river, which will be subject to veri/fi.ligacation by ANLA, and to make permanent the operation of the oxygenation system, adapting it to comply with the parameters established by ANLA. On March 4, 2021, Emgesa challenged the appeal ruling before the Council of State.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, the Council of State ruled that Emgesa's appeal was admissible. The proceeding is continuing at the appeal level.",

The action is based upon the alleged failure of Codensa to apply a subsidized rate that they claim the users should have paid as Tensi\u00f3n Uno category users (voltage of less than 1 kV) and owners of infrastructure, as established in Resolution no. 82/2002, as amended by Resolution no. 97/2008. The suit is at a preliminary stage. The estimated value of the  proceeding  is  about  337  billion  Colombian  pesos (about \u20ac96 million).\n\n## Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dispute - Slovakia\n\nSlovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne (SE) is involved in a number of cases before the national cou/r\\_t.ligas concerning the 720 MW Gab\u010d\u00edkovo  hydroelectric  plant,  which  is  administered by Vodohospod\u00e1rska V\u00fdsatavba \u0160t\u00e1tny Podnik (VV) and whose operation and maintenance, as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization of SE in 2006, had been entrusted to SE for a period of 30 years under an operating agreement (the VEG Operating Agreement).\n\nImmediately after the closing of the privatization, the Public Procurement O/ffi.ligace (PPO) /fi.ligaled suit with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava seeking to void the VEG Operating Agreement on the basis of alleged violations of the regulations governing public tenders, qualifying the contract as a service contract and as such governed by those regulations. In November 2011 the trial cou/r\\_t.liga ruled in favor of SE, whereupon the PPO immediately appealed the decision.\n\nIn parallel with the PPO action, VV also /fi.ligaled a number of suits, asking in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular for the voidance of the VEG Operating Agreement.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, VV withdrew unilaterally from the VEG Operating Agreement, notifying its termination on March 9, 2015, for breach of contract. On March 9, 2015, the decision of the appeals cou/r\\_t.liga ove/r\\_t.ligaurned the ruling of the trial cou/r\\_t.liga and voided the contract as pa/r\\_t.liga of the action pursued by the PPO. SE lodged an extraordinary appeal against that decision before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga. At a hearing of June 29, 2016, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga denied the appeal. SE then appealed the ruling to the Constitutional\n\nCou/r\\_t.liga, which denied the appeal on January 18, 2017.\n\nIn addition, SE lodged a request for arbitration with the Vienna International Arbitral Centre (VIAC) under the VEG Indemnity Agreement. Under that accord, which had been signed as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization between the National Prope/r\\_t.ligay Fund (now MH Manazment - MHM) of the Slovak Republic and SE, the la/t\\_t.ligaer is entitled to an indemnity in the event of the early termination of the VEG Operating Agreement for reasons not a/t\\_t.ligaributable to SE. The arbitration cou/r\\_t.liga rejected the objection that it did not have jurisdiction and the arbitration proceeding continued to examine the merits of the case, with a ruling on the amount\n\ninvolved being deferred to any subsequent proceeding. On June 30, 2017, the arbitration cou/r\\_t.liga issued its ruling denying the request of SE.\n\nIn parallel with the arbitration proceeding launched by SE, both VV and MHM /fi.ligaled two suits in the Slovakian cou/r\\_t.ligas to void the VEG Indemnity Agreement owing to the alleged connection of the la/t\\_t.ligaer with the VEG Operating Agreement. These proceedings were joindered and, on September 27, 2017, a hearing was held before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava in which the judge denied the request of the plainti/ff.ligas for procedural reasons. Both VV and MHM appealed that decision. The appeal /fi.ligaled by MHM was denied by the Bratislava Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal on June 8, 2019, upholding the decision of the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance in favor of SE. Similarly, the appeal /fi.ligaled by VV was denied, upholding the trial cou/r\\_t.liga decision in favor of SE. VV /fi.ligaled a fu/r\\_t.ligaher appeal ( dovolanie ) against that decision on March 9, 2020, with the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga, to which SE replied with a brief submi/t\\_t.ligaed on June 8, 2020. On March 24, 2021, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga ove/r\\_t.ligaurned the decision of the Bratislava Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, referring the judgment to the la/t\\_t.ligaer cou/r\\_t.liga. On July 21, 2021, SE /fi.ligaled an appeal before the Slovak Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, which was denied on July 29, 2021, and the proceeding is currently pending before the Bratislava Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal. At the local level, SE was sued by VV for alleged unjusti/fi.ligaed enrichment (estimated at about \u20ac360 million plus interest) for the period from 2006 to 2015. SE /fi.ligaled counter-claims for all of the proceedings under way. Developments in\n\nthose proceedings can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the proceedings relating to the years from 2009 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2015 are all pending before the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance. In a number of cases, briefs have been exchanged. For all the proceedings, hearings before the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance were scheduled but then were initially postponed to speci/fi.ligaed dates before being postponed to dates to be determined owing to the pandemic;\n- \u00b7 for 2006-2008, at the hearing of June 26, 2019, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava denied the claims of both pa/r\\_t.ligaies for procedural reasons. The ruling in /fi.ligarst instance was appealed by both VV and SE and the appeals for the years 2006 and 2008 are pending. As for the appeal proceedings relating to 2007, in November 2019, SE had raised a preliminary question which was rejected by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal on January 15, 2020. On August 18, 2020, SE /fi.ligaled an appeal with the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga but the appeal was denied on September 18, 2021. The proceeding is therefore continuing before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal;\n- \u00b7 the proceeding involving 2012 is pending before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal level following VV's appeal of the ruling in favor of SE by the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance.\n\nFinally, in another proceeding before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava, VV asked for SE to return the fee for the transfer from SE to VV of the technology assets of the Gab\u010d\u00edko-\n\n<!-- image -->",

In a decision issued in November 2017, the arbitration board ruled in Chucas' favor, granting recognition of the additional costs incurred in the amount of about $113 million (about \u20ac91 million) and legal costs and found that Chucas was not liable to pay the /fi.liganes to ICE. ICE appealed the arbitration ruling before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga and on September 5, 2019 Chucas was noti/fi.ligaed of the ruling partially upholding ICE's appeal to void the arbitration ruling for a number of formal procedural reasons. On September 11, 2019, Chucas /fi.ligaled a ' recurso de aclaraci\u00f3n y adici\u00f3n ' with the same cou/r\\_t.liga and it was pa/r\\_t.ligaially upheld on June 8, 2020. The Cou/r\\_t.liga's decision expanded on the ruling of September 5, 2019 with information concerning the admission of evidence deposited by Chucas without, however, modifying the decision concerning the voidance of the arbitration award. On July 14, 2020, Chucas /fi.ligaled a new request for arbitration with the AMCHAM CICA for a preliminary estimated amount of about $240 million. On August 14, 2020, ICE /fi.ligaled its response, requesting the dismissal of the proceeding for lack of jurisdiction on the pa/r\\_t.liga of the arbitration tribunal. The request for dismissal was denied by AMCHAM CICA. In parallel, ICE /fi.ligaled precautionary appeals to the Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo against Chucas and the AMCHAM CICA seeking to suspend the arbitration proceedings. While these appeals were preliminarily upheld, they were subsequently denied. In May 2021, Chucas /fi.ligaled its arbitration request complete with preliminary demands, quantifying the value of its claim at about $362 million (about \u20ac305 million). In June 2021, ICE /fi.ligaled its defense, continuing to asse/r\\_t.liga a lack of juris-\n\n. ICE has not made a counterclaim. On August 4, 2021, the arbitration tribunal rejected ICE's claim of lack of jurisdiction. The ma/t\\_t.ligaer has now been submi/t\\_t.ligaed for consideration to the /fi.ligarst section of the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga. The arbitration proceedings remain suspended pending the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga decision on jurisdiction.\n\n## GasAtacama Chile - Chile\n\nOn August 4, 2016, the Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC) /fi.liganed GasAtacama Chile (now Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile) $8.3 million (about 5.8 billion Chilean pesos) for information provided by the la/t\\_t.ligaer to the CDECSING ( Centro de Despacho Econ\u00f3mico de Carga ) between January 1, 2011 and October 29, 2015, relating to the Minimum Technical and Minimum Operating Time variables at the Atacama plant.\n\nEnel Generaci\u00f3n Chile appealed this measure with the SEC, which denied the appeal on November 2, 2016. Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile appealed this decision before the Santiago Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, which on April 9, 2019, issued a ruling reducing the /fi.ligane to $432,000 (about 290 million Chilean pesos). Both Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile and the SEC appealed this decision before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga of Chile. On June 28, 2019, a hearing was held for both pa/r\\_t.ligaies to submit arguments and on January 15, 2020 the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga upheld the ruling of the Santiago Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, leaving unchanged the reduction in the /fi.ligane established by that cou/r\\_t.liga. The adjusted /fi.ligane was paid on March 12, 2020.\n\nIn parallel, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile had also /fi.ligaled an appeal before the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, claiming that the legal provisions  under  which  the  SEC  imposed  the  /fi.ligane  had been repealed at the time the penalty was issued. On July 17, 2018, the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga rejected Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile's appeal.\n\nIn relation to this issue, some operators of the Sistema Interconectado  del  No/r\\_t.ligae  Grande (SING),  including  Aes Gener SA, El\u00e9ctrica Angamos SA and Engie Energ\u00eda Chile SA, sued Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile to obtain damages in an amount of about \u20ac58 million (the former) and about \u20ac141 million (the la/t\\_t.ligaer two). The disputes were joindered in pa/r\\_t.liga in a single proceeding and are currently pending. After the suspension of the proceeding under the state of national emergency declared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the plainti/ff.liga asked for the proceeding to resume, a request the cou/r\\_t.liga granted.

Under the special rules then in force, subject to maintaining the bonds until 2008, the interest paid by Ampla to its subsidiary was not subject to withholding tax in Brazil.\n\nHowever, the /fi.liganancial crisis of 1998 forced the Panama-\n\nnian company to re/fi.liganance itself with its Brazilian parent, which for that purpose obtained loans from local banks. The tax authorities considered this /fi.liganancing to be the equivalent of the early redemption of the bonds, with the consequent loss of entitlement to the exemption from withholding tax.\n\nIn December 2005, Ampla carried out a spin-o/ff.liga that involved the transfer of the residual FRN debt and the associated rights and obligations to Ampla Investimentos e Servi\u00e7os SA.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, the C\u00e2mara Superior de Recursos Fiscais (the highest level of administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas) issued a ruling against Ampla, for which the company promptly asked that body for clari/fi.ligacations. On October 15, 2013, Ampla was noti/fi.ligaed of the denial of the request for clari/fi.ligacation ( Embargo de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o ), thereby upholding the previous adverse decision. The company provided security\n\nfor the debt and on June 27, 2014 continued litigation before the ordinary cou/r\\_t.ligas ( Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a ).\n\nIn December 2017, the cou/r\\_t.liga appointed an expe/r\\_t.liga to examine the issue in greater detail in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the future ruling. In September 2018, the expe/r\\_t.liga submi/t\\_t.ligaed a repo/r\\_t.liga, requesting additional documentation.\n\nIn December 2018, the company provided the additional documentation and is awaiting the cou/r\\_t.liga's assessment of the arguments and documents presented.\n\nThe amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2021 was about \u20ac211 million.\n\n## IRPJ/CSLL - Eletropaulo\n\nOn October 5, 2021, Eletropaulo received an assessment notice from the Brazilian tax authorities contesting the deductibility for income tax purposes ( Imposto sobre a Renda das Pessoas Jur\u00eddicas - IRPJ and Contribui\u00e7\u00e3o Social sobre o Lucro L\u00edquido - CSLL) of the amo/r\\_t.ligaization of the increased amounts generated by extraordinary corporate transactions carried out before the acquisition of the company by the Enel Group. The contested period runs from 2017 to 2019.\n\nConsidering its position sound, the company presented its defense at the /fi.ligarst level of administrative adjudication.\n\nThe amount involved in the dispute was about \u20ac110 million at December 31, 2021.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn July 2000, Eletropaulo /fi.ligaled suit seeking a tax credit for PIS  ( Programa  Integra\u00e7\u00e3o  Social )  paid  in  application  of regulations  (Decree  Laws  2.445/1988  and  2.449/1988) that were subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). In May 2012, the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) issued a /fi.liganal ruling in favor of the company that recognized the right to the credit.\n\nIn 2002, before the issue of that favorable /fi.liganal ruling, the company had o/ff.ligaset its credit against other federal taxes. This behavior was contested by the federal tax authorities but the company, claiming it had acted correctly, challenged in cou/r\\_t.liga the assessments issued by the federal tax authorities. Following defeat at the initial level of adjudication, the company appealed.\n\nThe amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2021 was about \u20ac106 million.\n\n## ICMS - Ampla, Coelce and Eletropaulo\n\nThe States of Rio de Janeiro, Cear\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo issued a  number  of  tax  assessments  against  Ampla  Energia  e Servi\u00e7os  SA  (for  the  years  1996-1999  and  2007-2017), Companhia  Energ\u00e9tica  do  Cear\u00e1  (Coelce)  (2003,  2004, 2006-2012, 2015 and 2016) and Eletropaulo (2008-2020), challenging the deduction of ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (tax on the circulation of\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  companies  challenged  the  assessments, arguing that they correctly deducted the tax and asse/r\\_t.ligaing that the assets, the purchase of which generated the ICMS, are intended for use in their electricity distribution activities.\n\nThe companies are continuing to defend their actions at the various levels of adjudication.\n\nThe amount involved in the disputes totaled approximately \u20ac79 million at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Withholding tax - Endesa Brasil\n\nOn November 4, 2014, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an assessment against Endesa Brasil SA (now Enel Brasil SA) alleging the failure to apply withholding tax to payments of allegedly higher dividends to non-resident recipients.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2009, Endesa Brasil, as a result of the /fi.ligarst-time application of the IFRS, had derecognized goodwill, recognizing the e/ff.ligaects in equity, on the basis of the correct  application  of  the  accounting  standards  it  had adopted. The Brazilian tax authorities, however, asse/r\\_t.ligaed - during an audit - that the accounting treatment was incorrect and that the e/ff.ligaects of the derecognition should have been recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss. As a result, the corresponding amount (about \u20ac202 million) was reclassi/fi.ligaed as a payment of income to non-residents and, therefore, subject to withholding tax of 15%.\n\nIt should be noted that the accounting treatment adopted by the company was agreed with the external auditor and also con/fi.ligarmed by a speci/fi.ligac legal opinion issued by a local /fi.ligarm.\n\nFollowing  unfavorable  rulings  from  the  administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas, the company is continuing to defend its actions and the appropriateness of the accounting treatment in cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2021 was about \u20ac58 million.\n\n## ICMS - Coelce\n\nThe  State  of  Cear\u00e1  has  /fi.ligaled  various  tax  assessments against Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 SA (Coelce) over the years (for tax periods from 2005 to 2014), contesting the determination of the deductible po/r\\_t.ligaion of the ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (tax on the circulation of goods and services) and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the method of calculation of the pro-rata deduction with reference to the revenue deriving from the application of a special rate envisaged by the Brazilian government for the sale of electricity to low-income households ( Baixa Renda ). The company has appealed the individual assessments, arguing that the tax deduction was calculated correctly. The company is defending its actions in the various levels of jurisdiction.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2021 was about \u20ac40 million.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn  December  1995,  the  Brazilian  government  increased the rate of the federal PIS ( Programa Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social ) tax from 0.50% to 0.65% with the issue of a provisional measure (Executive Provisional Order).\n\nSubsequently, the provisional measure was re-issued /fi.ligave times before its de/fi.liganitive rati/fi.ligacation into law in 1998. Under Brazilian legislation, an increase in the tax rate (or the establishment of a new tax) can only be ordered by law and take e/ff.ligaect 90 days after its publication.\n\nEletropaulo therefore /fi.ligaled suit arguing that an increase in\n\nthe tax rate would only have been e/ff.ligaective 90 days after the last Provisional Order, claiming that the e/ff.ligaects of the /fi.ligarst four provisional measures should be considered void (since they were never rati/fi.ligaed into law). This dispute ended in April 2008 with recognition of the validity of the increase in the PIS rate sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the /fi.ligarst provisional measure. In May 2008, the Brazilian tax authorities /fi.ligaled a suit against Eletropaulo to request payment of taxes corresponding to the rate increase from March 1996 to December 1998. Eletropaulo has fought the request at the various levels of adjudication, arguing that the time limit for the issue of the notice of assessment had lapsed. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, since more than /fi.ligave years have passed since the taxable event (December 1995, the date of the /fi.ligarst provisional measure) without issuing any formal instrument, the right of the tax authorities to request the payment of additional taxes and the authority to unde/r\\_t.ligaake legal action to obtain payment have been challenged.\n\nIn 2017, following the unfavorable decisions issued in previous rulings, Eletropaulo /fi.ligaled an appeal in defense of its rights and its actions with the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) and the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). The proceedings are still pending while the amounts subject to dispute have been covered by a bank guarantee.\n\nWith regard to the request of the O/ffi.ligace of the A/t\\_t.ligaorney General of the Brazilian National Treasury Depa/r\\_t.ligament to replace the bank guarantee with a deposit in cou/r\\_t.liga, the cou/r\\_t.liga of second instance granted the petition. The company therefore replaced the bank guarantee with a cash deposit and /fi.ligaled a clari/fi.ligacation motion against the related decision, which is currently awaiting a decision.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2021 was about \u20ac39 million.\n\n## FINSOCIAL - Eletropaulo\n\nFollowing a /fi.liganal ruling issued by the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga on September 11, 2011, Eletropaulo was recognized the right to compensation for ce/r\\_t.ligaain FINSOCIAL credits (social contributions) relating to sums paid from September 1989 to March 1992.",

This audit, which began in 2016, involved corporate income tax, value added tax and withholding taxes (mainly for the years 2012 to 2014).\n\nWith reference to the main claims, the companies involved\n\nhave challenged the related assessments at the /fi.ligarst administrative level ( Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central - TEAC), defending the correctness of their actions. With regard to the disputes concerning corporate income tax, the issues for which an unfavorable outcome is considered possible amounted to about \u20ac155 million at December 31, 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Endesa and its subsidiaries are mainly defending the appropriateness of the criteria adopted for the deductibility of ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial expense (about \u20ac25 million) and costs for decommissioning nuclear power plants (about \u20ac6 million).\n- \u00b7 Enel Iberia is defending the appropriateness of the criterion adopted for determining the deductibility of capital losses deriving from stock sales (around \u20ac106 million) and ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial expense (around \u20ac18 million);\n\nIn 2021, the Spanish tax authorities concluded a new general audit for the years from 2015 to 2018. The companies involved challenged the related assessments at the /fi.ligarst level of administrative adjudication (TEAC), arguing that they had acted correctly.\n\nIn relation to the main dispute regarding corporate income tax, which concerned the deductibility of ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial charges, the dispute for which an adverse outcome is considered possible has a value of about \u20ac232 million at December 31, 2021 (Enel Iberia \u20ac219 million and Endesa SA \u20ac13 million).\n\n## Income tax - Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL\n\nOn June 7, 2017, the Spanish tax authorities issued a notice of assessment to Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL, contesting the treatment of the merger of Enel Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Renovables SA ('EUFER') into Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL in 2011\n\nas a tax neutral transaction, asse/r\\_t.ligaing that the transaction had no valid economic reason.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, the company appealed the assessment at the /fi.ligarst administrative level ( Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central - TEAC), defending the appropriateness of the tax treatment applied to the merger. The company has provided  the  suppo/r\\_t.ligaing  documentation  demonstrating the synergies achieved as a result of the merger in order to prove the existence of a valid economic reason for the transaction. On December 10, 2019, the TEAC denied the appeal and the company is continuing to defend its actions in cou/r\\_t.liga ( Audiencia Nacional ).\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2021 was about \u20ac98 million.\n\n## Tax litigation in Italy\n\n## Withholding tax - Enel Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale\n\nAs a result of a tax audit initiated in March 2018 and following a subsequent investigation conducted with questionnaires submi/t\\_t.ligaed to the banks involved as assignees in ce/r\\_t.ligaain transfers of receivables from Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale SpA (SEN) in respect of mass market customers under a framework agreement, on December 19, 2018, the Revenue Agency - Regional Directorate of Lazio - Large Taxpayers O/ffi.ligace, noti/fi.ligaed the company of an assessment in respect of the alleged violation of withholding tax obligations relating to the amounts paid to the banks as pa/r\\_t.liga of the aforementioned transfers in 2013.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the dispute arises from an assessment by the O/ffi.ligace that: (i) reclassi/fi.ligaed, for tax purposes only, the assignment of receivables as a /fi.liganancing transaction; (ii) asse/r\\_t.ligaed an alleged withholding obligation for the company commensurate with the cost of the transaction (as the di/ff.ligaerence between the nominal value of the assigned receivables and the transfer price), reconstructing the subsequent transactions  involving  the  assigned  receivables  (fu/r\\_t.ligaher sales and/or securitizations with non-residents carried out by the banks), in which the company had no role.\n\nIn the /fi.ligarst stages of the proceeding, which arose following SEN's appeal of the assessment, the company's objections concerning the illegitimacy of the O/ffi.ligace's reclassi/fi.ligacation of the transaction for tax purposes and, consequently, of the payment /fl.ligaows were not upheld, despite signi/fi.ligacant procedural violations in the assessment activity.\n\nBelieving that it has valid legal grounds to continue the dispute, the company /fi.ligaled an appeal with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, asse/r\\_t.ligaing the illegitimacy of the tax claim for violation and false application of the rules that, in the view of the trial cou/r\\_t.liga, permit the classi/fi.ligacation of the income generated by the assignment of receivables as 'prope/r\\_t.ligay income', which, consequently, would require SEN to apply withholding tax.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2021 is about \u20ac81 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Future accounting standards\n\nThe  following  provides  a  list  of  accounting  standards, amendments and interpretations that will take e/ff.ligaect for the Group after December 31, 2021.\n\n- -the criteria to adopt in classifying a liability as current or non-current, specifying the meaning of right of an entity to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement and that that right must exist at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period;\n- \u00b7 ' Amendments to IAS 1 - Classi/fi.ligacation of Liabilities as Current or Non-current ', issued in January 2020. The amendments regard the provisions of IAS 1 concerning the presentation of liabilities. More speci/fi.ligacally, the changes clarify:\n- -that the classi/fi.ligacation is una/ff.ligaected by the intentions or  expectations  of  management  about  when  the entity will exercise its right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement of a liability;\n- -that se/t\\_t.ligalement regards the transfer to the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.\n- -that the right to defer exists if and only if the entity satis/fi.ligaes the terms of the loan at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, even if the creditor does not verify compliance until later; and\n\nThe amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with earlier application permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n\n- \u00b7 ' Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework ' issued in May 2020. The amendments are intended to replace a reference to the de/fi.liganitions of assets and liabilities provided by the Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing issued in March 2018 (Conceptual Framework) without signi/fi.ligacantly changing its provisions.\n\nThe amendments also add to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for transactions and other events within the scope of 'IAS 37 - Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets' or 'IFRIC 21 - Levies', an acquirer applies IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 (instead of the Conceptual Framework) to identify the liabilities it has assumed in a business combination.\n\nFinally, the amendments clarify the existing guidelines in IFRS 3 for contingent assets acquired in a business combination, specifying that, if it is not sure that an asset exists at the acquisition date, the contingent asset shall not be recognized.\n\nThe amendments will take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 ' Amendments to IAS 16 - Prope/r\\_t.ligay, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use ', issued in May 2020. The amendments prohibit a company from deducting from the cost of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a\n- company will recognize such sales proceeds and related cost in pro/fi.ligat or loss. The amendments will take effect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.

The document mainly comprises amendments to the following standards:\n- \u00b7 ' Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Ful/fi.ligalling a Contract ', issued in May 2020. The amendments specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of ful/fi.ligalling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. To this end, the cost of ful/fi.ligalling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. These consist of the incremental costs of ful/fi.ligalling that contract or the allotment of other costs that relate directly to ful/fi.ligalling contracts. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Early application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n- -' IFRS 1 - First-Time Adoption of International Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Standards '; the amendment simpli/fi.ligaes the application of IFRS 1 by an investee (subsidiary, associate or joint venture) that becomes a /fi.ligarst-time adopter of IFRS Standards after its parent has already adopted them. More speci/fi.ligacally, if the investee adopts the IFRSs after its parent and applies IFRS 1.D16 (a), then the investee can elect to measure the cumulative translation di/ff.ligaerences for all foreign operations at the amounts that would be included in the parent's consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, based on parent's date of transition to the IFRSs;\n- -' IFRS  16  -  Leases ';  the  International  Accounting Standards  Board  amended  Illustrative  Example  13 accompanying 'IFRS 16 - Leases'. Speci/fi.ligacally, the amendment  eliminates  the  potential  for  confusion in the application of IFRS 16 created by the way in which Illustrative Example 13 had illustrated the requirements for lease incentives. The example had  included  a  reimbursement  relating  to  leasehold  improvements  without  explaining  whether the reimbursement quali/fi.ligaed as a lease incentive. The amendment removes the illustration of a reimbursement  relating  to  leasehold  improvements from the example;\n- -' IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments '; with regard to fees included in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of  /fi.liganancial  liabilities,  the  amendment  clari/fi.ligaes  the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modi/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the terms of the original /fi.liganancial liability.

Enel Produzione paid around \u20ac1,039 million for the company, as well as an initial price adjustment at closing of around \u20ac226 million to re/fl.ligaect the mark-to-market valuation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain hedging derivatives of ERG Power Generation concerning pa/r\\_t.liga of the future power to be generated by the ERG Hydro plants. The agreement also provides for an additional price adjustment in the coming months, which will be calculated mainly on the basis of the changes in ERG Hydro's net working capital and net /fi.liganancial position, and the level of water reserves in ce/r\\_t.ligaain basins included in the sale. The plants owned by ERG Hydro, which are located in the Umbria, Lazio, and Marche regions, have an installed capacity of 527 MW and an average annual output of around 1.5 TWh.\n\n## Enel places a \u20ac2.75 billion 'sustainabilitylinked bond' in three tranches on the eurobond market\n\nOn January 10, 2022, Enel Finance International NV, the Dutch-registered  /fi.liganance  company  controlled  by  Enel SpA, placed a \u20ac2.75 billion 'sustainability-linked bond' in three tranches, linked to the achievement of Enel's sustainability objective for the reduction of direct greenhouse  gas  emissions  (Scope  1),  contributing  to  the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 'Climate Action' and in line with the Group's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework.\n\n## Fitch revises Enel's long-term rating to 'BBB+' and makes no change to the sho/r\\_t.ligaterm rating of 'F-2'. The outlook is stable\n\nOn February 4, 2022, Fitch Ratings announced that it has revised Enel SpA's long-term rating to 'BBB+' from the previous 'A-'. The agency also con/fi.ligarmed Enel's sho/r\\_t.ligaterm rating at 'F-2'. The outlook remains stable.\n\nAccording  to  the  agency,  the  change  in  Enel's  rating mainly re/fl.ligaects the expected increase in /fi.liganancial leverage in the medium term due to the investment oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities that have prompted Enel to gradually expand its capital expenditure plans in response to the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As the days went by, hostilities escalated, with an intensi/fi.ligacation of clashes.\n\nThe  Russian  military  intervention  in  Ukraine  triggered prompt  reactions  from  various  countries  and  international  organizations.  The  European  Council  called  on Russia to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw its armed forces from Ukraine in compliance with international law. The United Nations General Assembly, meeting in an emergency session, also approved a resolution condemning the Russian military action in Ukraine, asking Russia to withdraw the army.\n\nAt the same time, the European Commission is addressing the humanitarian crisis engendered by the con/fl.ligaict in Ukraine, with the deployment of humanitarian aid and emergency aid programs, including increased /fi.liganancial suppo/r\\_t.liga to Ukraine.\n\nNegotiations are under way between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies involved to seek a diplomatic solution that will prevent the situation from becoming a threat to international peace and security.\n\nThe European Union and other countries (e.g., the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Switzerland and others) have imposed severe sanctions on Russia, which, although of varying e/ff.ligaectiveness, have impacted strategic sectors of the Russian economy and the /fi.liganancial sector and imposed personal restrictions on the Russian President and other political and business /fi.ligagures. The main European sanctions involve:\n\n- \u00b7 blocking the access of Russian banks to European /fi.liganancial markets;\n- \u00b7 freezing Russian assets in the euro area;\n- \u00b7 imposing expo/r\\_t.liga control measures (including a ban on the expo/r\\_t.liga of goods to Russia and Belarus in the aviation, maritime, space, technology and 'dual-use' sectors);\n- \u00b7 excluding major Russian banks from the international SWIFT transaction system;\n- \u00b7 freezing commercial transactions with the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk;\n- \u00b7 blocking current accounts with the Sberbank banking group;\n- \u00b7 freezing the personal assets of the Russian President, oligarchs, politicians and senior executives of the Russian companies that suppo/r\\_t.liga him.\n- \u00b7 closing airspace to Russian /fl.ligaights;\n\nThese sanctions have had an initial impact on the exchange rate of the ruble, which has depreciated sharply against the euro and the US dollar, on local interest rates (which  were  increased  to  20%  by  the  Russian  Central Bank) and on the share prices of companies listed on the Moscow Stock Exchange (with a signi/fi.ligacant decline being recorded in March).\n\nFinancial di/ffi.ligaculties have also been associated with an increased level of IT risk, to which businesses and governments are exposed, making it necessary to adopt adequate defense measures and stringent internal controls to safeguard their digital infrastructure.\n\nConsidering this background, the Enel Group has activated a task force to carefully monitor the status and evolution of current developments and manage potential risks. Today, the Enel Group is present in Russia with a number of companies in which it holds control or joint control with other investors. More speci/fi.ligacally, the Enel Group controls:\n\n- \u00b7 Enel Green Power Rus LLC (a 100% indirect subsidiary of Enel SpA), a company that provides services for the development of renewable energy projects and which holds 100% stakes in four renewable generation companies;\n- \u00b7 Enel Russia PJSC (56.43% owned by Enel SpA), a company listed on the Moscow Stock Exchange that generates electricity, mainly with three thermal generation plants, and holds 100% stakes in three renewable generation companies;\n- \u00b7 Enel X Rus LLC (a 99% indirect subsidiary of Enel SpA). Enel SpA also directly holds an investment of 49.5% in a joint venture (Rusenergosbyt LLC) operating in the End-user Markets Business Line.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the three thermal generation plants operating in Russia had an installed capacity of 5,276 MW, while renewables installed wind capacity was equal to 228 MW (including 138 MW of pa/r\\_t.ligaial additional capacity of the Murmansk Kolskaya Wind Farm plant, which is under construction).\n\nThe contribution of the Russian companies to the main consolidated pe/r\\_f.ligaormance aggregates in 2021 (considering the average 2021 euro/ruble exchange rate of 87.18) is not signi/fi.ligacant and includes revenue of \u20ac564 million (0.6% of the total consolidated revenue of the Enel Group), operating pro/fi.ligat of \u20ac51 million (0.7% of total Enel Group operating pro/fi.ligat) and pro/fi.ligat of \u20ac64 million (2.0% of Enel Group pro/fi.ligat).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, considering the end-2021 euro/ruble exchange rate of 85.35, the main statement of /fi.liganancial position items of the Enel Group companies operating in Russia regarded:\n\n- \u00b7 under assets, \u20ac846 million of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, \u20ac47 million in deferred tax assets, \u20ac44 million in trade receivables and \u20ac123 million in cash and cash equivalents;",

Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the Enel Group is also assessing developments associated with the counter-sanctions being deployed by Russia against investments in the country.\n\nThe Enel Group is conducting analyses to assess the indirect impacts of the war in Ukraine on operations, the /fi.liganancial situation and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance in the main euro-area countries in which it operates, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular regard to sho/r\\_t.ligaages of raw materials from the areas a/ff.ligaected by the con/fl.ligaict and the generalized increase in commodity prices.\n\nThe  Enel  Group  does  not  have  gas  supply  contracts (pipeline and LNG) with Russia, but in Italy measures are being evaluated at the regulatory level to reduce the demand for gas and to contain price volatility on the markets. In Spain (where the Group is present with its subsidiary Endesa SA), in addition to regulatory developments, we are analyzing the e/ff.ligaects on nuclear fuel orders from Russia.\n\nPa/r\\_t.ligaicular a/t\\_t.ligaention is also paid to the impacts of the war on activities in Slovakia, where the Enel Group is present with the jointly controlled company Slovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne AS (SE), of which Enel SpA indirectly holds 33%. It operates in the generation of electricity from nuclear, thermal and hydroelectric sources with an installed capacity of 4 GW. SE's nuclear plants have links with Russia involving technical-operational  activities  (supply  of  nuclear  fuel and technology), investments (Russian suppliers involved in the construction of the MO3/4 plant who are currently not targeted by the sanctions) and loans (SE's debt expo-\n\nre to Sberbank).\n\nIn this highly /fl.ligauid situation, characterized by considerable regulatory unce/r\\_t.ligaainty and high and volatile prices, the Enel Group is carefully monitoring macroeconomic and business variables in order to develop the most accurate real-time estimates of impacts connected with regulatory changes, sanctions and restrictions on assets, as well as on suppliers and contracts applicable to the Enel Group, taking due account of the recommendations issued by national and supranational organizations on this issue. (44)\n\n## Enel /fi.liganalizes renewal of pa/r\\_t.liganership with Cinven in U/fi.liganet Latam\n\nOn March 24, 2022, Enel X International Srl (Enel X International), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enel X Srl (Enel X), closed the agreement signed on December 21, 2021 with a holding company controlled by the Sixth Cinven Fund and a holding company controlled by the Seventh Cinven Fund acquiring indirectly, through a holding company, about 79% of the share capital of U/fi.liganet Latam SLU ('U/fi.liganet' or the 'Company') from the Sixth Cinven Fund and simultaneously selling 80.5% of the Company's share capital to the Seventh Cinven Fund. As a result, Enel X International now indirectly retains a stake equal to 19.5% of U/fi.liganet, renewing the pa/r\\_t.liganership in the Company with Cinven.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, Enel X International, which previously indirectly owned a stake of about 21% in the Company, exercised the call option to acquire around 79% of the share capital of U/fi.liganet for \u20ac1,320 million. At the same time, Enel X International received around \u20ac207 million as a distribution of available reserves from U/fi.liganet and simultaneously sold 80.5% of the Company's share capital to the Seventh Cinven Fund for about \u20ac1,186 million.\n\nUnder the agreement, Enel X International, in addition to indirectly retaining 19.5% of the share capital of U/fi.liganet, keeps representation on the la/t\\_t.ligaer and its holding company's boards of directors, retaining standard minority shareholder protection rights.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board of Statutory Auditors will transmit that report to the Board of Directors promptly, accompanied by any comments it may have, in accordance with Article 19, paragraph 1(a), of Decree 39/2010.\n\nAs at the date of this report, the audit firm also reported that it did not prepare any management letter for 2021;\n\n- \u00b7 we  monitored  the  financial  reporting  process,  the  appropriateness  of  the administrative and accounting system and its reliability in representing operational events, as well as compliance with the principles of sound administration in the performance of the Company's business and we have no comments in that regard. We  conducted  our  checks  by  obtaining  information  from  the  head  of  the Administration, Finance and Control department (taking due account of the head's role as the officer responsible for the preparation of the Company's financial reports), examining Company documentation and analyzing the findings of the examinations performed by KPMG SpA. The Chief Executive Officer and the officer responsible for the preparation of the financial reports of Enel issued a statement (regarding the\n\n<!-- image -->",

The statement also affirmed that the appropriateness of the administrative and accounting procedures used in the preparation of the separate financial statements of the Company had been verified in an assessment of the internal control system for financial reporting (supported by the findings of the independent  testing  performed  by  a  qualified  external  advisor)  and  that  the assessment of the internal control system did not identify any material issues. An analogous statement was prepared for the consolidated financial statements for 2021 of the Enel Group.;\n\n- \u00b7 we  monitored  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control  system, primarily through constant participation of the head of the Audit department of the Company in the meetings of the Board of Statutory Auditors and holding about half of the meetings jointly with the Control and Risk Committee, as well as through periodic meetings with the body charged with overseeing the operation of and compliance with the organizational and management model adopted by the Company pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001. In the light of our examination and in the absence of significant issues, the internal control and risk management system can be considered adequate and effective. In February 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company expressed an analogous assessment of the situation and also noted, in November 2021, that the main risks associated with the strategic targets set out in the 2022-2024  Business Plan were compatible with the management of the Company in a manner consistent with those targets;\n- \u00b7 in 2021 no petitions were received by the Board of Auditors nor did we receive any complaints concerning circumstances deemed censurable pursuant to Article 2408 of the Italian Civil Code;\n- \u00b7 we monitored the effective implementation of the Corporate Governance Code, verifying the compliance of Enel's corporate  governance arrangements with the recommendations of the Code.

This is a best practice that the Board of Statutory Auditors intended to adopt even in the absence of a specific recommendation of the Corporate Governance Code, a 'peer-to-peer review' approach, i.e. the assessment not only of the functioning of the body as a whole, but also of the style and content of the contribution provided by each of the auditors. The approach adopted in performing the board review for 2021 and the findings of that review are described in detail in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure for 2021, revealing  the unanimous agreement of the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors concerning the complete adequacy of its size, membership and functioning. Compared with 2020, it was confirmed that the oversight body has adopted effective and  efficient  operating  methods  that  comply  with  the  reference  regulatory framework.\n\nNote also that, based on the findings of the board review and taking account of the provisions of the policy on the diversity of its members (approved on January 29, 2018), the Board of Statutory Auditors - in view of the election of a new Board of Statutory Auditors following the expiry of its term, scheduled for the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the separate financial statements of the Company for 2021 - issued specific guidance for the shareholders (available on the company website) regarding the qualifications that the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors should possess;\n\n<!-- image -->",

In performing that activity, we monitored the adequacy of the organizational, administrative, reporting and control system established by the Company in order to enable the accurate representation in the consolidated non-financial statement for 2021 of the activity of the Enel Group, its results and its impacts in the non-financial areas referred to in Article 3, paragraph 1, of Decree 254, and have no comments in this regard.

Those rules (which can be consulted on the corporate website) contain appropriate provisions directed at subsidiaries to enable Enel to comply with statutory public disclosure requirements, pursuant to Article 114, paragraph 2, of the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation ;\n- \u00b7 in 2002 the Company also adopted (and has subsequently updated, most recently in February 2021) a Code of Ethics (also available on the corporate website) that expresses the commitments and ethical responsibilities involved in the conduct of business,  regulating  and  harmonizing  corporate  conduct  in  accordance  with standards of maximum transparency and fairness with respect to all stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 with regard to the provisions of Legislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001 -  which introduced into Italian law a system of administrative (in fact criminal) liability for companies for certain types of offences committed by its directors, managers or employees on behalf of or to the benefit of the company - since July 2002 Enel has adopted a compliance program consisting of a 'general part' and various 'special parts' concerning the difference offences specified by Legislative Decree 231/2001 that the program is intended to prevent.

This body, appointed in July 2020, is still composed of three external members who jointly have specific professional expertise on corporate organization matters and corporate criminal law. The Board of Statutory Auditors received adequate information on the main activities carried out in 2021  by that body, including in meetings with its members. Our examination of those activities found no facts or situations that would require mention in this report;\n\n- \u00b7 in 2021, the Board of Statutory Auditors issued a favorable opinion (at the meeting of February 3, 2021) on the 2021 Audit Plan, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7.C.1, letter c) of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies (which the Company still applied as at that date);\n- \u00b7 a report on the fixed and variable compensation accrued by those who served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and other  directors  in  2021  for  their  respective  positions  and  any  compensation instruments awarded to them is contained in the second section of the Report on Remuneration Policy for 2022 and Remuneration Paid in 2021 referred to in Article 123-ter of the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation (for the sake of brevity, 'Remuneration Report' hereinafter), approved by the Board of Directors, acting on a proposal of the Nomination and Compensation Committee on April 6, 2022, which will be published in compliance with the time limits established by law. The design of these remuneration instruments is in line with best practices as it complies with the principle of establishing a link with appropriate financial and non-financial performance targets and pursuing the creation of shareholder value over the medium and long term. The proposals to the Board of Directors concerning such forms of compensation and the determination of the associated parameters were prepared by the  Nomination  and  Compensation  Committee,  which  is  made  up  entirely  of independent directors, drawing on the findings of benchmark analyses, including at the international level, conducted by an independent consulting firm. In addition, the second  section  of  the  Remuneration  Report  contains,  in  compliance  with  the applicable Consob regulations, specific disclosures on the remuneration received in 2021 by the members of the oversight body and by key management personnel (in aggregate form for the latter).\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors also supervised the process of preparing the remuneration  policy  for  2022  -  described  in  full  in  the  first  section  of  the Remuneration Report, without finding any critical issues. In particular, oversight activity examined the consistency of the various measures envisaged by that policy with (i) the provisions of Directive (EU) 2017/828 as transposed into Italian law, with (ii) the recommendations of the Italian Corporate Governance Code, as well as with\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  analysis  was  performed  on  the  basis  of  the  data  reported  in  the documentation published on the occasion of 2021 shareholders' meetings by issuers belonging to a peer group composed - unlike that used for the analogous analysis concerning the Board of Directors - exclusively of Italian companies belonging the FTSE MIB index ( 2 ). The functions that the Italian legal system assigns to the Board of Statutory Auditors differentiate the latter from the bodies with oversight functions provided for in the one-tier and two-tier governance systems commonly adopted in other countries. For the purpose of identifying the peer group, the consultant, in agreement with the Board of Statutory Auditors, decided to exclude certain industrial companies belonging to the FTSE MIB index that have concentrated ownership structures, while evaluating some companies in the FTSE MIB index operating in the financial services industry.\n\nThe analysis showed that, on the basis of the data as at December 31, 2020, Enel exceeds the peer group in terms of capitalization, is above the ninth decile in terms of revenue and slightly below the ninth decile in terms of number of employees.\n\nThe same analysis also found that - against Enel's very high positioning compared with the companies included in the panel in terms of capitalization, revenue and number of employees - the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors and of the other Statutory Auditors is just under the peer group median for the Chairman and in line with the median for the other standing Statutory Auditors. The analysis also found that in 2020, on average, the boards of statutory auditors of the companies belonging to the panel were composed of  four standing auditors compared with the three standing members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors, and held 25  meetings compared with the 27 meetings held by Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors.\n\nOn the basis of the analysis, it therefore emerged that the competitiveness of the remuneration envisaged for the Chairman and the other standing members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors is similar to the positioning of the non-executive directors",

(net of attendance fees, which at Enel are not envisaged for participation in board meetings but are paid by some of the peer group companies used for the purpose of preparing the 2022 policy for directors' remuneration).\n\nHowever, the consultant noted that to correctly assess the appropriateness of the remuneration paid to the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors, it would be advisable to assess its amount in the light of the overall effort required by the position,  taking due consideration  of the fact that the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors also  participate in the meetings of the Board committees  (a practice that enables them to perform their oversight of the effective implementation of the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code  within Enel) without receiving any additional remuneration for this activity.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the benchmark analysis found a clear correlation\n\nbetween  the  competitiveness  of  the  remuneration  offered  by  the  peer  group companies to their respective boards of statutory auditors and the different work load required of them, as indicated by the number of meetings held in 2020. Accordingly, the analysis noted that companies in the financial services industry offer higher remuneration on average to the chairman and the standing members of their boards of statutory auditors, taking account of the greater number of meetings held. The analysis also found that the amount of remuneration paid to the Chairman and the standing members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors is substantially in line with that currently paid by the larger of the peer group companies in which the Ministry for the Economy and Finance holds a significant direct and/or indirect investment.\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors' oversight activity in 2021  was carried out in 28 meetings and with participation in the 16 meetings of the Board of Directors  and participation in the annual Shareholders' Meeting, and, through the chairman or one or more of its members, in the 17 meetings of the Control and Risk Committee (16 of which held jointly with the Board of Statutory Auditors), in the 12 meetings of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, in the 7 meetings of the Related Parties Committee and in the 5 meetings of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, for a total of 86 meetings. The delegated magistrate of the State Audit Court participated in the meetings of the Board of Statutory Auditors and those of the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the course of this activity and on the basis of information obtained from KPMG SpA, no omissions, censurable facts, irregularities or other significant developments were found that would require reporting to the regulatory authorities or mention in this report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through that date, Italian authorities maintained a number of limitations on freedom of movement within the country to contain the contagion, among other things imposing bans on gatherings.\n\nIn this context, the Board of Statutory Auditors, in the light of the measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, held many of its meetings in 2021 exclusively with the use of audio/video conference systems by all participants, which nevertheless ensured their identification and the exchange of documentation - in accordance with the provisions of Article 25.4 of the Bylaws - and, more generally, the full performance of the oversight body's functions.\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors also notes that the Company's Board of Directors has called the ordinary Shareholders' Meeting for May 19, 2022 in a single call, establishing that - in the light of the uncertain developments in the COVID-19 pandemic and taking account of the continuing need to reduce travel and the risks associated with in-person participation at events and considering the provisions concerning the holding of company meetings in Article 106, paragraph 4, of Decree Law 18 of March 17, 2020, ratified with amendments by Law 27 of April 24, 2020 (3) -  it will be conducted in a manner that enables shareholders to participate exclusively through the shareholders' representative designated by the Company referred to in Article 135-undecies of the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation, to whom shareholders may also confer proxies or subproxies pursuant to Article 135-novies of the Consolidated Law, also in derogation from the provisions of Article 135-undecies, paragraph 4, of the Consolidated Law. The Board of Statutory Auditors will ensure that the rights of the Shareholders can be exercised on the occasion of the aforementioned Shareholders' Meeting - as occurred on the occasion of the Enel Shareholders' Meetings held using similar procedures on May 14, 2020 and May 20, 2021 - within the limits permitted by the special procedures envisaged for holding the Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors will continue to carry out its oversight activity until the expiry of its term in close coordination with the Board of Directors and the audit firm to monitor the impact - including economic and financial repercussions - of the COVID-19 pandemic, and more recently the sensitive geopolitical situation, on the Company and the Enel Group.
