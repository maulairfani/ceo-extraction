Our Company is incorporated in Germany, with our corporate headquarters situated in Munich. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens had around /two.fitted/nine.fitted/three.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted employees.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens has the following reportable segments: Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers, which together form our 'Industrial Businesses' and Siemens Financial Services (SFS), which supports the activities of our industrial businesses and also conducts its own business with external customers. Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio Companies, which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance. During fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the energy business, consisting of the former reportable segment Gas and Power and the approximately /six.fitted/seven.fitted % stake held by Siemens in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S. A. (SGRE) - also a former reportable segment - was classified as held for disposal and discontinued operations. Siemens transferred the energy business into a new company, Siemens Energy AG, and in September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted listed it on the stock market via a spin-off. Siemens allocated /five.fitted/five.fitted./zero.fitted % of its ownership interest in Siemens Energy AG to its shareholders and a further /nine.fitted./nine.fitted % were transferred to Siemens Pension-Trust e. V. The remaining /three.fitted/five.fitted./one.fitted % of shares in Siemens Energy AG are held by Siemens and reported within Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements as Siemens Energy Investment. For further information, see NOTES /three.fitted and /four.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS . Also part of\n\nReconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements is Siemens Advanta, formerly Siemens IoT Services, a strategic advisor and implementation partner in digital transformation and industrial internet of things (IIoT).\n\nOur reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue. Such orders and revenue are eliminated on the Group level.\n\n## NON-FINANCIAL MATTERS OF THE GROUP AND SIEMENS AG\n\nSiemens has policies for environmental, employee and social matters, for the respect of human rights, and anticorruption and bribery matters, among others. Our business model is described in chapters A./one.fitted and A./three.fitted of this Combined Management Report. Reportable information that is necessary for an understanding of the development, performance, position and the impact of our activities on these matters is included in this Combined Management  Report,  in  particular  in  chapters A./three.fitted through A./seven.fitted . Forward-looking information, including risk disclosures, is presented in chapter A./eight.fitted . Chapter A./nine.fitted includes additional information that is required to be reported in the Combined Management Report related to the parent company Siemens AG. As supplementary information, amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements  and  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  of Siemens AG related to such non-financial matters, and additional explanations thereto, are included in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, NOTES /one.fitted/seven.fitted, /one.fitted/eight.fitted, /two.fitted/two.fitted, /two.fitted/six.fitted and /two.fitted/seven.fitted , and in the NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF SIEMENS AG FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, NOTES /one.fitted/six.fitted, /one.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/one.fitted and /two.fitted/five.fitted . In order to inform the users of the financial reports in a focused manner, these disclosures are not subject to a specific non-financial framework  - in contrast to the disclosures in our separate 'Sustainability Information /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted' document, which are based on the standards developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).",

Our primary measure for managing and controlling our revenue growth is comparable growth, because it shows the development in our business net of currency translation effects, which arise from the external environment outside of our control, and portfolio effects, which involve business activities which are either new to or no longer a part of the respective business.\n\nCurrency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition or a disposition and is calculated as the change year-over-year in revenue resulting specifically from the transaction. For calculating the percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. For orders, we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.\n\n## A.2.3  Profitability and   capital   efficiency\n\nWithin the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which are based on the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue. For our industrial businesses, profit represents EBITA adjusted for operating financial income (expenses), net, and amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations (Adjusted EBITA).\n\nWe have set the following margin ranges in our Siemens Financial Framework:\n\nMargin ranges\n\n| Digital Industries                         | 17 - 23 %   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Smart Infrastructure                       | 10 - 15 %   |\n| Mobility                                   | 9 - 12 %    |\n| Siemens Healthineers                       | 17 - 21 %   |\n| Industrial Businesses                      | 11 - 15 %   |\n| Siemens Financial Services (ROE after tax) | 17 - 22 %   |\n\nThe margin range for Siemens Healthineers reflects our expectation as a majority shareholder.",

        "page_content": "In line with common practice in the financial services business, our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at Siemens Financial Services is return on equity after tax, or ROE after tax. ROE is defined as Siemens Financial Services' profit after tax, divided by its average allocated equity.\n\nFor purposes of managing and controlling profitability at the Group level, we use net income as our primary measure. This measure is the main driver of basic earnings per share (EPS) from net income, which we used in communication to the capital markets in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nWe seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. For purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens Financial Framework. Our long-term goal is to achieve ROCE within a range of /one.fitted/five.fitted % to /two.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\n## A.2.4  Capital structure\n\nSustainable revenue and profit development is supported by a healthy capital structure. Accordingly, a key consideration within the Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations). This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be needed to cover Industrial net debt through income from continuing operations, without taking into account interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We aim to achieve a ratio of up to /one.fitted./zero.fitted.\n\n## A.2.5  Liquidity and dividend\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. Under the Siemens Financial Framework, our intention is to propose a dividend whose distribution volume is within a dividend payout range of /four.fitted/zero.fitted % to /six.fitted/zero.fitted % of Net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG, which we may adjust for this purpose to exclude selected exceptional non-cash effects. As in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow. To provide an assessment of our ability to generate cash, and ultimately to pay dividends, we use the cash conversion rate of Industrial Businesses, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow from Industrial Businesses to Adjusted EBITA Industrial Businesses. Because growth requires investments, we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of /one.fitted minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of Industrial Businesses.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, will submit the following proposal to allocate the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted: to distribute a dividend of \u20ac /three.fitted./five.fitted/zero.fitted on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted existing at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting; the remaining amount is to be carried forward. The dividend of \u20ac/three.fitted./five.fitted/zero.fitted consists of \u20ac /three.fitted./zero.fitted/zero.fitted at the upper end of our targeted dividend payout ratio, supplemented by an additional \u20ac /zero.fitted./five.fitted/zero.fitted. Payment of the proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by Siemens shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The prioryear  dividend was \u20ac /three.fitted./nine.fitted/zero.fitted per share.\n\nThe proposed dividend of \u20ac/three.fitted./five.fitted/zero.fitted per share for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted represents a total payout of \u20ac/two.fitted./eight.fitted billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Based on Net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG of  \u20ac/four.fitted./zero.fitted billion  for  fiscal  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the  dividend  payout percentage is /seven.fitted/zero.fitted%.",

        "page_content": "A./three.fitted\n\n## Segment information\n\n## A.3.1  Overall economic conditions\n\nThe macroeconomic development in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted was dominated by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted) and subsequent recession, which was the deepest since the Second World War. Global gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to contract by /four.fitted./five.fitted % in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, after it grew by /two.fitted./six.fitted % in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.\n\nGlobal economic activity was already decelerating in the first quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted as the trade conflict between the U. S. and China increasingly took its toll. Shortly after economic sentiment indicators improved in response to calming of the conflict (due to the 'phase one deal'), the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-/two.fitted) emerged and started to spread globally. Voluntary and mandated social distancing measures to contain the outbreak massively restricted economic activity, first in China, then in other Asian countries, the Middle East and Europe, and finally in the Americas and Africa. Sectors with high intensity of personal contact had to substantially curtail or stop their operations. Many other industries were directly affected by supply chain problems or indirectly by insufficient demand and also stopped production.\n\nGlobally, governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy measures, first, to ensure short-term liquidity of firms and households, later to stimulate their economies after the deep slump. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), these measures resulted in fiscal policy responses totaling US$ /one.fitted/two.fitted trillion and balance sheet expansion of nearly US$ /seven.fitted./five.fitted trillion on the part of central banks in the G/one.fitted/zero.fitted. As a result, and after initial lockdown measures were lifted while the virus outbreak slowed, the global economy experienced a strong rebound in the summer months of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. But a full recovery could not be achieved, due to renewed virus outbreaks and restrictions on contact-intensive industries ('/nine.fitted/zero.fitted % economy'). The only notable exception was the Chinese economy where the recovery has been much faster than expected\n\nand positive GDP growth (+ /one.fitted./nine.fitted %) is expected for calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. All other major economies are expected to record reductions in GDP in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted: European Union (EU) (/seven.fitted./seven.fitted) %, U. S. (/three.fitted./five.fitted) %, Japan (/five.fitted./six.fitted) %, India (/one.fitted/zero.fitted./eight.fitted) %. For advanced countries in aggregate, calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted GDP is expected to decline by /five.fitted./five.fitted %. For emerging countries, the decline in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted GDP is estimated at /three.fitted./one.fitted %.\n\nThe partly estimated figures presented here for GDP are based on an IHS Markit report dated October /one.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nThese economic developments also influenced Siemens' business performance in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, in particularly with regard to effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted. These effects varied between Siemens' businesses, customer markets and geographic regions. While some of our key customer industries such as automotive and machine building were heavily impacted by the steep drop in global GDP beginning in the second calendar quarter of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, other customer industries, such as semiconductors, electronics and data centers, accelerated in order to serve rapid global growth in online activity for work, leisure and retail consumption. While the pandemic significantly slowed our sales and service activities because of restricted access to customer sites, this also resulted in cost reductions such as lower travel and marketing expenses. Furthermore, we were able to keep our production largely stable due to the use of our own technology in our factories and our diversified value chain. On a geographic basis, China was both the first country significantly affected by COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted and the first major national economy to see a return to growth, which occurred towards the end of our fiscal year. In contrast, large parts of Europe and the Americas continue to be strongly impacted by COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, following temporary relief during the summer months from the pandemic's first waves in the spring. All these market dynamics noticeably affected volume and income of Siemens' businesses in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted as described below.",

        "page_content": "## A.3.2  Digital Industries\n\nDigital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries; these offerings include automation systems and software for factories, numerical control systems, motors, drives and inverters and integrated automation systems for machine tools and production machines. Digital Industries also provides process control systems, machine-to-machine communication products, sensors (for measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) and radio frequency identification systems. Furthermore, Digital Industries offers production and product lifecycle management software, and software for simulation and testing of mechatronic systems. These leading software offerings are integrated with the electronic design automation (EDA) software portfolio of Mentor Graphics (Mentor) and the open, cloud-based industrial internet of things (IIoT) operating system MindSphere, which connects machines and physical infrastructure to the digital world. These offerings are complemented by Mendix' cloud-native low-code application development platform, which allows customers to significantly reduce app development times through visual representation of underlying code. Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and data-driven services. Taken together, Digital Industries' offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development through production and post-sale services. With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in the discrete manufacturing, hybrid and process industries in their evolution towards the 'Digital Enterprise,' resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to market for new products. The most important markets include the automotive industry, the machine building industry, the pharmaceutical and chemicals industry, the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry. Digital Industries serves its customers  through  a  common  regional  sales  organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in\n\nDigital Industries' profitability. Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for Mentor, may also result in strong fluctuations in quarterly volume and profitability. Competition for Digital Industries' business activities comes primarily from multinational corporations that offer a relatively broad portfolio and from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.\n\nDigital Industries sees three trends influencing its business and providing long-term growth opportunities. Producers of investment goods in today's increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity, particularly to increase production flexibility and reduce time to market. This environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service offerings, which their customers either need or want in order to take full advantage of the investment goods. Finally, there is a trend from globalization to regionalization, to support local economic development or to better adapt solutions to local needs.\n\nResearch & Development  (R & D) activities at Digital Industries are aimed at integrating technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), edge computing, cloud technologies, additive manufacturing and industrial /five.fittedG wireless technology into Digital Industries' extensive portfolio for industrial automation and digitalization. Beyond its own R & D activities, Digital Industries collaborates closely with partners and customers. An example is PlantSight, jointly developed by Digital Industries and Bentley Systems, Inc. (Bentley), which utilizes real-time analytics and AI to generate new insights and enable real-time collaboration between engineering, operations and maintenance functions. With its new NX Sketch software tool for computer-aided design (CAD), Digital Industries has advanced CAD sketching by using AI to infer relationships on the fly so that users can move away from a paper hand sketch and truly create conceptual designs in the NX environment. In the field of AI-based services, Digital Industries launched 'Predictive Services for Foundry,' which enables users to increase overall plant efficiency in the automotive sector. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Digital Industries also launched 'Siemens Industrial Edge,' which brings edge computing and intelligent analytics to manufacturing automation devices and introduced new software as",

In addition to this, Digital Industries launched the SIMATIC IOT/two.fitted/zero.fitted/five.fitted/zero.fitted gateway, which links cloud computing with in-company IT and production. Digital Industries further expanded its portfolio and partnerships for industrialized additive manufacturing. With NX AM Path Optimizer, a new technology integrated in NX software, Digital Industries demonstrated how to locally adapt and optimize the printing process during production planning. Together with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., Digital Industries implemented the first private /five.fittedG standalone network in a real-world industrial environment using the /three.fitted./seven.fitted-/three.fitted./eight.fittedGHz band. By launching Xcelerator, Digital Industries is now offering an integrated portfolio of software, services and application development capabilities that can be adapted to fit customer and industry-specific needs and thereby help companies of all sizes become digital enterprises.

While the software business achieved significant order growth, including a number of large contract wins, most notably in its EDA software business, orders in the automation businesses declined due to lower demand from some of their most important customer segments, particularly the automotive and the machine building industries. This latter development was a significant factor in lower orders for the region comprising Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States (C. I. S.), Africa, Middle East, including a double-\n\ndigit decrease in Germany. In contrast, orders rose in the Americas and Asia, Australia regions, including significant growth in the U. S. and China. Revenue was similarly affected by declines in the automation businesses, particularly in the short-cycle motion control and factory automation businesses. The software business achieved moderate revenue growth. On a geographic basis, the region Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East posted a significant revenue decline while Asia, Australia and the Americas delivered revenue close to the prior-year levels. Adjusted EBITA rose due mainly to a \u20ac /seven.fitted/six.fitted/seven.fitted million positive effect related to Digital Industries' stake in Bentley Systems, Inc. (Bentley), which was mostly from revaluation following that company's public listing in September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and included \u20ac /four.fitted/eight.fitted million in dividend payments for the full year. Adjusted EBITA rose substantially in the software business. A year earlier, the software business benefited from a \u20ac /five.fitted/zero.fitted million gain from the sale of an equity investment. Adjusted EBITA and profitability decreased in the auto mation businesses, due largely to revenue declines associated with COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted; this development was only partially offset by cost savings from pandemic restrictions such as lower travel and marketing expenses. Severance charges, primarily related to cost structure improvements, were \u20ac /two.fitted/one.fitted/zero.fitted million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, up from severance charges of \u20ac /nine.fitted/two.fitted million a year earlier. Digital Industries' order backlog was \u20ac /five.fitted billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac /four.fitted billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nDigital Industries achieved its results in a market environment which, beginning with the second quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, was strongly impacted by effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, resulting in considerably lower demand for investment goods. The magnitude and duration of pandemic impacts varied across regions and market segments. Market volume in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted declined clearly in the region comprising Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East and to a lesser extent in the Americas. In contrast, market volume in Asia, Australia slightly grew year-over-year. Within that region, China, which was hit first by the pandemic, was among the first countries that saw a recovery towards the end of the fiscal year. Within the most important industries served by Digital Industries, the auto motive industry, which already was in a downturn a year earlier, severely cut production in response to the",

The production cuts in the automotive industry were also a main factor for a massive decline in demand in the machine building industry. The food and beverage markets declined moderately due to weak demand for beverages. The chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry was less impacted by the pandemic, due mainly to stable production levels in the pharmaceuticals industry. The global electronics and semiconductor markets kept growing during fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. While the forecast for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted indicates a slight recovery of the markets served by Digital Industries, including moderate expansion in manufacturing investments, pre-pandemic market volume is not expected to be reached in the next fiscal year.\n\nIn October /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the stake in Bentley was transferred to Corporate items, reported within the Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements. In November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, to further strengthen Siemens' pension assets and safeguards the post-employment benefits of employees, Siemens transferred the stake in Bentley from Corporate items to Siemens Pension-Trust e. V.\n\n## A.3.3  Smart Infrastructure\n\nSmart Infrastructure supplies and intelligently connects energy systems and building technologies, to significantly improve efficiency and sustainability of public and private infrastructures, while supporting its customers in addressing major technology shifts. Smart Infrastructure delivers these benefits with a range of products and systems for intelligent grid control, low- and medium voltage electrification and control products, building automation, fire safety and security and energy efficiency in buildings. At the grid edge - the interface between energy grids and buildings and energy consumers - Smart Infrastructure serves high-growth markets in distributed energy systems, electric vehicle infrastructure, microgrids and energy trading. Beginning with fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the distribution transformer business was transferred to the former segment Gas and Power. Smart Infrastructure serves its customers through a broad range of channels, including its global product and systems sales organization, distributors, panel builders, original equipment\n\nmanufacturers (OEM) and value added resellers and installers, all complemented by direct sales through the branch offices of its regional solutions and services units worldwide. Smart Infrastructure's customer base is diverse. It encompasses infrastructure developers, construction companies and contractors; owners, operators and tenants of both public and commercial buildings including hospitals, campuses, airports and data centers; utilities and power distribution network operators; companies in heavy industries such as oil and gas, mining and chemicals; and companies in discrete manufacturing industries such as automotive and machine building. Smart Infrastructure's principal competitors consist mainly of large multinational companies and smaller manufacturers in emerging countries. Its solutions and services business also competes with local players such as system integrators and facility management firms. Smart Infrastructure's businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment to varying degrees, depending on customer segment. While customer demand in discrete manufacturing industries changes quickly and strongly with macroeconomic cycles, it reacts more slowly in infrastructure, construction, heavy industries and the utilities sector. Particularly in its solutions and service business, Smart Infrastructure is affected by changes in the non-residential building construction markets with a time lag of two to four quarters. Overall, Smart Infrastructure has developed a balanced and resilient business mix with its diversified regional and vertical markets; its range of products, systems, solutions and services; and its participation in both long- and shortcycle markets.\n\nThe markets served are experiencing shifts that present opportunities where building technologies and electrification meet. Key trends include climate change, rising population and urbanization which increase the need for safe, secure and sustainable environments that provide interactive, comfortable spaces and affordable costs for energy, operation and maintenance. These trends lead to cross-sector coupling of previously separate technologies, such as electrification of heat and transportation to optimize energy efficiency. Decarbonization is changing the energy generation mix towards renewable energy sources, which fluctuate with time of day and weather conditions. As a result, the energy system is becoming",

Both smarter buildings and the integration of more distributed energy sources into conventional power networks result in increasing technological and management complexity, including rising volumes of data, bi-directional energy and information flows. These can be reliably managed only through digitalization of buildings, transportation and energy systems.\n\nSmart Infrastructure's R & D activities focus on the one hand on addressing the trends of decentralization, decarbonization and digitalization of energy markets. On the other hand, R & D expenses strengthen Smart Infrastructure's capabilities to create comfortable, safe and energyefficient buildings and infrastructures that support increased efficiency of occupants, equipment and the use of building space. Smart Infrastructure is expanding its digital offerings in its existing businesses while integrating recent acquisitions in such critical areas as power control systems, power electronics and building IoT. Furthermore, it develops technologies for environmentally friendly and increasingly renewable energy systems, ranging from photovoltaic inverter technology to battery storage and charging solutions for e-mobility. In this regard, data from field devices is the basis to intelligently deliver grid flexibility and continuously match energy supply and demand while protecting grid assets. For electrical distribution systems and industrial plants, Smart Infrastructure continuously drives digitalization of its switching and control products with built-in intelligence, connectivity to the cloud, and increasingly remote diagnostics and edge computing capability. Its digital twins of products, building systems or grids deliver customer value with online configuration tools, maintenance and service management. Smart Infrastructure also develops data-driven applications and digital services. To a large extent, its capital expenditures relate to the products businesses. Main investment areas are replacement of fixed assets and further digitalization of factories and technical equipment, with a strong focus on innovation.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)           | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted   | Fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   | Actual   | % Change Comp.   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Orders                       | 14,734                                           | 15,590                                                       | (5) %    | (5) %            |\n| Revenue                      | 14,323                                           | 14,597                                                       | (2) %    | (2) %            |\n| therein:  products  business | 5,224                                            | 5,515                                                        | (5) %    | (5) %            |\n| Adjusted EBITA               | 1,302                                            | 1,465                                                        | (11) %   |                  |\n| Adjusted EBITA   margin      | 9.1 %                                            | 10.0 %                                                       |          |                  |\n\nThe decline in orders at Smart Infrastructure primarily involves the solutions and services business, which took in a sharply higher volume from large orders a year earlier. Orders in the products business decreased only moderately year-over-year, despite an adverse market environ ment for the short-cycle activities at the beginning of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted that rapidly became significantly worse due to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted. The systems and software business was able to keep orders close to the prior-year level. Weakness in short-cycle markets also strongly impacted revenue development in the products business. Revenue for the solutions and services business and for the systems and software business remained close to the prioryear levels. On a geographic basis, the decline in orders and revenue was due to the regions Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East and Asia, Australia, while volume in the Americas remained largely stable. Adjusted EBITA declined across the businesses and was impacted by severance charges of \u20ac /one.fitted/nine.fitted/five.fitted million associated with the execution of Smart Infrastructure's competitiveness program, up from severance charges of \u20ac /four.fitted/six.fitted million a year earlier. Impacts on Adjusted EBITA and profitability related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted were partly offset by expense reductions resulting from pandemic restrictions. Adjusted EBITA in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted benefited from a \u20ac /one.fitted/five.fitted/nine.fitted million gain from the sale of a business while the prior fiscal year included negative effects related to grid control projects. Smart Infrastructure's order backlog was \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac /seven.fitted billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nDemand in the markets served by Smart Infrastructure declined moderately in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted due primarily to effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, which impacted most key customer industries and all reporting regions.

Grid markets remained relatively stable, as utilities continued to prioritize investment in making legacy networks more automated, intelligent, flexible and reliable. Despite a moderate decline in demand in the construction market overall, the important segment of that market for Smart Infrastructure - energy performance services - continued to grow, benefiting from persistent demand for energy efficiency and digital services. The data center market grew clearly, supported by higher demand for remote working and cloud services. On a geographic basis, European markets were most strongly impacted by effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, followed by the markets in the Asia, Australia region, while impacts on the U. S. markets were less severe. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, utilities markets are expected to grow moderately and industry markets are forecast to recover slightly. However, market development overall is expected to be impacted by lower demand from the building construction sector, leading to an overall slight decline in volume of markets served by Smart Infrastructure year-over-year. On a geographic basis, markets in Asia, Australia are expected to return to their growth path with some of the region's countries already reaching pre-pandemic market volume. Markets in Europe overall are expected to remain on the reduced level and within the Americas, market volume in the U.

It also provides its customers with consulting, planning, financing, construction, service and operation of turnkey mobility systems. Moreover, Mobility offers integrated mobility solutions for networking of different types of traffic systems. It sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and stateowned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. Customers usually have multi-year planning and\n\nimplementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short-term economic trends. Mobility's principal competitors are multinational companies. Consolidation among Mobility's competitors is continuing: In May /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotives Co., Ltd., China (CRRC) finalized the acquisition of Vossloh Locomotives GmbH, Germany to gain a foothold in Europe, in line with CRRC's ambitious growth and internationalization strategy. In September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Alstom SA of France (Alstom) signed the sale and purchase agreement for the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation. Already in July /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the European Commission  decided  to  grant  conditional  clearance  of  the proposed acquisition. The closing of the transaction is expected for the first quarter of calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. While CRRC retains its place as the largest rolling stock manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue, the planned acquisition of Bombardier Transportation by Alstom will create the second-largest rolling stock manufacturer worldwide. Market consolidation may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail supply industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.\n\nThe main trends driving Mobility's markets are urbanization and the need to reduce emissions. Increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable. At the same time, cities and national economies face the challenge of cutting CO /two.fitted and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation. The pressure on mobility providers to meet all these needs is expected to rise continuously.\n\nMobility's R & D strategy is focused on making trains and infrastructures more intelligent, thereby increasing its customers' return on investment, improving passenger experience, and guaranteeing availability. Decarbonization and seamlessly connected (e-)mobility are key factors for the future of transportation. Mobility's major R & D areas include the development of efficient vehicle platforms with optimized lifecycle cost and maximum customization flexibility; eco-friendly, alternative power supplies for trains (batteries, fuel cells, dual mode) and trucks (eHighway); digital services for railways via its Railigent application suite; 'signaling in the cloud,' a",

Those important orders in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted included a \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion contract for high-speed trains; orders for the commuter rail platform Mireo, such as a first order for battery-powered trains including a long-term service agreement; a first order of /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted dual-power locomotives out of a framework agreement comprising up to /four.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted vehicles, all in Germany; and an order for signaling infrastructure in Singapore. Revenue rose on clear growth in the rolling stock business, which executed strongly on its large order backlog, and in the customer services business. These increases were partly offset by lower revenue in the rail infrastructure business. Volume development in the rail infrastructure and the customer services businesses was impacted by effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, including restricted access to customer sites and lower operating mileage on public transport. On a geographic basis, revenue rose in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East, due particularly to a significant growth contribution from Germany, and in the Americas. This growth was partly offset by a double-digit decline in revenue in Asia, Australia. Adjusted EBITA and profitability declined due to a less favorable revenue mix year-over-year, including a lower share from the higher-margin rail infrastructure business and expenses related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted for internal\n\nmeasures to safeguard employee health in manufacturing facilities. Severance charges were \u20ac /two.fitted/zero.fitted million in both fiscal years under review. Mobility's order backlog was \u20ac /three.fitted/two.fitted  billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac /eight.fitted  billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nWhile the long-term demand for efficient and environmentally friendly public transport continues to be a growth driver for the markets served by Mobility, order development in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted partly reflected the postponement of large rail and infrastructure projects due to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, which led to a temporary decline in market volume, particularly in Europe. Despite these postponements, market development in Europe continued to be characterized by awards of mid-size to large orders, particularly in Germany, France and in the U. K. Demand in the Middle East and Africa was held back by ongoing uncertainties related to budget constraints and political climates. In the Americas region, investment activities were driven by demand for urban and mainline transport, especially in the U. S. and Canada. Within the Asia, Australia region, Chinese markets saw ongoing investments in high-speed trains, urban transport, freight logistics and rail infrastructure, while India continues to invest in modernizing the country's transportation infrastructure. We expect these main regional investment trends to continue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Furthermore, we expect market volume in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted to exceed the pre-pandemic level due in part to fiscal stimulus that benefits rail and public transport operators across various countries. Overall, rail transport and intermodal mobility solutions are expected to remain a focus as urbanization continues to progress around the world. In emerging countries, rising incomes are expected to result in greater demand for public transport solutions.",

Siemens Healthineers is a global provider of healthcare solutions and services. It develops, manufactures, and sells a diverse range of innovative imaging, diagnostic and advanced therapies products and services to healthcare providers. In addition, it also provides clinical consulting services, complemented by an extensive range of training and service offerings. This comprehensive portfolio supports customers all along the care continuum, from prevention and early detection to diagnosis, treatment, and followup care. The customer spectrum ranges from public and private healthcare providers, including hospitals and hospital systems, public and private clinics and laboratories, universities, physicians / physician groups, public health agencies, state-run and private health insurers, to pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes. In its imaging business, the most important products are equipment for magnetic resonance, computed tomography, X-ray systems, molecular imaging, and ultrasound. Its diagnostics business offers in-vitro diagnostic products and services to healthcare providers in laboratory, molecular and point-of-care diagnostics. The products in its advanced therapies business facilitate image-guided minimally invasive treatments, in areas such as cardiology, interventional radiology, surgery and radiation oncology. In October /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Siemens Healthineers acquired Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc., USA, (Corindus) for US$ /one.fitted./one.fitted billion (\u20ac /one.fitted./zero.fitted billion) in cash. Corindus develops and provides a robotic-assisted platform for endo-vascular coronary and peripheral vascular interventions and was integrated in the advanced therapies business. In September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens Healthineers AG placed /seven.fitted/five.fitted million new shares to institutional investors. Siemens did not participate in the placement, thus, Siemens' stake in Siemens Healthineers decreased from /eight.fitted/five.fitted % to /seven.fitted/nine.fitted %. Competition in the imaging and advanced therapies businesses consists mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, while the diagnostics market is fragmented with a variety of global players that compete with each other across market segments and also with several regional players and specialized companies in niche technologies. The business activities of Siemens\n\nHealthineers are to a certain extent resilient to shortterm economic trends because large portions of its revenue stem from recurring business. They are, however, directly and indirectly dependent on trends in healthcare markets and on developments in health policy, and geopolitical developments around the world.\n\nThe addressable markets of Siemens Healthineers are shaped by four major trends. The first is demographic, in particular the growing and aging global population. This trend poses major challenges for global healthcare systems and, at the same time, offers opportunities as the demand for cost-efficient healthcare solutions continues to intensify. The second trend is economic development in emerging countries, which opens up improved access to healthcare for many people. As the middle class continues to grow, significant investment in the expansion of private and public healthcare systems will persist, driving overall demand for healthcare products and services and hence market growth. The third trend is the increase in chronic diseases as a consequence of an aging population and environmental and lifestyle-related changes. This development creates additional pressure on health systems and leads to increased costs to address it. The fourth global trend, the transformation of healthcare providers, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. Increasing cost pressure on the healthcare sector is prompting the introduction of new remuneration models for healthcare services, such as value-based rather than treatment-based reimbursement. Digitalization and artificial intelligence are likely to be key enablers for healthcare providers as they increasingly focus on enhancing the overall patient experience, with better outcomes and overall reduction in cost of care. This development is driven partly by society's increasing resistance to healthcare costs, payers' increasing professionalization, burdens from chronic disease and rapid scientific progress. As a result, healthcare providers are consolidating into networked structures, resulting in larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally, which act increasingly like large corporations. Applying this industrial logic to the healthcare market can lead to systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs. Driven by the need of healthcare systems worldwide to deliver better",

Most developed countries are currently considering regulatory changes within their healthcare systems.\n\nR & D activities at Siemens Healthineers are ultimately geared towards delivering innovative, sustainable solutions to its customers while safeguarding and improving its competitiveness. Particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, it has further expanded its activities and has more than /six.fitted/five.fitted products and applications on the market that further improve its customers' productivity, while enabling clinical decisions to be more precise and tailored to the individual patient. Artificial intelligencebased technology will, starting in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, also be used in sample handling and classification in its Atellica Solution  laboratory  system.  Furthermore,  Siemens Healthi neers is continuously expanding its portfolio of digital services to support customers in their transition to value-based care. The teamplay digital health platform brings together data, applications and services to make better decisions for  patients in an efficient way. In addition  to  continually  updating  its  portfolio,  Siemens Healthineers also improves existing products and solutions. Siemens Healthineers focuses its investments mainly on enhancing competitiveness and innovation. The main capital expenditures were for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities, in particular in China and the U. S., and for additions to intangible assets, including  capitalized development expenses within the Atellica Solution and Blood Gas product lines.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)    | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted   | Fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   | Actual   | % Change Comp.   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Orders                | 16,163                                           | 15,853                                                       | 2 %      | 3 %              |\n| Revenue               | 14,460                                           | 14,517                                                       | 0 %      | 0 %              |\n| Adjusted EBITA        | 2,184                                            | 2,461                                                        | (11) %   |                  |\n| Adjusted EBITA margin | 15.1 %                                           | 17.0 %                                                       |          |                  |\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, orders grew slightly on increases in the diagnostics and imaging business, partly offset by a decline in the advanced therapies business. On a regional\n\nbasis, orders were up in the Americas and in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East, while order intake in the Asia, Australia region was near the prior-year level. For revenue, slight increases in the imaging and advanced therapies businesses were offset by a moderate decline in the diagnostics business. On a regional basis, moderate growth in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East was offset by slight decreases in the Americas and Asia, Australia. Adjusted EBITA was down year-over-year, mainly due to the diagnostics business where COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted led to lower volume from testing for routine care and higher costs, and where costs rose also related to Atellica Solution. Adjusted EBITA was down slightly in the advanced therapies business. In contrast, the imaging business again posted strong results, which were higher than in the prior year. Severance charges were \u20ac /six.fitted/five.fitted million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and \u20ac /five.fitted/seven.fitted million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. The order backlog for Siemens Healthineers was \u20ac /one.fitted/eight.fitted billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which \u20ac /six.fitted billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the markets of Siemens Healthineers were impacted by COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted. Overall, the long-term market trends remained intact, however the pandemic reinforced some of them. For example, the already increasing cost pressure for health systems and customers rose to unprecedented levels. For the markets addressed by the imaging business, Siemens Healthineers saw a slight market decrease. Significant market declines in major modalities such as magnetic resonance systems were balanced out by an increased interest in equipment and solutions used to diagnose and treat COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, leading to moderate  to  significant  growth  of  these  markets. Siemens Healthineers expects that a recovery will not be achieved before the end of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. For the diagnostics business, markets increased for point-of-care tests to monitor patients and lab tests to detect SARS-CoV-/two.fitted and identify antibodies, while at the same time the demand for certain diagnostic reagents, particularly tests for routine care, was reduced as patient volume decreased. The development of the diagnostics market depends on a number of factors related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, including development of a vaccine, additional waves of infection, and potential pent-up demand for routine testing. SARSCoV-/two.fitted tests are expected to drive a market growth surge in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The market for the advanced therapies",

Given that hospitals had to free up capacities and resources for potential COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted emergencies, the number of routine and elective procedures severely decreased. It is expected to fully recover only after the end of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. On a regional basis, public investment programs in selected countries as well as increased demand related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted in several major countries drove market growth for the imaging and advanced therapies businesses in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East. This counterbalanced negative effects due to country lockdowns, resulting in clear to significant overall market growth in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted in those markets. Clear market growth for the diagnostics business in that region was driven by test programs for SARS-CoV-/two.fitted. For the U. S. market, project postponements or cessation and limited access to healthcare providers due to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic and related lockdowns resulted in significant market  declines  across  all  imaging  and  advanced therapies markets. The continued rise in COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted cases increased the U. S. diagnostics market growth on clear levels,  as  demand  for  molecular  and  point-of-care COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted tests further increased. In China, the most important market for Siemens Healthineers in the Asia, Australia region, lockdowns and postponed or cancelled elective procedures led to clear declines in the market for the advanced therapies business. In contrast, public investments in selected provinces with a high number of COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted cases drove significant market growth in the imaging business. The growing private market segment was more burdened by the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted crisis, leading to a slower recovery and potential consolidation within that segment. Although diagnostic tests were widely applied to identify SARS-CoV-/two.fitted, including large scale testing of whole populations of certain regions, this additional demand could not counterbalance the downturn of routine  testing,  resulting  in  an  overall  significant decrease in the diagnostics market.\n\nThe planned acquisition of Varian Medical Systems, Inc., U. S. (Varian), announced in August /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, will add an additional business within Siemens Healthineers. It addresses the field of cancer care and provides innovative solutions in radiation oncology and related software.\n\n## A.3.6  Siemens Financial Services\n\nSiemens Financial Services (SFS) supports its customers' investments with leasing solutions and equipment, project and structured financing in the form of debt and equity investments.

From the beginning of calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, SFS addressed continuing high uncertainty in its markets, including effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, resulting in a sharp increase of credit risk provisions in the debt business compared to fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. Results in the equity business came in significantly lower compared to fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the main factor being a loss of \u20ac /nine.fitted/eight.fitted million from an impairment of an equity investment in the U. S. The decrease in total assets since the end of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted is due mainly to negative currency translation effects.\n\nNet cash from operations (defined as the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities) amounted to \u20ac(/two.fitted/eight.fitted/four.fitted) million compared to \u20ac(/seven.fitted/eight.fitted/two.fitted) million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.

Unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal re-organization, digitalization, cost improvements, and optimizing procurement, production and service activities. After achieving certain threshold performance targets, businesses may be transferred to one of Siemens industrial businesses, combined with an external business from the same industry, spun off via public listing, or placed into an external private equity partnership.\n\nBeginning with fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the equity investments Ethos Energy Group Limited and Voith Hydro Holding GmbH & Co. KG, the subsea business, and the majority of the process solutions business were transferred to the former Gas and Power segment and during the second quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted Siemens' stake in Primetals Technologies Limited was sold.\n\nAfter these changes Portfolio Companies included at the end of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted mainly the following fully consolidated units, which are managed separately: gear units and couplings (Mechanical Drives) and generators for wind turbines (Wind Energy Generation), which were combined at the end of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted within the company Flender; electric motors, converters and generators (Large Drives Applications); sorting technology and solutions for mail, parcel, baggage and cargo handling (Siemens Logistics); and certain regional remaining business activities of the former Gas and Power segment (Siemens Energy Assets), which were not carved out\n\nto Siemens Energy due to country-specific regulatory restrictions or economic considerations. Siemens Energy Assets were classified to Portfolio Companies during the second quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Portfolio Companies also holds an at-equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH.\n\nWith certain notable exceptions, demand within the industries served by Portfolio Companies generally shows a delayed response to changes in the overall economic environment. The results of fully consolidated units are strongly dependent, however, on customer investment cycles in their key industries. In commodity-based industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. The broad range of fully consolidated units and their aggregate, heterogonous industrial customer base is reflected in its sales and marketing channels. For example, the large drives applications business leverages the shared regional sales organization employed by Siemens industrial businesses, while other businesses require a dedicated sales approach based on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requirements.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)      | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted   | Fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   | Actual   | % Change Comp.   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Orders                  | 5,258                                            | 5,562                                                        | (5) %    | (4) %            |\n| Revenue                 | 5,393                                            | 5,455                                                        | (1) %    | 0 %              |\n| Adjusted EBITA          | (504)                                            | 2                                                            | n / a    |                  |\n| Adjusted EBITA   margin | (9.3) %                                          | 0.0 %                                                        |          |                  |\n\nVolume development was held back by impacts related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted and the development of the oil-price.

While Siemens Healthineers posted slight growth, order intake in Digital Industries was close to the prior-year level and down clearly in Smart Infrastructure. The decrease in emerging markets was due mainly to lower order intake in Russia, which in the prior year had included a \u20ac /one.fitted./two.fitted billion contract for high-speed trains including maintenance at Mobility.\n\nIn the Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East region, order intake was down significantly year-over-year due mainly to a lower volume from large orders in Mobility, which won several large contracts in the prior year, and clear declines in Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries that were only partly offset by a moderate increase in Siemens Healthineers. In contrast to the region overall, orders were up clearly in Germany, driven by sharp growth in Mobility which won several large contracts in the year under review, among them a \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion order for high-speed trains and a \u20ac /zero.fitted./three.fitted billion order for regional trains. Siemens Healthineers posted clear growth in Germany year-over-year, while order intake declined in Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries.",

Order intake for Smart Infrastructure was slightly below the prior-year level. The pattern of order development in the U. S. was largely the same as for the Americas region.\n\nIn the Asia, Australia region, orders overall rose slightly due to clear growth in Digital Industries, partly offset by a decrease in Smart Infrastructure. Order growth for Digital  Industries  was  particularly  strong  in  China.

Smart Infrastructure posted a slight decline, also involving short-cycle businesses, while revenue in Siemens Healthineers came in close to the prior-year level. In contrast, Mobility posted slight revenue growth due mainly to increases in its rolling stock business. The revenue decline in emerging markets was due mainly to lower revenue in countries that were strongly affected by the pandemic, in particular India.\n\nRevenue in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East decreased moderately as a significant decline in Digital Industries and a slight decrease in Smart Infrastructure were only partly offset by moderate growth in Mobility and Siemens Healthineers. In Germany, revenue was down only slightly with a decline in Digital Industries to a large degree offset by growth in Mobility.\n\nIn the Americas, revenue came in close to the prior-year level, as Mobility recorded clear growth that was offset by decreases in Siemens Healthineers and Digital Industries. In the U. S., year-over-year changes in revenue were small for all industrial businesses.\n\nRevenue in Asia, Australia declined moderately yearover-year on decreases in all four industrial businesses due mainly to the above-mentioned pandemic effect in India. In contrast, revenue in China was up moderately on growth in all industrial businesses except for Mobility.",

Severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac /five.fitted/nine.fitted/one.fitted million, of which \u20ac /four.fitted/nine.fitted/zero.fitted million were in Industrial Businesses. Adjusted EBITA margin Industrial Businesses excluding severance charges was /one.fitted/five.fitted./two.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, severance charges for continuing operations were \u20ac /three.fitted/four.fitted/zero.fitted million, of which \u20ac /two.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted million were in Industrial Businesses.\n\nThe tax rate of /two.fitted/four.fitted % for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted was below the tax rate of /two.fitted/six.fitted % for the prior year, benefiting from largely tax-free gains associated with the revaluation of the Bentley investment and with the transfer of investments to Siemens Pension-Trust e. V., and from a positive effect related to a retroactive statutory tax rate reduction; these factors were partly offset by impairment losses, which were not tax-deductible. As a result, the decline in Income from continuing operations was /one.fitted/seven.fitted %.\n\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income  taxes in both years predominantly included income related to Siemens Energy.\n\nIn May /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Siemens announced its intention to transfer the energy business into a new company, Siemens Energy AG, and list it on the stock market via a spin-off. Siemens Energy, or the distribution group, includes the former reportable segment Gas and Power and Siemens' /six.fitted /seven.fitted % stake in SGRE., /eight.fitted./one.fitted % of which was purchased in February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted from Iberdrola S. A. for a purchase price of \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion. The criteria for classification of the distribution group as held for disposal and discontinued operations were met at the end of the second quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, results and cash flows of the distribution group are reported as discontinued operations on a comparable basis for all periods presented. Effective with Siemens classifying the distribution group as held for disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets within the distribution group ceased. The spin-off was completed on September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. After the spin-off, Siemens Energy was deconsolidated; the remaining minority stake that Siemens holds in Siemens Energy is accounted for using the equity method.",

        "page_content": "The negative swing year-over-year was due primarily to losses at Gas and Power and SGRE, both of which had recorded positive earnings in the prior year, and income tax expenses of \u20ac /two.fitted/nine.fitted/eight.fitted million mainly related to the carveout of the distribution group, partly offset by a pretax gain of \u20ac /nine.fitted/four.fitted/six.fitted million, net of related expenses, from the spin-off.\n\nThe decline in basic earnings per share reflects the decrease of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was \u20ac /four.fitted,/zero.fitted/three.fitted/zero.fitted million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted compared to \u20ac /five.fitted,/one.fitted/seven.fitted/four.fitted million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, partially offset by a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nAs expected, ROCE at /seven.fitted./eight.fitted % was below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework. The decline yearover-year was due both to lower income before interest after tax and to higher average capital employed, which increased due mainly to effects from the adoption of IFRS /one.fitted/six.fitted, Leases, and acquisitions during the fiscal year, including Corindus at Siemens Healthineers.\n\n## A.4.3  Research and development\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we reported research and development (R & D) expenses of \u20ac /four.fitted./six.fitted billion, compared to \u20ac /four.fitted./seven.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. The resulting R & D intensity, defined as the ratio of R & D expenses and revenue, was /eight.fitted./one.fitted % (fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted: /eight.fitted./zero.fitted %). Additions to capitalized development expenses amounted to \u20ac /zero.fitted./four.fitted billion as in prior year. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Siemens held approximately /four.fitted/two.fitted,/nine.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted and /four.fitted/two.fitted,/four.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted respectively, granted patents worldwide in its continuing operations. On average, we had /four.fitted/zero.fitted,/eight.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted R & D employees in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nOur research and development activities are ultimately geared to developing innovative, sustainable solutions for our customers - and the Siemens businesses - while also strengthening our own competitiveness. Joint implementation by the operating units and Corporate Technology, our central R & D department, ensures that research activities and business strategies are closely aligned with one another, and that all units benefit equally and quickly from technological developments. As in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted the following technologies were the focus in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted: additive manufacturing, autonomous robotics, blockchain applications, connected (e-)mobility, connectivity and edge devices, cyber security, data analytics and artificial intelligence, distributed energy systems, energy storage, future of automation, materials, power electronics, simulation and digital twins, and software systems and processes.\n\nWe further develop technologies through our 'open innovation' concept. We are working closely with scholars from leading universities and research institutions, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects. Our focus here is on our strategic research partners, and especially the eight Centers of Knowledge Interchange that we maintain at leading universities worldwide.\n\nSiemens' global venture capital unit, Next/four.fitted/seven.fitted, provides capital to help start-ups expand and scale. It serves as the creator of next-generation businesses for Siemens by building, buying and partnering with innovative companies at any stage. Next/four.fitted/seven.fitted is focused on anticipating how emerging technologies will influence our end markets. This foreknowledge enables Siemens and our customers to grow and thrive in the age of digitalization.",

S. dollar.\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the spin-off of Siemens Energy was the major factor related to the decrease of Siemens' assets, mainly trade and other receivables, contract assets, inventories,  goodwill and other intangible assets. This was partly offset by goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from Siemens Healthineers' acquisitions of Corindus and ECG Management Consultants, U. S. (ECG). For further information see NOTE /three.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES  TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS . While the spin-off also reduced property, plant and equipment, this was partly offset  by  assets  recognized  in  connection  with  the adoption of IFRS /one.fitted/six.fitted, Leases. For further information see NOTE /two.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS .\n\nThe remaining minority stake that Siemens holds in Siemens Energy AG after the spin-off increased investments accounted for using the equity method by \u20ac /six.fitted./six.fitted billion.\n\nThe major factor for the decrease in other current financial assets was a reassessment of the expected repayment dates of loans receivable at SFS. This decrease was partly offset by receivables related to customer contracts in connection with the Siemens Energy activities legally remaining at Siemens. The reassessment of the expected repayment dates of loans receivable mentioned above was  also  the  main  factor  for  the  increase  in  other financial  assets, along with revaluation of Siemens' stake in Bentley.",

While the spin-off resulted also in decreased provisions for pensions and similar obligations, the major impact there resulted from extraordinary fundings in Germany, including the transfer of a /nine.fitted./nine.fitted % interest in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens  Pension Trust e. V.\n\nThe increase in short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt was due mainly to reclassifications of long-term euro instruments totaling \u20ac /three.fitted./five.fitted billion from long-term debt, the issuance of a commercial paper program of \u20ac /one.fitted./three.fitted billion and increased lease liabilities due to the adoption of IFRS /one.fitted/six.fitted. Set against these factors were decreases resulting from \u20ac /four.fitted./zero.fitted billion repayment of euro and U. S. dollar instruments and from derecognition of loans from banks in connection with the spin-off of Siemens Energy.",

        "page_content": "Long-term debt increased due primarily to the issuance of euro and British pound instruments totaling \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted./three.fitted billion and increased lease liabilities due to the above-mentioned adoption of IFRS /one.fitted/six.fitted. Set against these factors were decreases from the above-mentioned re classifications of euro instruments, currency translation effects for bonds issued in the U. S. dollar and British pound, and the Siemens Energy spin-off.\n\nThe main factors for the decrease in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were changes in equity resulting from major portfolio transactions totaling  \u20ac /nine.fitted./six.fitted billion,  including  the  transfer  of  /five.fitted/five.fitted %  of Siemens' ownership interest in Siemens Energy to its shareholders; dividend payments of \u20ac /three.fitted./two.fitted billion (for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted); negative other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of \u20ac /two.fitted./eight.fitted billion, resulting mainly from negative currency translation effects; and the repurchase of /one.fitted/nine.fitted,/zero.fitted/seven.fitted/one.fitted,/seven.fitted/four.fitted/six.fitted treasur y shares at an average cost per share of \u20ac /seven.fitted/nine.fitted./two.fitted/four.fitted, totaling \u20ac /one.fitted./five.fitted billion (including incidental transaction charges). This decrease was partly offset by \u20ac /four.fitted./zero.fitted billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG.\n\n## CAPITAL STRUCTURE RATIO\n\nOur capital structure ratio as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted increased to /one.fitted./three.fitted from /zero.fitted./six.fitted a year earlier. The change was due primarily to the above-mentioned increases in longterm debt.\n\n## DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we recorded, in total, \u20ac /three.fitted/eight.fitted./three.fitted billion in notes and bonds, \u20ac /one.fitted./four.fitted billion in loans from banks, \u20ac /two.fitted./one.fitted billion in other financial indebtedness and \u20ac /two.fitted./eight.fitted billion in lease liabilities. Notes and bonds were issued mainly in the U. S. dollar and euro, and to a lower extent in the British pound.\n\nWe have credit facilities totaling \u20ac /two.fitted/three.fitted./zero.fitted billion, thereof \u20ac /two.fitted/three.fitted./zero.fitted billion unused as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. This includes a syndicated bridge facility in an amount of nearly \u20ac /one.fitted/two.fitted./five.fitted billion to secure Siemens Healthineers AG's financing of the acquisition of Varian. For further information about this acquisition see NOTE /three.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS .\n\nFor further information about our debt see NOTE /one.fitted/six.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS . For further information about the functions and objectives of our financial risk management see NOTE /two.fitted/five.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS .\n\n## OFF-BALANCE-SHEET COMMITMENTS\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the undiscounted amount of maximum potential future payments related primarily to credit and performance guarantees amounted to \u20ac /two.fitted/eight.fitted./five.fitted billion. This includes Siemens' obligations from performance and credit guarantees in connection with the Siemens Energy business, for which Siemens has reimbursement rights for the full amount.\n\nIn addition to these commitments, we issued other guarantees. To the extent future claims are not considered remote, maximum future payments from these commitments amounted to \u20ac /zero.fitted./four.fitted billion.\n\nIrrevocable loan commitments amounted to \u20ac /three.fitted./eight.fitted billion. A considerable portion of these commitments resulted from asset-based lending transactions, meaning that the respective loans can be drawn only after the borrower has provided sufficient collateral.\n\nFor further information about our commitments and contingencies see NOTE /two.fitted/one.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS .\n\n## SHARE BUYBACK\n\nOut of the above-mentioned treasury shares repurchased in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, /one.fitted/eight.fitted,/two.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted,/seven.fitted/zero.fitted/eight.fitted treasur y shares were repurchased under the share buyback announced in November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted of up to \u20ac /three.fitted./zero.fitted billion in volume until November /one.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted at the latest. Furthermore, the Company repurchased the number of treasury shares that were necessary to keep the stock of treasury shares stable on a certain level until the spin-off of Siemens Energy became legally effective. In pursuit of this goal, a total of /eight.fitted/five.fitted/two.fitted,/zero.fitted/three.fitted/eight.fitted treasur y shares were repurchased.",

Within the industrial businesses, ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations; maintaining and extending our capacities for designing, manufacturing and marketing new solutions; improving productivity; and replacements of fixed assets. These investments amounted to \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nThe remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate, including significant amounts for projects such as new office buildings in Germany. Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customer-specific real estate solutions; excluded are Siemens Healthineers and Mobility.\n\nWith regard to capital expenditures for continuing operations, we expect a significant increase in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. In the coming years, up to \u20ac /zero.fitted./six.fitted billion are to be invested in 'Siemensstadt /two.fitted./zero.fitted'. This project initiated in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted aims to transform Siemens' existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key technologies. Further investments are planned in relation to Siemens Campus Erlangen. In addition, we plan to invest significant amounts in coming years in attractive innovation fields through Siemens' global venture capital unit Next/four.fitted/seven.fitted.",

        "page_content": "A./seven.fitted\n\n## Overall assessment of the economic position\n\nFor Siemens, fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted was to a large extent determined by two factors, one external - COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted - and one internal - the spin-off and public listing of our energy business.\n\nThe worldwide spread of COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted led to the biggest health crisis and the deepest recession since the Second World War and affected many of our key customer industries. Siemens managed this challenge well. The health and security of our employees and business partners was - and continues to be - our highest priority. Our other key priorities during the crisis have been ensuring business continuity wherever possible in a responsible manner  and  safeguarding  Siemens'  strong  financial position. While the pandemic has affected our markets in various ways and with different prospects for recovery, Siemens has remained a reliable partner for customers and suppliers. The pandemic has increased activity in the digital economy and underscored the need for digitalization and the development of the industrial internet of things. These are core competencies of Siemens, and common to each of our industrial businesses Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nDuring fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we created an independent player in the energy market with the spin-off and public listing of our energy business under the name Siemens Energy. Following approval by our shareholders, we completed this transaction in September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted as planned. We allocated /five.fitted/five.fitted./zero.fitted % of our ownership interest in Siemens Energy to our shareholders, transferred a further /nine.fitted./nine.fitted % to Siemens Pension-Trust e. V., and hold the remaining share of /three.fitted/five.fitted./one.fitted %. This gives Siemens Energy more entrepreneurial freedom in its rapidly changing market environment. The three Siemens companies - Siemens, Siemens Healthineers and Siemens Energy - are now a family of companies specialized in their respective fields and tied together by the strong Siemens brand.\n\nAt the beginning of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we already faced macroeconomic headwinds, particularly at our short-cycle businesses. In addition, effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted began to burden volume, the Adjusted EBITA and the Adjusted EBITA margin of our industrial businesses from the second quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted onwards. As a consequence, we were no longer able to confirm the original outlook for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted given in our Annual Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. In our Half-year Financial Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted we revised our outlook for revenue growth and refrained from giving guidance for basic EPS from net income for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. While we continued to deliver solid results in our industrial businesses and in Siemens Financial Services, particularly given the adverse economic environment, we missed the targets for our primary measures set in our Annual Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, but achieved our revised target for revenue development. On a comparable basis, revenue declined /two.fitted %, we delivered basic EPS from net income of \u20ac /five.fitted./zero.fitted/zero.fitted, return on capital employed (ROCE) was /seven.fitted./eight.fitted %, and our capital structure came in at /one.fitted./three.fitted.\n\nOrders were \u20ac /six.fitted/zero.fitted./zero.fitted billion, down /seven.fitted % year-over-year on both a nominal and a comparable basis. The decline came mainly from Mobility, due to sharply lower volume from large orders year-over-year, partly caused by the postponement of tenders for large rail and infrastructure projects as a consequence of COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted. Lower volume from large orders was also a main reason for a clear decline in orders at Smart Infrastructure. Digital Industries kept orders on the prior-year level with rapid growth in its software business, while orders in its automation businesses declined due to lower demand from some of their most important customer segments, particularly the auto motive and machine building industries. Orders at Siemens Healthineers rose slightly on increases in its diagnostics and imaging businesses. The book-to-bill-ratio for Siemens was /one.fitted./zero.fitted/five.fitted, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above /one.fitted.",

        "page_content": "Revenue declined /two.fitted % on both a nominal and a comparable basis, to \u20ac /five.fitted/seven.fitted./one.fitted billion. This was due mainly to a clear decrease at Digital Industries' automation businesses, and a more modest decline at Smart Infrastructure. Siemens Healthineers kept revenue on the prior-year level, while revenue at Mobility rose slightly driven primarily by the rolling stock business. In our Annual Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, we had forecast moderate comparable revenue growth for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. In our Half-year Financial Report, we revised our expectation to a moderate decline in comparable revenue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nAdjusted EBITA Industrial Businesses declined /three.fitted % to \u20ac /seven.fitted./six.fitted billion on  lower  Adjusted  EBITA  at  Siemens Healthineers, at Smart Infrastructure including declines across its businesses, and at Mobility due in part to a less favorable revenue mix. These decreases were only partly offset by higher Adjusted EBITA at Digital Industries, which included a strong contribution from the software business and benefited from a \u20ac /zero.fitted./eight.fitted billion positive effect related mainly to a revaluation of its stake in Bentley. Overall, Adjusted EBITA Industrial Businesses was burdened by severance charges of \u20ac /zero.fitted./five.fitted billion, sharply higher than a year earlier. The vast majority of these severance charges were booked at Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, which are executing cost structure improvement and competitiveness programs.\n\nThe Adjusted EBITA margin of our Industrial Businesses was /one.fitted/four.fitted./three.fitted %, nearly on the prior-year level of /one.fitted/four.fitted./four.fitted %. With Adjusted EBITA margins of /two.fitted/one.fitted./seven.fitted % and /nine.fitted./one.fitted %, respectively, Digital Industries and Mobility were within their longterm margin ranges; Digital Industries was within its range even without the above-mentioned effect related to Bentley, which added /five.fitted./one.fitted percentage points to the Adjusted EBITA margin. With Adjusted EBITA margins of /one.fitted/five.fitted./one.fitted % and /nine.fitted./one.fitted %, respectively, Siemens Healthineers and Smart Infrastructure were below their long-term margin ranges.\n\nThe loss outside the Industrial Businesses came in substantially larger year-over-year. The change was due mainly to an impairment of \u20ac /zero.fitted./five.fitted billion on our equity investment stake in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. In addition, Siemens Financial Services reported a sharp decline in earnings before taxes on higher credit\n\nrisk provisions and lower equity investment results yearover-year, and a return on equity after tax of /one.fitted/one.fitted./seven.fitted %, below its margin range. Prior-year results outside the Industrial Businesses benefited from a significant positive effect related to the measurement of a major asset retirement obligation.\n\nNet income was \u20ac /four.fitted./two.fitted billion, down from \u20ac /five.fitted./six.fitted billion yearover-year. This was due mainly to the aforementioned lower results, particularly outside the Industrial Businesses. In addition, discontinued operations, largely related to our former energy business, reported a loss of \u20ac /zero.fitted./one.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted compared to income from discontinued operations of \u20ac /zero.fitted./five.fitted billion a year earlier. As a result, basic EPS from net income declined to \u20ac /five.fitted./zero.fitted/zero.fitted, compared to \u20ac /six.fitted./four.fitted/one.fitted in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. In our Annual Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, we forecast basic EPS from net income in the range from \u20ac /six.fitted./three.fitted/zero.fitted to \u20ac /seven.fitted./zero.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nROCE for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted was /seven.fitted./eight.fitted %, down from /one.fitted/one.fitted./one.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. This decline was due to a combination of lower net income and an increase in average capital employed. Our forecast for ROCE given in our Annual Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted was to achieve a double-digit result but to come in below the lower end of our long-term goal of /one.fitted/five.fitted % to /two.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\nWe evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of industrial net debt to EBITDA. Due primarily to an increase in long-term debt year-over-year, this ratio rose to /one.fitted./three.fitted, compared to /zero.fitted./six.fitted in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. Our forecast given in our Annual Report /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted was to achieve a ratio of up to /one.fitted./zero.fitted.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted increased /one.fitted/zero.fitted % year-over-year to \u20ac /six.fitted./four.fitted billion, reaching its highest level since fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive return to shareholders. After the successful spin-off of Siemens Energy, the Siemens Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, proposes a dividend of \u20ac /three.fitted./five.fitted/zero.fitted per share, consisting of \u20ac /three.fitted./zero.fitted/zero.fitted, which is at the upper end of our targeted dividend payout ratio, supplemented by an additional \u20ac /zero.fitted./five.fitted/zero.fitted. A year earlier the dividend paid per share was \u20ac /three.fitted./nine.fitted/zero.fitted.",

Global GDP is projected to expand by /four.fitted./four.fitted % in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The risks and uncertainties surrounding this baseline forecast are unusually large. The further development of the virus outbreak (e. g. waves of new infections, lockdowns, and possible mutations), advances in medical treatment, availability and acceptance of vaccines, possible spillover effects from weak demand (especially in contact-intensive service sectors) or from financial market tensions (increasing insolvencies) are very hard to predict at the start of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. In Europe, it is expected that the new wave of infection in October and November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, with varying degrees of lockdowns in different countries, will interrupt the recovery and lead to a decline in economic activity in the first quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. However, the impact is expected to be much less severe compared to spring /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, as the recovery is so far intact globally (especially in Asia and the U. S.) and no significant disruptions in global supply chains have been observed. High uncertainty also applies to significant political developments, such as the U. S.-China trade relationship and the U. K.'s exit from the EU, as well as to the longer-term outcome of the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted U. S. election cycle.\n\nIn our baseline forecast, we assume that vaccines will be generally available during the first half of calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and immunization of large parts of the population will occur during /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Until then, contact-intensive industries will still be subject to severe restraints. Based on these assumptions, the EU economy is expected to expand by /four.fitted./one.fitted % in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, U. S. /three.fitted./seven.fitted %, China /seven.fitted./three.fitted %, Japan /two.fitted./two.fitted % and India /nine.fitted./two.fitted %. Given the steep decline in economic activity in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, this is only a moderate rebound with still a high level of under-utilized resources, which\n\nwill weigh on overall investment activity. Accordingly, global fixed investments are expected to expand by only /three.fitted./seven.fitted % in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, after a decline of /four.fitted./nine.fitted % in calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. In addition, important customer industries for Siemens  are  suffering  from  effects  related  to  both COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted and structural problems, e. g. machine-building (weak capacity utilization), oil and gas (decarbonization), automotive (accelerated structural change). Therefore, fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted is expected to bring many headwinds for Siemens' market environment. On the positive side, opportunities could arise from large government stimulus programs, which may be set in place in the next years.\n\nThe forecasts presented here for GDP and fixed investments are based on a report from IHS Markit dated October /one.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\n## A./eight.fitted./one.fitted. /two.fitted Siemens Group\n\nWe are basing our outlook for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted for the Siemens Group and its reportable segments on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation as well as the specific market conditions we expect for our respective industrial businesses, as described in A./three.fitted SEGMENT INFORMATION . For our outlook for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, we assume that the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic will not have a long-lasting impact on the world economy. Given this condition, we expect a fairly robust return to global GDP growth. While we anticipate that important customer industries for Siemens will continue to face challenges related to the pandemic and industryspecific structural changes, and that this will cause growth in global fixed investments to lag behind GDP growth, we expect improved conditions particularly for our high-margin short-cycle businesses in the second half of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nExcluded from this outlook are burdens from legal and regulatory issues and effects in connection with Siemens Healthineers' planned acquisition of Varian, which is",

S. dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, particularly the Chinese yuan. While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. Nevertheless, Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. In addition to the natural hedging strategy just mentioned, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Nevertheless, based on currency exchange rates as of the beginning of November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we anticipate that negative currency effects will strongly burden both nominal growth rates in volume and Adjusted EBITA for our businesses in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nBased on these assumptions and exclusions, our outlook is as follows:\n\n## SEGMENTS\n\nDigital Industries expects fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted comparable revenue to grow modestly year-over-year. Adjusted EBITA margin is expected at /one.fitted/seven.fitted % to /one.fitted/eight.fitted %.\n\nSmart Infrastructure expects to achieve moderate comparable revenue growth in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Adjusted EBITA margin is expected at /one.fitted/zero.fitted % to /one.fitted/one.fitted %.\n\nDue mainly to executing its large order backlog, Mobility anticipates mid-single-digit comparable revenue growth in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be /nine.fitted./five.fitted % to  /one.fitted/zero.fitted./five.fitted %.\n\nSiemens Healthineers expects to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of /five.fitted % to /eight.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to improve considerably and to come in slightly below our target margin range for this segment of /one.fitted/seven.fitted % to /two.fitted/one.fitted %.\n\nSiemens Financial Services is expected to achieve significant improvements year-over-year and to approach the target range for return on equity (ROE) (after tax) of /one.fitted/seven.fitted % to /two.fitted/two.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\n## REVENUE GROWTH\n\nFor comparable revenue, net of currency translation and portfolio  effects,  we  expect  the  Siemens  Group  to achieve moderate growth. Furthermore, we anticipate that orders in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted will exceed revenue for a bookto-bill ratio above /one.fitted.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, our order backlog totaled \u20ac /seven.fitted/zero.fitted billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue growth in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted with approximately \u20ac /two.fitted/eight.fitted billion of past orders converted to current revenue. For expected conversion of order backlog to revenue for our respective segments, see A./three.fitted SEGMENT INFORMATION .\n\n## PROFITABILITY\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned expectations for our segments, we expect our fully consolidated units within Portfolio Companies to be profitable while equity investments therein are expected to be volatile and to continue to generate losses. Results related to our investment in Siemens Energy include our participation in its profit after tax and amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation due to the initial recognition of the investment at fair value. We anticipate this amortization, which is expected to be approximately \u20ac /zero.fitted./three.fitted billion after tax in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, to result in a substantial loss related to Siemens Energy Investment. We anticipate that Siemens Real Estate will continue with real estate disposals depending on market conditions, at a lower level compared to fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Corporate items and Centrally carried pension expenses, which were a negative \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion are expected on a similar level in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, including impacts of approximately \u20ac /zero.fitted./two.fitted billion to \u20ac /zero.fitted./three.fitted billion related to Siemens Energy. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations, which was \u20ac /zero.fitted./seven.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, is expected at \u20ac /zero.fitted./six.fitted billion, and Eliminations, Corporate Treasury and other reconciling items, which were a negative \u20ac /zero.fitted./two.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, are expected to be slightly more negative in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.",

We expect income from discontinued operations at a positive mid-triple-digit level, due primarily to a gain from the announced divestment of Flender, which is expected to close in the first half of calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nFor our net income guidance, we assume that the gain related to the announced divestment of Flender will be largely offset by burdens related to Siemens Energy and expected additional expenses remaining from the spinoff transaction.\n\nAssuming the expectations described above are fulfilled during fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, we anticipate net income to increase moderately from \u20ac /four.fitted./two.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted despite the strong currency headwinds.\n\nOur forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors. We expect solid project execution to continue in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. We plan to keep the ratio of R & D expenses to revenue above /eight.fitted % with a strong focus on software and digital technologies and to keep selling and general administrative expenses as a percent of revenue close to the fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted level of /one.fitted/eight.fitted./nine.fitted %. Severance charges, which were \u20ac /zero.fitted./six.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, are expected to be somewhat lower in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\n## CAPITAL EFFICIENCY\n\nOur long-term goal is to achieve a ROCE in the range of /one.fitted/five.fitted % to /two.fitted/zero.fitted %. Due mainly to factors currently influencing net income and average capital employed, particularly recent acquisitions at Siemens Healthineers, we expect ROCE to increase compared to /seven.fitted./eight.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted but to remain in the single-digit range in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. Additionally we expect the planned acquisition of Varian by Siemens Healthineers, which is excluded from this outlook, to constitute a significant burden on ROCE.\n\n## CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\nWe aim in general for a capital structure, defined as the ratio of industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations), of up to /one.fitted./zero.fitted. Due mainly to an increase in longterm debt year-over-year, this ratio came in at /one.fitted./three.fitted in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and is expected to remain above /one.fitted fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The planned acquisition of Varian by Siemens Healthineers\n\nmentioned above, which is excluded from this outlook, will also significantly influence our capital structure.\n\n## A./eight.fitted./one.fitted./three.fitted Overall assessment\n\nFor  our  outlook  for  fiscal  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted  we  assume  that  the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic will not have a long-lasting impact on the world economy. Given this condition, we expect a fairly robust return to global GDP growth. While we anticipate that important customer industries for Siemens will continue to face challenges related to the pandemic and industry-specific structural changes, and that this will cause growth in global fixed investments to lag behind GDP growth, we expect improved conditions particularly for our high-margin short-cycle businesses in the second half of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nWe further anticipate that negative currency effects will strongly burden both nominal growth rates in volume and Adjusted EBITA for our industrial businesses in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nFor comparable revenue, net of currency translation and portfolio effects, we expect the Siemens Group to achieve moderate growth and a book-to-bill ratio above /one.fitted.\n\nAssuming the expectations described above are fulfilled during fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, we anticipate net income to increase moderately from \u20ac /four.fitted./two.fitted billion in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted despite the strong currency headwinds.\n\nFor our net income guidance, we assume that the gain related to the announced divestment of Flender will be largely offset by burdens related to Siemens Energy. Within our equity investment in Siemens Energy, we expect an \u20ac /zero.fitted./three.fitted billion impact from amortization of assets in addition to our participation in its profit after tax. We also expect expenses remaining from the spin-off transaction.\n\nExcluded from this outlook are burdens from legal and regulatory issues and effects in connection with Siemens Healthineers' planned acquisition of Varian, which is expected to close in the first half of calendar /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\nOverall, the actual development for Siemens and its segments may vary, positively or negatively, from our outlook due to the risks and opportunities described below or if our expectations and assumptions do not materialize.",

        "page_content": "## A.8.2  Risk management\n\n## A./eight.fitted./two.fitted./one.fitted Basic principles of risk management\n\nOur risk management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. Our organizational and accountability structure requires each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy.\n\n## A./eight.fitted./two.fitted./two.fitted Enterprise risk management process\n\nWe have implemented and coordinated a set of risk manage ment and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. The most important of these systems include our enterprise-wide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks well in advance of major business decisions, while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management. Accordingly, if deficits are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate measures for their elimination. This coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.\n\nRisk management at Siemens builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) 'Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Perfor-\n\nmance' (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard /three.fitted/one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our internal control system. They consider a company's strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.\n\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing control measures. If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e. g. as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entity's business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risks arising from the same subject (e. g. deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective managements of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizations mentioned above.",

        "page_content": "Responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. Our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction or acceptance of the relevant risk. Our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to 'seize' the relevant opportunity. In a second step, responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development, initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. These response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. Accordingly, we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. For example, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. Regarding our projects, systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones, including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes, assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage, even before the bidding phase. Furthermore, we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses. Among others, we address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries, and by adjusting capacity and implementing cost-reduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary. Worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans, from humans to humans and in other ways. Epidemic, pandemic or other spread patterns such as bioterrorism threaten to cause high disease rates in different countries, regions or continents. We constantly check information from the World Health Orga nization (WHO), the American and European Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the German Robert Koch Institute and other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as early as possible.\n\n## A./eight.fitted./two.fitted./three.fitted Risk management organization and responsibilities\n\nTo oversee the ERM process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Managing Board established a Risk Management and Internal Control Organization, led by the Head of Assurance. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion of risk at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-andeffect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. This aggregation naturally results in a mixture of risks, including those with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative risk assessment. Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk themes. Thematic risk and opportunity assessments then form the basis for the evaluation of the company-wide risk and opportunity situation. The Head of Assurance reports quarterly to the Managing Board on matters relating to the implementation, operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and assists the Managing Board, for example in reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## A.8.3  Risks\n\nBelow we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation. The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risks' current importance to us. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations. Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units.",

Current impacts from the pandemic vary considerably between regions and customer industries. Governments and other local authorities are striving to contain the spread of the disease by implementing various countermeasures ranging from recommending social distancing and new hygiene standards to imposing large-scale lockdowns and restrictions on opening conditions in certain sectors of the economy. Governments are expected to ease economic restrictions to relieve associated suffering depending on epidemiological trends and political pressure. As a result, the extent and duration of the individual effects on our business are extremely difficult to predict. For example, if containment measures are initiated on short notice or last unforeseeably long, this might significantly impact our business in a way that exceeds current expectations and might go beyond already initiated mitigation measures. We could be facing unexpected shutdowns of locations, factories or office buildings of our suppliers, customers or our own operations, thus impairing our ability to produce or deliver our products, solutions and services. Key uncertainties of the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted crisis are its duration, including for example potential additional waves of infections or mutations of the virus, and the economic cost of the lockdowns. Since the second quarter of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we gradually started to see the effects in our businesses, short-cycle as well as project businesses, as for example customers have been cancelling orders or delaying investments, we have been exposed to an increased risk of default and our supply chain has been experiencing difficulties in certain areas. Potential consequences include an unsustainable burden of public and private debt that hampers the post-pandemic recovery, severe disruptions in the financial system and bankruptcies among Siemens customers and suppliers. In the long term, a roll-back of globalization could reduce the potential for future growth. Various task forces and crisis teams have been set up across all functions of Siemens to diligently monitor and mitigate the diverse effects related to COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted including an enduring on securing the health and safety of our employees and business\n\ncontinuity. On Group level a senior management task force prepares overarching decisions and coordinates the flow of information through the various levels of the organization while empowering the responsible management in the businesses and countries to take actions appropriate to their respective contexts.\n\nEconomic, political and geopolitical conditions (macro-\n\neconomic deterioration): We see significant uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook. Especially the renewed severe escalation of the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic with a sustained long globally synchronized shutdown would stall the recovery already underway and lead to a new deep recession. Because the fiscal and monetary policy scope for action appears already largely exhausted, the economic impact could be much greater than in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. There is also great uncertainty about the long-term consequences of the pandemic for important Siemens customer industries, such as aerospace and non-residential construction. Moreover, during the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic essential trouble spots have not been defused and in some cases they even have intensified. A further escalation of the trade conflict between the U. S. and China into a full-fledged global trade war or even geopolitical conflict would significantly worsen global growth prospects. Adverse effects to confidence and investment activity would severely hit Siemens business. Increasing trade barriers would negatively impact production costs and productivity along our many value chains, as well as our sales markets. In addition, the probability of the U. K. exiting the European Single Market without a trade agreement has increased significantly. A 'No deal'-Brexit could trigger a deep recession in the U.K, thereby significantly reducing investment activity and posing a risk to the financial markets. A further and massive loss of economic confidence and a longer period of restraint in invest ment decisions and the awarding of new orders would have a negative impact on our business. We continuously monitor the exit process and coordinate our local and global risk mitigation measures. Uncertainties in the context of U. S. election results could potentially burden the global economy, including a stand-still in U. S. economic policy, with significant effects on investment decisions as well as on financial markets.

        "page_content": "significant risks arise from geopolitical tensions (particularly  in  the  Near  and  Middle  East,  Hong  Kong  and Taiwan), the  European Union's relations with Russia, the economic vulnerability of several emerging markets (including  Argentina, Turkey, Venezuela) and political upheavals. We are dependent on the economic development of certain industries, especially on continued weakness in the automotive markets we serve, caused by both, cyclical and structural forces. Further business risk would result from an abrupt weakening of Chinese economic growth. A terrorist mega-attack or a significant cybercrime  in cident,  or  a  series  of  such  attacks  or incidents in major economies, could depress economic activity globally and undermine consumer and business confidence.  Additionally,  the  highly  interconnected global economy remains vulnerable to natural disasters or further pandemics.\n\nIn general, due to long-cycle businesses in our organizational units and the importance of long-term contracts for Siemens, there is usually a time lag between changes in macroeconomic conditions and their impact on our financial results. In contrast, short-cycle business activities of Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure react quickly to volatility in market demand. If the moderate growth of certain markets stalls again and if we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects. For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed. Furthermore, the prices for our products, solutions and services may decline to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. In addition, it may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing. Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance payments by our customers relating to long-term projects, may become less favorable, which could negatively impact our financial condition. Siemens' global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e. g. equipment, components, systems,\n\nsoftware, services and solutions) help us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market.\n\nPortfolio measures, at-equity investments, other investments and strategic alliances: Our strategy includes divesting our activities in some business areas and strengthening others through portfolio measures, including mergers and acquisitions. With respect to divestments, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. There can be no assurance that any of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and in a timely manner as originally planned, or that they will perform as anticipated once integrated. In addition, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative, tax and other expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration of acquired businesses. Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needs and adversely affect our capital structure. Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions to intangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. If we were to encounter continuing adverse business develop ments or if we were otherwise to perform worse than expected at acquisition activities, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, might have to be impaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. Our investment portfolio includes investments held for purposes other than trading and other investments. Any factors negatively influencing the financial condition and results of operations of our at-equity investments and other investments could have an adverse effect on our equity pick-up related to these investments or may result in a related write-off. In addition, our business situation, financial condition and results of operations could also be adversely affected in connection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to these investments. Furthermore, such investments are inherently risky as we may not be able to sufficiently",

In addition, joint ventures bear the risk of difficulties that may arise when integrating people, operations, technologies and products. Strategic alliances may also pose risks for us because we compete in some business areas with companies with which we have strategic alliances. Besides other measures, we handle these risks with standardized processes as well as dedicated roles and responsibilities in the areas of mergers, acquisitions, divestments and carve-outs. This includes the systematic treatment of all contractual obligations and post-closing claims.\n\nDisruptive technologies: The markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. In the fields of digitalization (e. g. IoT, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, Industry /four.fitted./zero.fitted), there are risks associated with new competitors, substitutions of existing  products / solutions / services,  new  business  models (e. g. in terms of pricing, financing, extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business) and finally the risk that our competitors may have more advanced time-to-market strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than Siemens. Our operating results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets and to optimize our cost base accordingly. Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success. Our results of operations may suffer if we invest in technologies that do not operate or may not be integrated as expected, or that are not accepted in the marketplace as anticipated, or if our products, solutions or systems are not introduced to the market in a timely manner, particularly compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete. We constantly apply for new patents and actively manage our intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position. However, our patents and other intellectual\n\nproperty may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours.\n\nCompetitive environment: The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands. We face strong established competitors and rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better cost structure. Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competition, a change in our relative market position, increase in inventory of finished or workin-progress goods or unexpected price erosion. Furthermore, there is a risk that critical suppliers are taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors are increasingly offering services to our installed base. We address these risks with various measures, for example benchmarking, strategic initiatives, sales push initiatives, executing productivity measures and target cost projects, rightsizing of our footprint, outsourcings, mergers and joint ventures and optimizing our product and service portfolio. We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.\n\nIncreasing sustainability focus: The increasing environmental, social and governance requirements from governments and customers as well as financing restrictions from governments, customer demands and financing restrictions for greenhouse gas emitting technologies could result in additional costs. Additionally, business involve ment in sensitive environmental, social or governance activities might be negatively perceived and trigger adverse media attention. This could lead to reputational damage and have an impact on achieving our business goals. We are implementing an environmental, social and governance due diligence tool during fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, which is mandatory for all Siemens units.",

        "page_content": "Footprint and Restructuring: We see risks that we may not be flexible enough in adjusting our organizational and manufacturing footprint in order to quickly respond to changing markets. The necessary restructuring might not be executed to the extent or in the timeframe planned (e. g. due to local co-determination regulations), limiting our improvements of our cost position with negative profit impacts and the loss of key personnel. Strikes and disputes with unions and workers councils might result in negative media coverage and delivery problems. Additionally, public criticism related to restructuring might negatively impact Siemens' reputation. We mitigate these risks by closely monitoring the implementation of the planned measures, maintaining strict cost management, and conducting ongoing discussions with all concerned interest groups.\n\n## A./eight.fitted./three.fitted. /two.fitted Operational risks\n\nCyber / Information  security: Digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio. We observe a global increase of cyber security threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime, which pose a risk to the security of products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. According to the various external data sources, this tendency has accelerated during the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic. Especially the number of phishing attacks as well as the number of malicious websites have increased significantly. Moreover, the information technology market is concentrated around a small number of information technology and software vendors, which could lead to dependence on a single provider. There can be no assurance that the measures aimed at protecting our Intellectual Property and portfolio will address these threats under all circumstances. There is a risk that confidential information may be stolen or that the integrity of our portfolio may be compromised, e. g. by attacks on our networks, social engineering, data manipulations in critical applications and a loss of critical resources, resulting in financial damages. Cyber security covers the IT of our entire enterprise including office IT, systems and applications, special purpose networks, and our operating environments such as manufacturing and research and development (R & D). Like other large multinational companies\n\nwe face active cyber threats from sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nationstates engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, considering new models of flexible working environments, and comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems through Cyber Defense with an artificial intelligence solution to identify attacks faster and prevent damage to society and especially to critical infrastructures, our customers, our partners and Siemens overall. We initiated the industrial 'Charter of Trust', signed by a growing group of global companies, which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital world. Nonetheless, our systems, products, solutions and services, as well as those of our service providers, remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Such attacks could potentially lead to the publication, manipulation or leakage of information such as through industrial espionage. They could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems, vulnerable products, production down  times and supply shortages, with potential adverse effects on our reputation, our competitiveness and results of operations. For increased protection of Siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents, we have assessed in detail the possibility of transferring risk. As a result of an international insurance tender, out currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies.\n\nInternal programs and initiatives: We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction initiatives, including ongoing capacity adjustment measures and structural initiatives. Consolidation of business activities and manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these costreduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to",

Furthermore, delays in critical R & D projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.\n\nProject-related risks: A number of our segments conduct activities, under long-term contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure. Some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting postcompletion warranty obligations. For example, we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. The profit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over the contract's term. We sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key personnel, quality problems, financial difficulties of our customers and /or significant partners, cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems, unforeseen developments at the project sites, unforeseen changes or difficulties in the regulatory or political environment, performance problems with our suppliers, subcontractors and consortium partners or other logistical difficulties. Some of our multi-year contracts also contain demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost and compliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantial contractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract termination. There can be no assurance that contracts and projects, in particular those with long-term duration and fixed-priced calculation, can be completed profitably. To tackle those risks, we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the technical and commercial capabilities of our\n\nproject management personnel. For very complex projects we conduct dedicated risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers.\n\nSupply chain management: The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components, sub-assemblies and materials. Capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in the future, especially if we use single-source suppliers for critical components. Shortages and delays could materially harm our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events (including pandemics), cyber incidents or suppliers' financial difficulties, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.\n\nShortage of skilled personnel: Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel (e. g. specialists, experts, digital talent) remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled employees and a need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to identify, assess and hire engineers, digital talent and other qualified personnel. We must also integrate, develop and retain them after they join us,",

Furthermore, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning.\n\n## A./eight.fitted./three.fitted./three.fitted Financial risks\n\nMarket price risks: We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, especially between the U. S. dollar and the euro, because a high percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from Europe to areas using the U. S. dollar. In addition, we are exposed to effects involving the currencies of emerging markets, in particular the Chinese yuan. Appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could materially change our competitive position. We are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. Even hedging activities to mitigate such risks may result in a reverse effect. Fluctuations in exchange or interest rates, negative developments in the financial markets and changes in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results.\n\nLiquidity and financing risks: Our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit and /or financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets, such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments, an updated evaluation of our solvency, particularly from rating agencies, negative interest rates, and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector, central bank policy, or the usage of financial instruments. Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial markets might lead to adverse changes in the market values of our financial assets, in particular our derivative financial instruments.\n\nCredit risks: We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activi-\n\nties if, for example, customers do not, only partially or late meet obligations arising from these financing arrangements.\n\nRisks from pension obligations: The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio. Additionally, they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design among other factors. A significant increase in the underfunding may have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs. In order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries, we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to change in funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries and the change of the regulations themselves.\n\nFor further information on post-employment benefits, derivative financial instruments, hedging activities, financial risk management and related measures, see NOTES /one.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/four.fitted and /two.fitted/five.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES  TO  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS .\n\n## Audits by tax authorities and changes in tax regula-\n\ntions: We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization, we conduct business in countries subject to complex tax rules, which may be interpreted in different ways. Future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.",

Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties. Moreover, any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/eight.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/nine.fitted corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U. S. and German authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.\n\nSiemens conducts a large share of its business with governments and government-owned enterprises. We also participate in a number of projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations, such as multilateral development banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business alliances, or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover, third parties, including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation.\n\nIn addition, future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations, such as responding to the\n\nrequests of governmental authorities and cooperating with them, could divert management's attention and resources from other issues facing our business. Furthermore, we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration.\n\nAlong with other measures, Siemens has established a global compliance organization that conducts among others compliance risk mitigation processes such as Compliance Risk Assessments or initiates internal audit activities performed by the internal assurance department.\n\nChanges of regulations, laws and policies: As a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product- and country-related regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. We monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas, with the aim of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions. However, any changes in regulations, laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nProtectionism (including tariffs / trade war): Protectionist trade policies and changes in the political and regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate, such as import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets and price or exchange controls, could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation, financial position and results of operations; and may expose us to penalties, other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to appropriate compliance programs.\n\n## Geopolitical uncertainties including sanctions and\n\nexport  control: As a globally operating organization, we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations, embargoes, economic sanctions, debarment policies or other forms of",

New or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. We are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U. S. Depart ment of State as state sponsors of terrorism. Therefore, it is possible that such policies may result in our being unable to gain or retain certain investors or customers. In addition, the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. Our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries.\n\n## Environmental, health & safety and other governmen-\n\ntal regulations: Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental, health and safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore, we see the risk of potential environmental and health and safety incidents as well as potential noncompliance with environmental and health and safety regulations affecting Siemens and our contractors or sub-suppliers, resulting for example in serious injuries, penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.\n\nIn addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties that we contract with, including suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us. Any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or\n\npermits that are important to our business operations. In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Current or future litigation and legal and regulatory\n\nproceedings: Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates. Some of these legal disputes and proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens or decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. The insurance policy, however, does not protect Siemens against reputational damage. Moreover, Siemens may incur losses relating to legal proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal proceedings. Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.\n\nFor additional information with respect to specific proceedings,  see NOTE /two.fitted/two.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES  TO  CONSOLIDATED FINAN CIAL  STATEMENTS .",

We currently see this strategic risk as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk arising from  cyber / information  security.\n\nAt present, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## A.8.4  Opportunities\n\nWithin our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order in which the opportunities are presented reflects  the  currently  estimated  relative  exposure  for Siemens associated with these opportunities and thus provides an indication of the opportunities' current importance to us. The described opportunities are not necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.\n\nValue creation through innovation: We drive innovation by investing significantly in R & D in order to develop sustainable  solutions  for  our  customers  while  also strengthening our own competitiveness. Being an innovative company and constantly inventing new technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change, urbanization, climate change and globalization is one of our core purposes. We are granted thousands of new patents every year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and data-driven business models. This helps us create the next generation of ground-breaking innovations in such fields as digitalization, artificial intelligence, autonomous machines and edge computing. Across our operating units, we are profiting from our strength in the 'Digital Enterprise.' Foremost, our cloud-based MindSphere platform enhances the availability of our customers' digital products and systems and improves their productivity and efficiency. We offer edge computing apps along with Mindsphere in individual facilities, so that customers can connect all their facilities to create an integrated data network. We see also significant opportunities to generate additional volume and profit from innovative digital products, services and solutions, including cyber security and applications for optimized energy consumption. We see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through new marketing and sales strategies, which we implement in our operating units. Our position along the value chains of automation and digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration. Along these value chains, we have identified several concrete growth fields in which we see our greatest long-term potential. Hence, we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth fields.",

Furthermore, we aim to increase our sales via improved account management and new distribution channels.\n\nTurning COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted challenges into opportunities: The participation in governmental COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted recovery programs such as the European Union's 'Next Generation EU' recovery plan is an opportunity for Siemens. There is also the chance to strengthen our customer relationship through additional market offerings that specifically address use cases related directly to the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic. Potential growth areas might arise through the optimization program 'new normal' with, for example, more working flexibility for our employees.\n\nMergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio: We constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which may complement our organic growth. Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. Opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.\n\nFavorable political and regulatory environment (including sustainability): We see opportunities from potential improvement in the geopolitical policy environment,  which  could  quickly  restore  a  more  positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of our markets. In addition, government initiatives and\n\nsubsidies (including tax reforms among others) may lead to more government spending (e. g. infrastructure or digitalization investments) and ultimately result in an opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. By enabling our customers to lower their GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions across our portfolio and by reducing CO /two.fitted emission in our own operation, Siemens strives to support the trend towards a low- carbon economy. Recent legislative and governmen tal accelerate to mitigate climate change worldwide,  especially in Europe through e. g. the Green Deal or Sustainable Finance Initiative represent an opportunity for Siemens.\n\nOptimization of organization and processes: On the one hand, we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure, such as common computing architecture for image processing or optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times. On the other hand, we see an opportunity of further penetrating markets by ramping up local business excellence (e. g. engineering) and increasing local sourcing and local manufacturing.\n\nAssessment of the overall opportunities situation: The most significant opportunity for Siemens continues to be value creation through innovation as described above.\n\nWhile our assessments of individual opportunities have changed during fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, our endeavors to profit from them and revision of our strategic plans, the overall opportunity situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year.",

        "page_content": "## A.8.5  Significant characteristics of the accounting-related internal control and risk management system\n\nThe overarching objective of our accounting-related internal control and risk management system is to ensure that financial reporting is conducted in a proper manner, such that the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report of Siemens Group as well as the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG as the parent company are prepared in accordance with all relevant regulations.\n\nOur ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) 'Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy and Performance' (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted /seven.fitted) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard /three.fitted/one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our internal control system. They consider a company's strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations,  the  reliability  of  its  financial  reporting  and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important. Our accounting-related internal control system is based on the internationally recognized 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/three.fitted) also developed  by  COSO.  The  two  systems  are  complementary.\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented control system, both in design and operating effectiveness. We have a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements.\n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts. For Siemens AG and other companies within the Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code. The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis. Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective.\n\nThe base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries. The preparation of the closing data of most of our entities is supported by an internal shared services organization. Furthermore, other accounting activities, such as governance and monitoring activities, are usually bundled on a regional level. In particular cases, such as valuations relating to postemployment benefits, we use external experts. The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system. The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls.\n\nQualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection  processes and training. As a fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the 'four eyes' principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization. Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In line with our information security requirements, accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from unauthorized access. The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the International Financial Report-",

The management of Siemens Healthineers provides periodic sign-offs to the Managing Board of Siemens AG, certifying the effectiveness of its accounting-related internal control system as well as the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of the financial data reported to us.\n\nOur internal audit function systematically evaluates our financial reporting integrity, the effectiveness of the control system and the risk management system, and adherence to our compliance policies. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan. Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant for our Managing Board and Audit Committee first have to be mandated by Siemens Healthineers' Managing Board and Audit Committee and subsequently be mandated by our Managing Board and Audit Committee. The audit procedures for these topics will be generally executed in joint teams of our and Siemens Healthineers' internal audit functions; thus reflecting the interest of both Siemens AG and Siemens Healthineers.

KG (formerly Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG) by means of singular succession. Furthermore, domestic and foreign investments attributable to the Siemens Energy business were transferred to Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG, indirectly or directly. These transfers resulted in an increase in shares in affiliated companies, and a decrease in transferred assets and liabilities, particularly including property, plant and equipment, securities, inventories, receivables and other assets, advance payments received, provisions for pensions and other provisions. In addition, the transfers resulted in a corresponding year-overyear decline in income and expenses, particular including revenue, cost of sales, gross profit, research and development expenses as well as selling expenses.\n\nWith regard to the spin-off, on September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (spinoff day), Siemens AG contributed, in a first step, indirectly or directly, its interests in Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG and also in its general partner to Siemens Energy AG in return for the issuance of shares. In a second step, Siemens AG transferred its remaining interests in Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG and in its general partner to Siemens Energy AG in a spin-off in accordance  with  the  German  Transformation  Act (Umwandlungsgesetz). This step followed the approval by the extraordinary shareholder's meeting on July /nine.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted in return for the issuance of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the shareholders of Siemens AG. The interests transferred represented the equivalent of /five.fitted/five.fitted % of the subscribed capital of Siemens Energy AG.\n\nAs of the end of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, results for Siemens AG arise mainly from the business activities of Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and Portfolio Companies and are influenced significantly by the results of subsidiaries and investments we own either directly or indirectly. The business development of Siemens AG is fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as the Siemens Group. Therefore, the foregoing explanations for the Siemens Group apply also for Siemens AG. We expect that income from investments or profit transfer agreements with affiliated companies and a substantial gain related to an agreement to sell Flender GmbH, Germany, for a price of \u20ac /two.fitted./zero.fitted billion will significantly influence the profit of Siemens AG.\n\nWe intend to continue providing an attractive return to shareholders. Therefore, we intend to propose a dividend whose distribution volume is within a dividend payout range of /four.fitted/zero.fitted % to /six.fitted/zero.fitted % of net income of the Siemens Group attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG, which we may adjust for this purpose to exclude selected exceptional non-cash effects. For fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, we expect that net income of Siemens AG will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a corresponding dividend.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the number of employees was /five.fitted/zero.fitted,/four.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted.",

I. S., Africa, Middle East region, /one.fitted/six.fitted % in the Asia, Australia region and /seven.fitted % in the Americas region. Exports from Germany accounted for /five.fitted/three.fitted % of overall revenue. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, orders for Siemens AG amounted to \u20ac /one.fitted/four.fitted./seven.fitted billion.\n\nThe R & D intensity (R & D as a percentage of revenue) was /one.fitted/zero.fitted %, nearly on the same level as fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. The research and development activities of Siemens AG are fundamentally the same as for its corresponding business activities within the Siemens Group. On an average basis, we employed /seven.fitted,/three.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted people in R & D in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nThe change in other operating income (expenses), net, was mainly due to a gain of \u20ac /nine.fitted./five.fitted billion related to Siemens AG's transfer of the trademark 'Siemens' to the affiliated company Siemens Trademark GmbH & Co. KG, Germany, in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted other operating expenses included primarily expenses in connection with the valuation of an investment as well as expenses related to the carve-out of the Siemens Energy business.\n\nThe increase in financial income, net was primarily attributable to higher income from investments, net. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted we recorded a number of major changes compared to fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, including income of \u20ac /one.fitted./three.fitted billion from the profit transfer agreement with Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH, Germany; income of \u20ac /one.fitted./four.fitted billion from the investment in Siemens Holdings plc, Ltd., United  Kingdom; and a gain of \u20ac /two.fitted./one.fitted billion from the disposal of Siemens Limited, India. These factors were partly offset by an impairment of \u20ac /one.fitted./three.fitted billion on the shares in Siemens Energy AG. Financial income, net, also included an impairment of a loan receivable of \u20ac /zero.fitted./five.fitted billion related to an investment.\n\nThe change in income taxes was primarily due to the recognition  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  related  to  the transfer of the trademark 'Siemens' in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.",

The Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board develops corresponding recommendations and prepares, in particular, the proposals for decisions by the Supervisory Board's plenary meetings. The Supervisory Board may consult external advisors when necessary. The system approved by the Supervisory Board is then presented to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for endorsement.\n\nThe current compensation system for the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG has been in place since fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and was endorsed at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted by a majority of /nine.fitted/four.fitted./five.fitted/one.fitted %.\n\n## BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE MANAGING BOARD COMPENSATION  SYSTEM\n\nThe Managing Board compensation system contributes to the execution of the Company's strategy: The compensation system is designed to motivate Managing Board members to achieve the strategic goals defined in 'Vision /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted+.' The system promotes inno vation and fosters incentives for the Company's value- creating and long-term development while avoiding excessive risks.\n\nThe Supervisory Board makes decisions regarding the design of the compensation system and the structure and amount of the Managing Board members' compensation with due consideration of the following principles:\n\nCompensation linked to performance\n\nConsideration of the collective and individual performance of Managing Board members\n\nCompatibility of compensation systems\n\nAppropriateness of compensation\n\n- Extraordinary performance should be appropriately rewarded, and failure to achieve targets should lead to an appreciable reduction of compensation.\n- Compensation takes into account the individual performance of Managing Board members in their respective areas of responsibility. Overall responsibility for the Company's long-term development is represented by targets set at the Group level. These targets apply equally to all Managing Board members.\n- The compensation system for Managing Board members also extends to the other management levels in the Group.\n- The compensation of Managing Board members should conform to market conditions and be appropriate for the Company's size, complexity and economic situation.",

Fixed, non-performance-based compensation comprises base salary, fringe benefits and a pension commitment. Short-term variable compensation (Bonus) and long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) are granted as performance-based compensation and are thus variable.\n\nComponents comprising the Managing Board compensation system\n\n## Total target compensation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Fixed components   | Fixed components   | Variable components                       | Variable components                             | Share Ownership   Guidelines   |\n|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Base salary        | Fringe benefits    | Short-term  variable compensation (Bonus) | Long-term  variable compensation (Stock Awards) | Share Ownership   Guidelines   |\n|                    | Pension commitment | Short-term  variable compensation (Bonus) | Long-term  variable compensation (Stock Awards) | Share Ownership   Guidelines   |\n\nThe Supervisory Board determines, in accordance with the compensation system, the amount of each Managing Board member's total target compensation for the upcoming fiscal year. This determination is based on an appropriate  consideration  of  the  Managing  Board member's tasks and performance and the Company's economic situation, performance and future prospects.\n\nThe Supervisory Board ensures that total target compensation conforms to market conditions. For assessing the market conformance of total compensation, compensation data for companies included in the DAX, the German blue-chip stock index, and for comparable non-listed companies (insofar as these are available) are considered.  In  view  of  Siemens'  international  footprint, compensation  data  for  companies  included  in  the STOXX Europe /five.fitted/zero.fitted index are also considered. In this\n\nhorizontal market comparison, the Supervisory Board considers Siemens' market position, industry affiliation, size and global presence. In addition, the Supervisory Board considers the development of Managing Board compensation in relation to the compensation of the employees of Siemens in Germany. In this vertical comparison, it conducts a market comparison of the ratio of Managing Board compensation to the compensation of upper management and the wider workforce with the corresponding ratios at companies included in the DAX. For this  purpose, the Supervisory Board has defined upper  management as the executive employees in the Senior  Management  and  Top  Management  contract groups. The wider workforce is divided into employees who are  covered by collective bargaining agreements and those who are not.\n\nIn addition, the Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key component of the compensation system. They obligate Managing Board members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined multiple.\n\nThe Managing Board compensation system is also supplemented by appropriate and market-based commitments granted in connection with the commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of work.",

In doing so, the Supervisory Board ensures that the proportions of total target compensation represented by each of the individual compensation components are within the following percentage ranges:\n\n- fixed compensation: minimum /three.fitted/six.fitted % to maximum /four.fitted/three.fitted % of total target compensation\n- short-term variable compensation (Bonus): minimum /two.fitted/zero.fitted % to maximum /two.fitted/eight.fitted % of total target compensation\n- long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards): minimum /three.fitted/zero.fitted % to maximum /four.fitted/two.fitted % of total target compensation.\n\n## FIXED COMPENSATION COMPONENTS\n\nFixed, non-performance-based compensation comprises the base salary, fringe benefits and the pension commitment.\n\n## Base salary\n\nEach Managing Board member receives a base salary, which is paid in /one.fitted/two.fitted monthly installments.\n\n## Fringe benefits\n\nA maximum value of fringe benefits for the upcoming fiscal year is established for each Managing Board member. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board determines an amount relative to base salary. This amount covers expenses incurred to the benefit of the Managing Board  member, for example, in-kind compensation and fringe benefits granted by the Company, including the provision of a company car, insurance allowances and medical check-ups.\n\n## Pension commitment\n\nLike the employees of Siemens AG, the members of the Managing Board are included for the most part in the Siemens Defined Contribution Pension Plan (BSAV). Under the BSAV, Managing Board members receive contributions that are credited to their pension accounts. Newly appointed members of the Managing Board can be granted, instead of a BSAV contribution, a fixed cash amount that he or she can freely dispose of.\n\nIf a member of the Managing Board earned a pension entitlement from the Company before the BSAV was introduced, a portion of his or her contributions will go toward financing this legacy entitlement.\n\nOther essential characteristics of the BSAV for Managing Board members are summarized in the following table:\n\n| Upon request, on or after reaching the  age of /six.fitted/two.fitted for pension commitments  made on or after January /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/two.fitted                               | Entitlement           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| In accordance with the provisions of  the German Company Pensions Act                                                                                                                                            | Vested status         |\n| As a rule, in /one.fitted/two.fitted yearly installments;  other payment options, on request,  are: ten or /one.fitted/one.fitted installments, a lump sum  payment and an annuitization with                    | Disbursement          |\n| Annual guaranteed interest credited  to the pension account until benefits  are first drawn (currently: /zero.fitted./nine.fitted %)                                                                             | Guaranteed   interest |\n| The risk that benefits may have to   be drawn before the age of /six.fitted/zero.fitted due   to disability or death is mitigated by  crediting contributions from the age  at the time benefits are first drawn | Disability /death     |\n\nLike other eligible employees of Siemens AG, Managing Board members who were employed by the Company before September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /one.fitted/nine.fitted/eight.fitted/three.fitted are entitled to transition payments equal to the difference between the last base salary and the pension entitlement under the Company pension plan in the first six months after retirement.\n\n## VARIABLE COMPENSATION COMPONENTS\n\nThe variable, performance-based compensation of Managing Board members is tied to performance and aligned with the Company's short- and long-term development.

Performance criteria are derived from the Company's strategic goals and operational steering.

Ultimately, the performance criteria measure successful value creation in all its different forms, as strategically envisioned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Supervisory Board ensures that targets are demanding and ambitious. If they are not met, variable com pensation can be reduced to as little as zero. If the targets are substantially exceeded, target attainment is limited to /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\nIn addition, there are malus and clawback regulations that allow the Supervisory Board to withhold or reclaim both short-term and long-term variable compensation in certain cases.\n\n## Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)\n\nShort-term variable compensation (Bonus) rewards the contribution in a fiscal year to the operational execution of the Company's strategy and therefore also to the Company's long-term performance. The Bonus system is based on three equally weighted target dimensions, which take account of the overall responsibility of the Managing Board as well as the Managing Board members' respective business responsibilities and their individual challenges:\n\n## 'Siemens Group'\n\nThe dimension 'Siemens Group' reflects the Managing Board's overall responsibility and measures the performance of the Siemens Group in its entirety, as the sum of the contributions of each individual part of the Company.\n\n## 'Managing Board portfolio'\n\nThe dimension 'Managing Board portfolio' focuses on the business activities for which each Managing Board\n\nmember is responsible and measures his or her performance based on the predefined portfolio strategy. In the case of mainly functional responsibility (for example, the President and CEO and the Chief Financial Officer), the performance of the Siemens Group is considered.\n\n## 'Individual targets'\n\nA minimum of two and a maximum of four individual targets allow for further differentiation depending on the specific strategic and operational challenges of each Managing Board member.\n\nPerformance criteria are assigned to each of the three target dimensions based on Company priorities and the responsibilities of each Managing Board member. The focus is on short-term measures that execute the Company's strategy, such as strengthening earnings and ensuring profitability /capital efficiency and liquidity.\n\nOne financial performance criterion is assigned to the 'Siemens Group' dimension and another to the 'Managing Board portfolio' dimension. The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the basis of key performance indicators. These key performance indicators are predominantly operational steering parameters derived from the Company's strategic direction. They are based on the Siemens Financial Framework and are also, as a rule, part of the Company's external financial reporting. See chapter A./two.fitted FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SYSTEM .",

        "page_content": "Growth and liquidity can both be employed as financial performance criteria in the 'Individual targets' dimension, as can additional non-financial performance criteria. In the case of non-financial performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so-called focus topics, which comprise both operational aspects of the execution of the Company's strategy - such as business performance, the execution of large-scale projects, optimization and efficiency enhancement - as well as sustainability aspects - such as diversity, ownership culture,\n\ncustomer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and succession planning.\n\nAfter the end of the fiscal year, target attainment for the key performance indicators for the target dimensions 'Siemens Group' and 'Managing Board portfolio' and the attainment for the individual targets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average. The percentage of weighted target attainment multiplied by the individual target amount yields the Bonus payout amount for the past fiscal year. The payable Bonus is limited to two times the target amount and is disbursed entirely in cash.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards)\n\nThe Managing Board is required to commit itself to the Company's  long-term  success,  promote  sustainable growth and achieve long-lasting value creation. In accordance with these principles, a significant part of total compensation is tied to the long-term performance of the Siemens share. Siemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. A Stock Award is the claim to one share - conditional on target attainment - after the expiration of a defined vesting period.\n\n## Granting of Stock Awards\n\nAt the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % target attainment  for  each  Managing  Board  member.  This target amount is multiplied using target attainment of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % ('maximum grant amount'). Stock Awards for this maximum grant amount are then granted to the bene ficiary. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by\n\ndividing the maximum grant amount by the price of the Siemens share on the grant date, less the estimated discounted dividends ('grant price'). An approximately four-year vesting period begins with the granting of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. Beneficiaries are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.\n\n## Performance criteria\n\nSince fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the number of Siemens shares that are actually transferred depends /eight.fitted/zero.fitted % on the financial performance criterion 'long-term value creation,' measured on the basis of total shareholder return (TSR), and /two.fitted/zero.fitted % on the non-financial performance criterion 'sustainability.' For measuring the sustainability criterion, Siemens AG's performance in the area of Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) is  assessed on the basis of a Siemens internal ESG / Sustainability  index, the composition of which is determined annually by the Supervisory Board.",

To reflect the Company's international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index.\n\nTarget attainment for TSR is specifically determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the end-of-month\n\nvalues over the first /one.fitted/two.fitted months of the vesting period ( reference  period).\n\nIn order to determine at the end of the vesting period how well the TSR of Siemens AG has performed in comparison to the sector index, the TSR performance value is calculated over the subsequent /three.fitted/six.fitted months (performance period).

If target attainment is less than /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %, a number of Siemens Stock Awards equivalent to the shortfall are forfeited without refund or replacement and an accordingly  reduced number of shares will be transferred.\n\nThe value of the Siemens shares transferred after the expiration of the vesting period is further limited to a maximum of /three.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % of the target amount.

Unlike Stock Awards, Phantom Stock Awards will not be settled by a transfer of shares, but by a cash payment after the expiration of the vesting period. The remaining provisions applicable to the Stock Awards apply analogously.\n\nWith regard to the further terms of the Stock Awards, the same principles apply in general to the Managing Board and to executive employees. These principles are explained  in NOTE /two.fitted/six.fitted in B./six.fitted NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATMENTS .\n\n## MAXIMUM COMPENSATION LIMITS\n\nMaximum compensation is determined annually by the Supervisory Board for each Managing Board member in accordance with Section /eight.fitted/seven.fitted a para. /one.fitted sent. /two.fitted No. /one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz , AktG). Maximum compensation is equal to the sum of the maximum amounts that can be paid out to each Managing Board member for all compensation components for the given fiscal year and is calculated by adding base salary, maximum fringe benefits, BSAV contribution (or cash amount at the member's free disposal) as well as two times the Bonus target amount and three times the Stock Awards target amount.",

        "page_content": "## SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES\n\nUnder the Siemens Share Ownership Guidelines, Managing Board members are obligated to permanently hold Siemens shares of an amount equal to a multiple of their base salary - /three.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % for the President and CEO and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % for the other members of the Managing Board - during their terms of office on the Managing Board, following an initial four-year build-up phase. The average base salary received by each member of the Managing Board in the four years before the applicable verification date is relevant for this purpose.\n\nFulfillment of this obligation must be verified for the first time after the four-year build-up phase and annually thereafter. If share price fluctuations cause the value of the accumulated shareholding to fall below the respective amounts to be verified, the Managing Board member will be obligated to purchase additional shares.\n\n## DEDUCTION OF COMPENSATION FOR MANAGING BOARD MEMBERS' SECONDARY ACTIVITIES\n\nThe acceptance of public offices, seats on supervisory boards (including any committee memberships), boards of directors, advisory boards and comparable bodies and of appointments to scientific bodies are subject to prior approval by the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board. As a rule, approval is not granted for more than two supervisory board positions or comparable functions at listed companies outside the Group. If a Managing Board member holds a supervisory board  position within the Group, the compensation received for such a position will be deducted from his or her Managing Board compensation. If supervisory board positions outside the Group are accepted, the Supervisory Board will decide at its duty-bound discretion on a case-by-case basis whether and to what extent the compensation for such positions is to be deducted. In this context, particular consideration will be given to the extent to which the activity is in the interest of the Company or the Managing Board member.\n\nMemberships on supervisory boards whose establishment is required by law or on comparable domestic or foreign controlling bodies of business enterprises are listed in chapter C./four.fitted./one.fitted MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL STRUCTURE in C./four.fitted CORPORATE GOVERNANCE .\n\n## COMMITMENTS GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMENCEMENT OF MANAGING BOARD APPOINTMENTS OR A CHANGE IN THE REGULAR PLACE OF WORK\n\nUpon the commencement of Managing Board membership or if the regular place of work is changed at the request of the Company, the Supervisory Board will decide on the basis of a proposal by the Compensation Committee whether and to what extent, in addition to the regular fringe benefits, the following compensation and /or benefits will be granted under the Managing Board member's individual employment contract:\n\n## Compensation for the loss of benefits from the previous  employer\n\nDepending on whether the compensation and /or benefits granted by a previous employer (for example, long-term variable compensation grants or pension commitments) are lost by reason of moving to Siemens AG, the Supervisory Board may grant compensation in the form of (usually Phantom) Stock Awards, special contributions within the scope of the BSAV or cash payments.\n\n## Moving expenses\n\nIf the appointment as a member of the Managing Board or a change of the regular place of work at the request of the Company requires the Managing Board member to move to a new residence, moving expenses will be reimbursed up to an appropriate maximum amount to be specified in the individual employment contract.\n\n## COMMITMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE  TERMINATION OF MANAGING BOARD APPOINTMENTS\n\nThe compensation system also governs the amount of compensation a Managing Board member receives if his or her Managing Board appointment is terminated early. Depending on the reason for the termination, the following provisions apply to compensation guaranteed upon departure from office:\n\n## Termination due to regular expiration of term of office\n\nNo severance payments or special pension contributions are made.",

It provides detailed information and background regarding total Managing Board compensation, target setting and target attainment for variable compensation as well as individualized disclosures regarding the compensation of each Managing Board member for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\n## TOTAL COMPENSATION\n\nIn accordance with the applicable accounting principles, the total compensation of all Managing Board members for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted totaled \u20ac /two.fitted/six.fitted./five.fitted/three.fitted million (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted: \u20ac /three.fitted/three.fitted./zero.fitted/four.fitted  million). This amount corresponds to a decrease of /one.fitted/nine.fitted./seven.fitted %. Of total compensation, \u20ac /one.fitted/five.fitted./two.fitted/eight.fitted million (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted: \u20ac /two.fitted/one.fitted./nine.fitted /seven.fitted  million) was attributable to cash compensation and \u20ac /one.fitted/one.fitted./two.fitted/five.fitted million (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted: \u20ac /one.fitted/one.fitted./zero.fitted/seven.fitted million) was attributable to stock-based compensation (Stock Awards).\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, total compensation, excluding fringe benefits, underwent a regular, upward adjustment of /three.fitted./zero.fitted % to the benefit of the target amount for long-term variable\n\ncompensation (Stock Awards). This increase was based, among other things, on adjustments to the compensation of other employee groups within the Siemens Group.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board exercised its option to differentiate the compensation of three members of the Managing Board in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. As in previous years, all components of Joe Kaeser's compensation were differentiated due to his function as President and CEO. The target amount of Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas's Stock Awards was differentiated due to his particular responsibility as CFO. Dr. Roland Busch's base salary and the target amount of his Stock Awards were differentiated due to his appointment as Deputy CEO. Compared to the previous year, this differentiation resulted in an adjustment of Dr. Roland Busch's total compensation, excluding fringe benefits, by /one.fitted/five.fitted % upwards, effective October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. Due to his assumption, among other things, of the  overarching coordi nation of Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure and  Mobility, Dr. Busch's total compensation, excluding fringe  benefits,  was  adjusted  upwards  by  a  further /one.fitted/two.fitted % to the benefit of his base salary and the target amount of his Bonus, effective April /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.",

Of this amount, \u20ac /zero.fitted./zero.fitted/two.fitted million (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted: \u20ac /zero.fitted./zero.fitted/two.fitted million) related to the funding of pension commitments earned prior to the transfer to the BSAV.\n\nThe expense recognized in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted as a service cost under IFRS for Managing Board members' entitlements under the BSAV in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted totaled \u20ac /five.fitted./five.fitted million (/two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted: \u20ac /five.fitted./four.fitted million).\n\nContributions under the BSAV are added to the individual pension accounts in the January following each fiscal year. Until pension payments begin, members' pension accounts are credited with an annual interest payment (guaranteed interest) on January /one.fitted of each year. The interest rate is currently /zero.fitted./nine.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\nThe following table shows the individualized contributions (allocations) under the BSAV for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and the defined benefit obligations for pension commitments:\n\n| (Amounts in \u20ac)                                                                                                              | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted   | Total contri-  butions for /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   | Defined benefit obligation   for all pension commitments   excluding deferred compensation  /one.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   | Defined benefit obligation   for all pension commitments   excluding deferred compensation  /one.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Managing Board members  in office as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted |                                                  |                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Joe Kaeser                                                                                                                  | 1,234,800                                        | 1,234,800                                                                   | 15,592,209                                                                                                                                                                                              | 14,299,267                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Dr. Roland Busch                                                                                                            | 616,896                                          | 616,896                                                                     | 6,566,101                                                                                                                                                                                               | 6,071,233                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Klaus Helmrich                                                                                                              | 616,896                                          | 616,896                                                                     | 7,026,562                                                                                                                                                                                               | 6,473,904                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Cedrik Neike                                                                                                                | 616,896                                          | 616,896                                                                     | 2,938,080                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2,349,895                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Prof. Dr. Ralf P.

For both target setting and target attainment, the average EPS of three consecutive fiscal years is used. The averaged values take account of the Company's long-term performance and provide incentives for a sustainable increase in profit.\n\n## 'Managing Board portfolio' target dimension\n\nFor the 'Managing Board portfolio' target dimension in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG approved the performance criterion 'profitability /capital efficiency,' measured in terms of\n\n- return on capital employed (ROCE) for Managing Board members with primarily functional responsibility or\n- the adjusted EBITA margin of the relevant business for Managing Board members with business responsibility.\n\n## 'Individual targets' target dimension\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned financial targets, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG established four equally weighted 'individual targets' for each Managing Board member for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. These targets are related to the Managing Board members' specific areas of responsibility.\n\nThe individual targets 'successful spin-off of Siemens Energy' and 'achievement of the 'Vision /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted+' goals' were established for all Managing Board members. The performance criterion 'liquidity' measured in terms of the cash conversion rate was also established as an individual target. For the Managing Board members with functional responsibility, the cash conversion rate at the Industrial Businesses is relevant. For the Managing Board members with business responsibility, the cash conversion rate at their respective businesses is relevant. For Klaus Helmrich (Digital Industries) and Cedrik Neike (Smart Infrastructure), a further individual target was the performance criterion 'growth' in the particular business  for  which  they  are  responsible.  The  other individual targets for Managing Board members were defined  on  the  basis  of  the  following  focus  topics: succession planning, innovation performance, business development, employee satisfaction, optimization /efficiency enhancement and the implementation of  other strategic measures.",

The actual amounts paid out are reported under 'Benefits received.'\n\nThe amounts of base salary, the Bonus and fringe benefits relate to fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.\n\nThe respective target amounts for short-term variable compensation (Bonus), including floors and caps, are reported under 'Benefits granted.' The amounts for longterm variable compensation (Stock Awards) granted in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted reflect the fair values on the grant date. The figures for individual maximums for short-term variable compensation (Bonus) and long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards) reflect the possible maximum values in accordance with the maximum amounts defined in the compensation system - that is, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % and /three.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % of the applicable target amounts. Maximum compensation, which is reported in column '/two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (Max)' under 'Total compensation (Code),' represents the contractually agreed upon maximum amount of total compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted in accordance with Section /eight.fitted/seven.fitted a para. /one.fitted sent. /two.fitted No. /one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). For each Managing Board member, maximum compensation equals the sum of the maximum amount of all compensation components for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and is calculated by adding the base salary, maximum fringe benefits, BSAV contribution, twice the Bonus target amount and three times the Stock Awards target amount.\n\nTotal compensation in accordance with the applicable accounting standards is also reported under 'Benefits granted.' According to these accounting standards, this figure includes the amount of short-term variable compensation (Bonus) actually paid, instead of the target amount, and excludes the pension service cost.\n\nThe payments made in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted are reported under 'Benefits received.' The payouts for stock-based compensation refer to the grants for the fiscal years /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted, respectively.",

Fringe benefits granted to Lisa Davis for the period from March /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, to October /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, for payments in connection with the early termination of her appointment and employment contract amounted to \u20ac /six.fitted/eight.fitted/four.fitted,/two.fitted/four.fitted/five.fitted, including contractually agreed tax and currency adjustment.\n- 2 Lisa Davis's compensation was paid out in Germany in euros. It has been agreed that any tax liability that arises due to tax rates that are higher in Germany than in the U. S. will be reimbursed. In addition, a currency adjustment payment was granted for base salary in calendar years /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted as well as for the Bonus for fiscal years /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. Furthermore, Lisa Davis was granted a currency adjustment payment for base salary in calendar year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted as well as for the Bonus for fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted up to the termination date of February /two.fitted/nine.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n- 3 The fringe benefits reported under 'Benefits received' (fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted) include fringe benefits of \u20ac /two.fitted/two.fitted,/two.fitted/eight.fitted/eight.fitted received in October /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted that were, however, granted already in September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted (fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted).\n- 4 In the termination agreement, Lisa Davis was granted an amount of \u20ac /four.fitted/seven.fitted/six.fitted,/nine.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted for the period from October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, until the termination date on February /two.fitted/nine.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, as compensation for her entitlement to a pro-rata Bonus for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Accordingly, the floor and cap applicable to the Bonus did not apply. The amount of \u20ac /four.fitted/seven.fitted/six.fitted,/nine.fitted/six.fitted/two.fitted is therefore reported in the section 'Benefits granted' in column '/two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted' and also in columns '/two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (Min)' and '/two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (Max).'\n- 5 The amount reported under 'Benefits received' includes \u20ac /two.fitted,/two.fitted/three.fitted/six.fitted,/five.fitted/seven.fitted/three.fitted from the settlement of Siemens Stock Awards that were granted to Lisa Davis in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted as compensation for the forfeiture of entitlements granted by her previous employer.\n- 6 Maximum compensation includes the contribution to the Siemens Defined Contribution Pension Plan (BSAV) instead of the pension service cost, see column '/two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (Max).'",

The provisional target attainment for the portion of the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted Stock Awards tranche that is dependent on the Siemens internal ESG / Sustainability index (weighting /two.fitted/zero.fitted %) is /nine.fitted/two.fitted %. According to IFRS, this target attainment results in a reduction of the number of Stock Awards, which has been accounted for in the recognition of expenses. As the provisional target attainment does not provide for any information about the final target attainment or the number of Stock Awards to be transferred after the expiration of the vesting period, the reduction is not reported in the table above. Rather, emphasis is placed on the transparent reporting of the stock-based commitments for the individual members of the Managing Board. At the end of the vesting period, a final number of shares to be transferred is determined based on actual target attainment, taking into account the maximum amount for the Stock Awards.\n- 3 The reported figures include the Stock Awards granted to Cedrik Neike for his position as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Siemens Ltd. China.\n- 4 The number of Stock Awards granted to Michael Sen during fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted includes only the portion of Stock Awards attributable to his membership on the Managing Board.

No additional compensation is paid for work on the Compliance Committee if a member of that committee is already entitled to compensation for work on the Audit Committee.\n\nIf a Supervisory Board member is absent from any Supervisory Board meetings, one-third of the aggregate compensation due to that member is reduced by the percentage of Supervisory Board meetings he or she does not attend in relation to the total number of Supervisory Board meetings held during the fiscal year.

No loans or advances from the Company are provided to members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nUnder Section /one.fitted/one.fitted/three.fitted (/three.fitted) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in the version amended by the German Act Implementing the Second Shareholders' Rights Directive (ARUG II), the annual shareholders' meeting of a listed company must resolve on compensation for the members of the supervisory board at least every four years. Such a resolution is planned for the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted. The current provisions in Section /one.fitted/seven.fitted of Siemens' Articles of Association are to be\n\namended effective October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, and replaced by simplified compensation arrangements.\n\nIn addition, at its meeting on September /two.fitted/three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Supervisory Board decided to reintegrate the Compliance Committee into the Audit Committee. Effective October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the duties that had been transferred to the Compliance Committee were assumed again by the Audit Committee, and the Compliance Committee was thereby dissolved.\n\nThe compensation shown in the following table was determined for each Supervisory Board member for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted

The capital stock is divided into /eight.fitted/five.fitted/zero.fitted million registered shares of no par value (Siemens shares). The shares are fully paid in. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. The shareholders' rights and obligations are governed in detail by the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, in particular by Sections /one.fitted/two.fitted, /five.fitted/three.fitted a et seq., /one.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted et seq. and /one.fitted/eight.fitted/six.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## A.11.2  Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting, each share of stock has one vote and accounts for the shareholder's proportionate share in the Company's net income. An exception to this rule applies with regard to treasury shares held by the Company, which do not entitle the Company to any rights. Under Section /one.fitted/three.fitted/six.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.\n\nSiemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the employee share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/nine.fitted, in particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws provide otherwise. Under the rules of the Share Matching Plan, however, in order to receive one matching share free of charge for each three shares purchased, participants are required to hold the shares purchased by them for a vesting period of several years, during which the participants must be continuously employed by Siemens AG or any of its affiliated companies. The right\n\nto receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting  period.\n\nThe von Siemens-Verm\u00f6gensverwaltung GmbH (vSV) has, on a sustained basis, powers of attorney allowing it to exercise the voting rights for /one.fitted/zero.fitted,/five.fitted/nine.fitted/nine.fitted,/two.fitted/eight.fitted/four.fitted shares (as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted) on behalf of members of the Siemens family. These shares are part of the total number of shares held by the family's members. The powers of attorney are based on an agreement between the vSV and, among others, members of the Siemens family. The shares are voted together by vSV, taking into account the suggestions of a family partnership established by the family's members or of one of this partnership's governing bodies.\n\n## A.11.3  Legislation and provisions of the Articles of Association applicable to the appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board and governing amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nThe appointment and removal of members of the Managing Board are subject to the provisions of Sections /eight.fitted/four.fitted and /eight.fitted/five.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act and Section /three.fitted/one.fitted of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz). According to Section /eight.fitted para. /one.fitted of the Articles of Association, the Managing Board is comprised of several members, the number of which is determined by the Supervisory Board.",

Pursuant to Section /one.fitted/seven.fitted/nine.fitted para. /two.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of Association require a majority of at least three-quarters of the capital stock represented at the time of the casting of the votes, unless another capital majority is prescribed by the Articles of Association.\n\n## A.11.4  Powers of the Managing Board to issue and repurchase shares\n\nThe Managing Board is authorized to increase, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the capital stock until January /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted by up to \u20ac /nine.fitted/zero.fitted million through the issuance of up to /three.fitted/zero.fitted million Siemens shares against contributions in cash (Authorized Capital /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted).

They are, as a matter of principle, to be offered to shareholders for subscription. The Managing Board is authorized to exclude, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, subscription rights of shareholders in the event of capital increases against contributions in kind. In the event of capital increases against contributions in cash, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights with the approval of the Supervisory Board in the following cases:\n\n- The issue price of the new shares / bonds is not significantly lower than the stock market price of the Siemens shares already listed or the theoretical  market price of",

This commitment ends no later than February /four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/five.fitted.\n\nThe Company may not repurchase its own shares unless so authorized by a resolution duly adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting or in other very limited circumstances set forth in the German Stock Corporation Act. On February /five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Shareholders' Meeting authorized the Company to acquire until February /four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/five.fitted up to /one.fitted/zero.fitted % of its capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution or - if this value is lower - as of the date on which the authorization is exercised. The aggregate of shares of stock of Siemens AG repurchased under this authorization and any other Siemens shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable to the Company pursuant to Sections /seven.fitted/one.fitted d and /seven.fitted/one.fitted e of the German Stock Corporation Act may at no time exceed /one.fitted/zero.fitted % of the then existing capital\n\nstock. Any repurchase of Siemens shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Managing Board either (/one.fitted) by acquisition over the stock exchange, (/two.fitted) through a public share repurchase offer or (/three.fitted) through a public offer to swap Siemens shares for shares in a listed company within the meaning of Section /three.fitted para. /two.fitted German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board is additionally authorized to complete the repurchase of Siemens shares in accordance with the authorization described above by using certain derivatives (put and call options, forward purchases and any combination of these derivatives). In exercising this authorization, all stock repurchases based on the derivatives are limited to a maximum volume of /five.fitted % of Siemens' capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution at the Shareholders' Meeting. A derivative's term of maturity may not, in any case, exceed /one.fitted/eight.fitted months and must be chosen in such a way that the repurchase of Siemens shares upon exercise of the derivative will take place no later than February /four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/five.fitted.\n\nIn addition to selling them over the stock exchange or through a public sales offer to all shareholders, the Managing Board is authorized by resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting on February /five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted to also use Siemens shares repurchased on the basis of this or any previously given authorization for every permissible purpose, in particular as follows: Such Siemens shares may be\n\n## retired;\n\n- used in connection with share-based compensation programs and /or employee share programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies and issued to individuals currently or formerly employed by the Company or any of its affiliated companies as well as to board members of any of the Company's affiliated companies;\n- offered and transferred, with the approval of the Super visory Board, to third parties against non-cash contributions;\n- sold by the Managing Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, against payment in cash if the price at which such Siemens shares are sold is not significantly lower than the market price of Siemens stock (exclusion of subscription rights, limited to /one.fitted/zero.fitted % of the capital stock, by mutatis mutandis application",

Moreover, the Managing Board is authorized to exclude subscription rights in order to grant holders / creditors of conversion or option rights or respective conversion or option obligations on Siemens shares subscription rights as compensation against effects of dilution to the extent to which they would be entitled after exercise of such rights or fulfillment of such obligations, and to use Siemens shares to service such subscription rights.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to use shares acquired on the basis of this or any previously given authorization to meet obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares that were or will be agreed with members of the Managing Board within the framework of rules governing Managing Board compensation.\n\nIn November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted, the Company announced that it would carry out a share buyback of up to \u20ac /three.fitted billion in volume until November /one.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted at the latest. The buyback commenced on December /three.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted.

The total consideration paid for these Siemens shares amounted to about \u20ac /two.fitted./four.fitted/zero.fitted/four.fitted billion (excluding incidental transaction charges). This buyback has the exclusive purposes of retirement, of issuing shares to employees, board members of affiliated companies and members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG, and of servicing / securing the obligations or rights to acquire Siemens shares arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds and warrant bonds. The current buyback was suspended as of May /seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted because of the spin-off of Siemens Energy. From May /eight.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, until the completion of the spin-off, Siemens AG conducted a technical share buyback to keep the number of Siemens\n\ntreasury shares constant and, in connection with sharebased compensation and employee stock programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies, to compensate for current transfers of Siemens shares to persons who are or were in an employment relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates, as well as to members of the boards of the Company or any of its affiliated  companies.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Company held /five.fitted/zero.fitted,/six.fitted/nine.fitted/zero.fitted,/two.fitted/eight.fitted/eight.fitted shares of stock in treasury.\n\nFor details on the authorizations referred to above, especially with the restrictions to exclude subscription rights and the terms to include shares when calculating such restrictions, please refer to the relevant resolution and to Section /four.fitted of the Articles of Association.\n\n## A.11.5  Significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens AG maintained lines of credit in the total amount of \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted billion.\n\nIn connection with the planned acquisition of the shares in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. by Siemens Healthineers AG, a consolidated subsidiary of Siemens AG as borrower maintains an undrawn bridge facility in an amount of nearly \u20ac /one.fitted/two.fitted./five.fitted billion guaranteed by Siemens AG as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nIn addition, in March /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and in June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted respectively, a consolidated subsidiary as borrower and Siemens AG as guarantor entered into a bilateral loan agreement, each of which has been drawn in the full amount of US$ /five.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted million.\n\nThe lines of credit, the bridge facility and the loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the event that (/one.fitted) Siemens AG becomes a subsidiary of another  company",

Partially this right of termination exists only, if (/one.fitted) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens AG's obligations under the ISDA Agreements or (/two.fitted) the resulting entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than Siemens AG's immediately prior to such event. Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.\n\n## A.11.6  Compensation agreements with members of the Managing Board or employees in the event of a takeover bid\n\nThe contracts with the members of the Managing Board previously contained the right of the member to terminate his or her contract with the Company for good cause in the event of a change of control that results in a substantial change in the position of a Managing Board member (for example, due to a change in corporate strategy or a change in the Managing Board member's duties and responsibilities). A change of control exists if one or several shareholders acting jointly or in concert acquire a majority of the voting rights in Siemens AG and exercise a controlling influence, or if Siemens AG becomes a dependent enterprise as a result of entering into an intercompany agreement within the meaning of Section /two.fitted/nine.fitted/one.fitted of the German Stock Corporation Act, or if Siemens AG is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity. If this right of termination is exercised, the Managing Board member is entitled to a severance payment in the\n\namount of no more than two years' compensation. The calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base compensation and the target amount for the bonus, but also the target amount for the stock awards, in each case based on the most recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract. The stock-based compensation components for which a firm commitment already exists will remain unaffected. Additionally, the severance payments cover non-monetary benefits by including an amount of /five.fitted % of the total severance amount. Severance payments will be reduced by /one.fitted/zero.fitted % as a lumpsum allowance for discounted values and for income earned elsewhere. However, this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking account of the first six months of the remaining term of the Managing Board member's contract. There is no entitlement to a severance payment if the Managing Board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control. A  right  to  terminate  the  contract  does  not  exist  if the change of control occurs within a period of twelve months prior to a Managing Board member's retirement.\n\nOn  September /one.fitted/eight.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the  Supervisory  Board  of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should not contain such right of termination in the future. This has already been taken into account in the case of a contract extension and in the case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\n## A.11.7  Other takeover-relevant information\n\nWe are not aware of, nor have we during the last fiscal year been notified of, any shareholder directly or indirectly holding /one.fitted/zero.fitted % or more of the voting rights. There are no Siemens shares with special rights conferring powers of control. Shares of stock issued by Siemens AG to employees under its employee share program and /or as share-based compensation are transferred to the employees. The beneficiary employees who hold shares of employee stock may exercise their control rights in the same way as any other shareholder in accordance with applicable laws and the Articles of Association.",

They have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union as well as with the additional requirements set forth in Section /three.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted e (/one.fitted) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The financial statements are in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Managing Board on November /two.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Siemens prepares and reports its Consolidated Financial Statements in euros (\u20ac). Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. Siemens is a German based multinational technology company.\n\n## NOTE /two.fitted Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates\n\nCertain of these accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. Siemens cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens' business and economic environment is adversely affected by the pandemic coronavirus spread, though certain mitigating\n\neffects may arise due to the various measures taken either by the Company, or by Governments and States globally, including favorable financial support. Siemens' fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted orders, revenues and net income are negatively affected by COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted, particularly at our short- cyclic businesses. Impacts from the pandemic vary considerably between regions and customer industries. As the outbreak continues to evolve, it is challenging to predict its duration and its magnitude of impacts on assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows. In the fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company based financial statement related estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available and applied a scenario assuming the current coronavirus situation is of no long-term duration. Consequently, the Company believes its effects on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements will not be of a severe, substantial degree. Corona related impacts on Siemens' Consolidated Financial Statements may result from declining and more volatile share prices, interest rate adjustments in various countries, increasing volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, deteriorating creditworthiness, credit default or delayed payments, delays in order placements as well as in executing orders and contracts, termination of contracts, adjusted or modified revenue and cost patterns, limited usage of assets, volatility in financial and commodity markets, limited or no access to customer facilities and hardship in preparing predictions and forecasts due to uncertainties in amount and timing of cash flows. Those factors may impact fair value and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows. It is reasonably possible, that adjustments to assumptions and carrying amounts are necessary within the next fiscal year. The Company believes assumptions applied appropriately reflect the current situation. See also NOTES /four.fitted and /two.fitted/three.fitted .\n\nBasis of consolidation - The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee.",

        "page_content": "In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of Siemens' return.\n\nBusiness combinations - Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. At the date control is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. In case of a written put option on  non-controlling  interests  the  Company  assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. If the Company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures - Associates are companies over which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of /two.fitted/zero.fitted % to /five.fitted/zero.fitted % of the voting rights). Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control. Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. Siemens' share of its associate's\n\nor joint venture's post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate's or joint venture's profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When Siemens' share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens' net investment in the associate or joint venture.\n\nSiemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its carrying amount. The determination of the recoverable amount includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.\n\nForeign currency translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while the Consolidated Statements of Income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\n\nForeign currency transaction - Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the  underlying  transactions  are  initially  recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued",

Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. Those foreign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.\n\nRevenue recognition - Siemens recognizes revenue when, or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer; i. e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customer's creditworthiness into account. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, the Company reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.\n\nSales from construction-type contracts: Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually /three.fitted/zero.fitted days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory risks, and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.\n\nRevenues from services: Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i. e. under the percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually /three.fitted/zero.fitted days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nSale of goods: Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within /three.fitted/zero.fitted days. For licensing transactions granting the customer a right to use Siemens' intellectual property, payment terms are usually /three.fitted/zero.fitted days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.\n\nIncome from royalties: Royalties are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\nIncome from interest - Interest is recognized using the effective interest method.\n\nFunctional costs - In general, operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers.

Costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS /three.fitted/eight.fitted are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to ten years.\n\nEarnings per share - Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and net income, all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and share-based payment plans.\n\nGoodwill - Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units, generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating unit or the group of cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or the group of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverable amount,\n\nan impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this cashgenerating unit or this group of cash-generating units is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the cash-generating unit's or the group of cash-generating units' fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine both values. These values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.\n\nThe determination of the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit or a group of cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e. g. by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. In determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations use five-year projections that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management's best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.\n\nOther intangible assets - The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents, licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from four to /two.fitted/zero.fitted years for customer relationships and trademarks and for technology from five to /one.fitted/eight.fitted years.",

In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets' recoverable amount, which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.\n\nLeases - Under IFRS /one.fitted/six.fitted, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in NOTES /eight.fitted, /one.fitted/three.fitted and /one.fitted/six.fitted .\n\nLessor - Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. Receivables from finance leases are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLessee - Under IFRS /one.fitted/six.fitted, Siemens recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for short-term and low-value leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. Right-of-use assets are depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.\n\nPrior-year lessee accounting: Until September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, IAS /one.fitted/seven.fitted and IFRIC /four.fitted were applied. Lessee accounting distinguished between finance and operating leases. Finance leases were accounted for largely comparable to the right-of-use model currently applied for lease accounting. Operating leases were recognized off-balance and expensed over the lease term.\n\nDiscontinued operations and non-current assets held for disposal - Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity is classified as held for disposal or has been disposed of, if the component represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for disposal if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations is reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS outside NOTE /three.fitted relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.",

        "page_content": "Income taxes - Tax positions under respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable tax authorities' views can be complex and subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management's considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, including income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning opportunities that Siemens would execute. As of each period-end, Siemens evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens's control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.\n\nContract assets, contract liabilities, receivables - When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a contract asset, a contract liability or a receivable depending on the relationship between Siemens' performance and the customer's payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\nInventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value, costs being generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, technical and price risks.\n\nDefined benefit plans - Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of future salary increases and expected rates of future pension progression are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year's period-end date.\n\nService cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount of the line item Provisions for pensions and similar  obligations  equals  the  DBO.  For  funded  plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets with the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.\n\nRemeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nActuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and",

If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.\n\nProvisions - A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.\n\nSignificant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts, warranty costs, asset retirement obligations, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations (Legal Proceedings). Siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays. Uncertainties regarding asset retirement obligations include the estimated costs of decommissioning and final waste storage because of the long time frame over which future cash outflows are expected to occur including the respective interest accretion. The estimated cash outflows could be impacted significantly by changes of the regulatory environment.\n\nLegal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens' financial position, its results of operations and /or its cash flows.\n\nTermination benefits - Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity's offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entity's decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS /one.fitted/nine.fitted, Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.\n\nFinancial instruments - A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in, financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost, measured at fair value, loan commitments and credit guarantees, contract assets and receivables from finance leases. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. Initially, financial instruments are recognized at fair value and net of transaction costs, if not categorized at FVTPL. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned to:",

Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is elected. b) Financial assets designated as measured at FVTPL: are irrevocably designated at initial recognition if the designation significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were measured on different bases.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost - Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held in a holdto-collect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nValuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses,  representing  a  forward-looking  estimate  of future  credit  losses  involving  significant  judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default. Valuation allowances are not recognized when the gross carrying amount is sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation allowance for loans and\n\nother  long-term  debt  instruments  primarily  held  at Financial Services (SFS) is measured according to a threestage impairment approach:\n\nStage /one.fitted: At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.\n\nStage /two.fitted: If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized based on a lifetime probability of default. A significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage /two.fitted, if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than /three.fitted/zero.fitted days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage /two.fitted, if the delay is not credit-risk-related.\n\nStage /three.fitted: If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial  asset.\n\nFinancial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtor's sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.\n\nA financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset;  for  insignificant  modifications,  the  carrying amount  of  the  financial  asset  is  adjusted  without derecognition.",

Credit guarantees are recognized at the higher of consideration received for granting the guarantee and expected credit losses determined.\n\nFinancial liabilities - except for derivative financial instruments, Siemens measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\nDerivative financial instruments - Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicable deferred income tax). Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.\n\nFair value hedges: The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities that result from meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities.\n\nCash flow hedges: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.\n\nShare-based payment - Share-based payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equity-settled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the market price of the underlying shares, considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and, accordingly, are accounted as equity-settled.\n\nPrior-year information - The presentation of certain prior-year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\n## Recently adopted\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIFRS /one.fitted/six.fitted, Leases, was adopted as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, by applying the modified retrospective approach (using practical and transitional expedients), i. e. comparative figures for the preceding year are not adjusted.

Prior period amounts are not adjusted.\n\n## NOTE /three.fitted Acquisitions, dispositions and discontinued operations\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn October /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Siemens Healthineers acquired Corindus  Vascular  Robotics,  Inc.,  USA,  for  US$ /one.fitted./one.fitted billion (\u20ac /one.fitted./zero.fitted billion) in cash. Corindus develops and provides a robotic-assisted platform for endo-vascular coronary and peripheral vascular interventions. The purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date resulted in Other Intangible assets of \u20ac /three.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted million, mainly relating to acquired technology, and Goodwill of \u20ac /seven.fitted/five.fitted/one.fitted million. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that are not separable, such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. Synergies are expected mainly from offering Corindus' products through the Siemens Healthineers' sales network, and also from the combination of Corindus' robotic systems with Siemens Healthineers' therapy systems and solutions in the fields of digitalization and artificial intelligence. The acquired business contributed revenue of \u20ac /eight.fitted million and a net loss of \u20ac /four.fitted/eight.fitted million for the period from acquisition to September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, including earnings effects from purchase price allocation and integration costs. If Corindus had been included in the consolidated financial statements as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, revenue and net income, including earnings effects from purchase price allocation and integration costs, would have\n\nbeen \u20ac /five.fitted/seven.fitted,/one.fitted/four.fitted/zero.fitted million and \u20ac /four.fitted,/one.fitted/nine.fitted/six.fitted million, respectively, in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nIn November /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Siemens Healthineers acquired /seven.fitted/five.fitted % of ownership interests in ECG Management Consultants (ECG). ECG is a leading consulting company based in the United States specialized in healthcare and providing a comprehensive suite of advisory services. The purchase price paid in cash including adjustments was US$ /two.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted million (\u20ac /one.fitted/nine.fitted/six.fitted million). In addition, Siemens Healthineers redeemed  financial  liabilities  of  ECG  amounting  to US$ /one.fitted/four.fitted/three.fitted million (\u20ac /one.fitted/two.fitted/nine.fitted million). The purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date mainly resulted in Other Intangible assets of \u20ac /one.fitted/one.fitted/two.fitted million, Goodwill of \u20ac /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted million and current financial liabilities of \u20ac /one.fitted/three.fitted/two.fitted million. Goodwill comprises intangible assets that are not separable, such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. Goodwill of \u20ac /nine.fitted/nine.fitted million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nIn addition, Siemens acquired several businesses in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted for a total purchase price of \u20ac /five.fitted/five.fitted/one.fitted million and \u20ac /four.fitted/two.fitted/nine.fitted million, respectively, mainly paid in cash. The (preliminary) purchase price allocations resulted in Other intangible assets of \u20ac /two.fitted/six.fitted/three.fitted million and \u20ac /one.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted million and Goodwill of \u20ac /two.fitted/nine.fitted/eight.fitted million and \u20ac /three.fitted/one.fitted/one.fitted million, respectively, which comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected synergy effects. The purchase price allocation for some of the acquired businesses is preliminary, as a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities has not been finalized. Other intangible assets of \u20ac /one.fitted/four.fitted/five.fitted million and Goodwill of \u20ac /three.fitted/five.fitted million were reclassified to Assets classified as held for disposal subsequently.",

        "page_content": "In August /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens Healthineers entered into an agreement to acquire all shares of Varian Medical Systems, Inc., U. S., for a purchase price of US$ /one.fitted/six.fitted./four.fitted billion (\u20ac /one.fitted/four.fitted./zero.fitted billion as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted). Upon closing of the acquisition, Siemens Healthineers is obliged to repay all amounts outstanding under an existing credit agreement of Varian, which has a maximum volume of US$ /one.fitted./two.fitted billion  (\u20ac /one.fitted./zero.fitted billion).  The  acquisition  was  approved by Varian shareholders in October /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. It is still subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted.\n\n## Acquisition of a further stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy\n\nIn February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens purchased Iberdrola S. A.'s /eight.fitted./one.fitted % stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy for a purchase price of \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion. The transaction was accounted for as equity transaction, resulting in a decrease of non-controlling interests of \u20ac /one.fitted/one.fitted/two.fitted million and a decrease of retained earnings attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG of \u20ac /nine.fitted/six.fitted/seven.fitted million.\n\n## Dilution of the stake in Siemens Healthineers\n\nIn  September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens  Healthineers AG  placed /seven.fitted/five.fitted million new shares to institutional investors, receiving gross proceeds of \u20ac /two.fitted./seven.fitted billion and increasing its share capital to \u20ac /one.fitted./zero.fitted/seven.fitted/five.fitted billion. Siemens did not participate in the placement, thus, Siemens' stake in Siemens Healthineers decreased from /eight.fitted/five.fitted % to /seven.fitted/nine.fitted %. The dilution is accounted for as equity transaction, which increased Non-controlling interests by \u20ac /one.fitted./one.fitted billion and Total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG by \u20ac /one.fitted./six.fitted billion (mainly due to an increase in Retained earnings of \u20ac /one.fitted./five.fitted billion).\n\n## Discontinued operations: Siemens Energy spin-off\n\nIn May /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Siemens announced to transfer the energy business  into  a  new  company,  Siemens  Energy AG (Siemens Energy), and list it on the stock market by a spin-off. The distribution group included the previous segment Gas and Power and the /six.fitted/seven.fitted % stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy. In addition, Siemens transferred a /two.fitted/four.fitted % stake in Siemens Ltd., India, into Siemens Energy. At the end of the second quarter in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted,\n\nthe distribution group met the criteria for a held for disposal and discontinued operation classification. Effective with Siemens classifying the distribution group as held for disposal, Siemens ceased depreciation and amortization of assets within the distribution group. In July /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Siemens AG shareholders approved the spin-off plan in an extraordinary shareholder meeting.\n\nOn September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the spin-off transaction became effective. Siemens transferred /five.fitted/five.fitted % of its ownership interest in Siemens Energy to its shareholders and since that point no longer controls Siemens Energy. Immediately after the effectiveness of the spin-off, Siemens contributed a /nine.fitted./nine.fitted % interest in Siemens Energy to the Siemens Pension-Trust e. V. Thereafter, Siemens owns /three.fitted/five.fitted./one.fitted % in Siemens Energy and accounts for its investment using the equity method.\n\nTo determine the fair value of the spin-off liability and the remaining stake in Siemens Energy as of the spin-off date, Siemens referred to an opinion by an independent expert (level /three.fitted of the fair value hierarchy). The fair value of the spin-off liability, which represents /five.fitted/five.fitted % of the share in Siemens Energy, amounted to \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted./five.fitted billion; the remaining /three.fitted/five.fitted./one.fitted % investment in Siemens Energy amounted to \u20ac /six.fitted./seven.fitted billion and the /nine.fitted./nine.fitted % interest contributed into the Siemens Pension-Trust e. V. amounted to \u20ac /one.fitted./nine.fitted billion; the derecognised net assets, including the non-controlling interests, amounted to \u20ac /one.fitted/six.fitted./zero.fitted billion; the reclassification of the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income resulted in an expense of \u20ac /zero.fitted./seven.fitted billion and the spinoff costs in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted amounted to \u20ac /zero.fitted./two.fitted billion. The transfer of /two.fitted/four.fitted % of Siemens Ltd., India, is classified as an equity transaction not impacting profit or loss at the amount of \u20ac /one.fitted./two.fitted billion; this component is not part of the spin-off gain. Subsequently, Siemens still holds /five.fitted/one.fitted % of the shares in Siemens Ltd., India, and continues to control the investment. As a result of this equity transaction, Non-controlling  interests  and  Retained  earnings  increased by \u20ac /zero.fitted./three.fitted billion and \u20ac /zero.fitted./nine.fitted billion, respectively. Overall, in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens recorded a spin-off gain of \u20ac /zero.fitted./nine.fitted billion. The derecognition of the disposal group is presented as a non-cash transaction. The results of Siemens Energy are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for all periods presented:",

investments accounted for using the equity method included an impairment loss of \u20ac /four.fitted/five.fitted/three.fitted million in connection with an investment that is part of Portfolio Companies. The business situation of the investment, increased development costs of customer projects, combined with a corona-related deterioration of the market environment and contractual obligations triggered an impairment test. The recoverable amount was determined as the investment's fair value less costs to sell using a discounted cash flow approach (level /three.fitted of the fair value hierarchy). In order to determine the recoverable amount, cash flow forecasts were used, taking into account past experience and which represented the best estimate of future developments. The calculation was based on a discount rate (after taxes) of /eight.fitted./zero.fitted %.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens' remaining investment in Siemens Energy AG, active in the transmission and generation of electrical power, is a public listed associate accounted for using the equity method. Below summarized financial information of Siemens Energy AG is disclosed on a /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted per cent basis. It is adjusted to align with Siemens' accounting policies and to incorporate effects from preliminary fair value adjustments at initial recognition.",

        "page_content": "The fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Siemens Financial Services' discount rate represents its specific cost of equity. The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units by taking into account specific\n\npeer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country specific premiums. The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information. The peer group is subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.\n\nThe following table presents key assumptions used to determine fair value less costs to sell for impairment test purposes for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated:\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)              | Goodwill   | Terminal value  growth rate   | Sep /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted After-tax   discount rate   |\n|---------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Digital Industries              | 6,732      | 1.7 %                         | 8.5 %                                                                                                     |\n| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 5,827      | 1.7 %                         | 7.0 %                                                                                                     |\n| Smart Infrastructure            | 2,114      | 1.5 %                         | 7.5 %                                                                                                     |\n\nRevenue figures in the five-year planning period of the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated are based on average\n\nrevenue growth rates (excluding portfolio effects) of between /three.fitted./one.fitted % and /six.fitted./one.fitted % (/two.fitted./three.fitted % and /six.fitted./two.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted).\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)              | Goodwill   | Terminal value  growth rate   | Sep /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted After-tax   discount rate   |\n|---------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gas and Power                   | 7,167      | 1.7 %                         | 8.0 %                                                                                                     |\n| Digital Industries              | 6,807      | 1.7 %                         | 8.5 %                                                                                                     |\n| Imaging of Siemens Healthineers | 5,951      | 1.7 %                         | 6.5 %                                                                                                     |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated was based on a reduction in after-tax future cash flows by /one.fitted/zero.fitted % or an increase in after-tax discount rates by one percentage point or a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by one percentage point.

Siemens' commercial papers have a maturity of generally less than /nine.fitted/zero.fitted days. Interest rates ranged from /zero.fitted./zero.fitted/six.fitted % to /one.fitted./nine.fitted/eight.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and from /one.fitted./eight.fitted/five.fitted % to /two.fitted./seven.fitted/five.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.\n\n## NOTE /one.fitted/seven.fitted Post-employment benefits\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company. Only to a certain extent, those plans are affected by longevity, inflation and compensation increases and take into account country specific differences. The Company's major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. The defined benefit plans cover /four.fitted/four.fitted/four.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted participants, including /one.fitted /seven.fitted /seven.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted actives, /eight.fitted/five.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted deferreds with vested benefits and /one.fitted/eight.fitted/two.fitted,/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted retirees and surviving dependents.\n\n## GERMANY\n\nIn Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans. The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV. Those benefits are predominantly based on notional contributions and their respective asset returns, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.\n\n## U. S.\n\nIn the US, the Siemens Pension Plans are sponsored, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary for the management of the assets of the Plans. The Plans' assets are held in Master Trusts and the trustees of the Master Trusts are responsible for the administration of the assets of the trust, taking directions from the Investment Committee. The Plans are subject to the funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of /one.fitted/nine.fitted /seven.fitted/four.fitted as amended (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of /eight.fitted/zero.fitted % in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At their discretion, sponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries.\n\n## U. K.\n\nPension benefits are mainly offered through the Siemens Benefit Scheme for which, until the start of retirement, an inflation increase of the majority of accrued benefits is mandatory. The required funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based on legal requirements. Due to deviating guidelines for the determination of the discount rates, the technical funding deficit is usually larger than the IFRS funding deficit. To reduce the deficit Siemens entered into an agreement with the trustees to provide annual payments of GB\u00a3 /three.fitted/one.fitted (\u20ac /three.fitted/four.fitted) million until fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/three.fitted/three.fitted. The agreement also provides for a cumulative advance payment by Siemens AG compensating the remaining annual payments at the date of early termination of the agreement due to cancellation or insolvency.\n\n## SWITZERLAND\n\nFollowing the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees. Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by external foundations. The board of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules",

Sensitivities reflect changes in the DBO solely for the assumption changed.\n\n## ASSET LIABILITY MATCHING STRATEGIES\n\nAs a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plans' funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and /or defined benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters. Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching). Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk). The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis under consultation of senior external experts. Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation. Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management.\n\n## DISAGGREGATION OF PLAN ASSETS\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)        | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted   | Sep /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Equity securities         | 5,166                                            | 3,910                                                                           |\n| Fixed income securities   | 13,281                                           | 16,292                                                                          |\n| Government bonds          | 3,727                                            | 5,239                                                                           |\n| Corporate bonds           | 9,555                                            | 11,053                                                                          |\n| Alternative investments   | 4,078                                            | 4,181                                                                           |\n| Multi strategy funds      | 3,154                                            | 3,259                                                                           |\n| Derivatives               | 635                                              | 577                                                                             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 813                                              | 749                                                                             |\n| Other assets              | 2,843                                            | 2,340                                                                           |\n| Total                     | 29,970                                           | 31,307                                                                          |\n\nVirtually all equity securities have quoted prices in active markets.

Order related losses and risks are provided for anticipated losses and risks on uncompleted construction, sales and leasing contracts.\n\nThe Company is subject to asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and equipment. Such asset retirement obligations are primarily attributable to environmental clean-up costs (disclosed in Corporate items of the Segment information) and to costs primarily associated with the removal of leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term.\n\nEnvironmental clean-up costs relate to remediation and environmental protection liabilities which have been accrued based on the estimated costs of decommissioning the site for the production of uranium and mixed-oxide\n\nfuel elements in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as a nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). Whilst in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted, parts of  the  regulation  for  nuclear  waste  disposal  were amended by way of law ('Gesetz zur Neuordnung der Ver antwortung in der kerntechnischen Entsorgung'), Siemens is not covered by these regulations and consequently continues to adhere to the German Atomic Energy Act ('deutsches Atomgesetz') applicable as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, which states that when a nuclear facility is closed, the resulting radioactive waste from decommissioning the nuclear facility must be reprocessed without causing damage and be delivered to a government-approved final storage facility. In this regard, the Company has developed a plan to decommission the Hanau and Karlstein facilities in the following steps: asset retirement (including clean-out, decontamination and disassembly of equipment and installations, decontamination of the facilities and buildings), waste conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage, transport to and final storage of",

This process will be supported by continuing engineering studies and radioactive sampling under the supervision of German federal and state authorities. The decontamination and disassembly at the Karlstein site were completed until the end of calendar year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted, whereas final waste conditioning and packaging is planned to continue until /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/five.fitted. Thereafter, the Company is responsible for intermediate storage of the radioactive materials until they are transported and handed over to a final storage facility. With respect to the Hanau facility, asset retirement is completed and intermediate storage has been set up. On September /two.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted, the Company received official notification from authorities that the Hanau facility has been released from the scope of application of the German Atomic Energy Act and that its further use is unrestricted. The ultimate costs of the remediation are contingent on the decision of the federal government on the location of the final storage facilities and the date of their availability. Several parameters relating to the development of a final storage facility for radioactive waste are based on the assumptions for the so called Schacht Konrad final storage. The valuation uses assumptions to reflect the current and detailed cost estimates, price inflation and discount rates as well as a continuous outflow until the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted/zero.fitted's related to the costs for dismantling as well as intermediate and final storage. The estimated cash outflows related to the asset retirement obligation could alter significantly if political developments affect the government's timeline to finalize the so called Schacht Konrad. To discount cash outflows, the Company uses current interest rates as of the balance sheet date.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the provision totals \u20ac /six.fitted/three.fitted/eight.fitted million and \u20ac /six.fitted/three.fitted/zero.fitted million, respectively, including advance payments to the federal government for the construction of the final storage facility in the amount of \u20ac /nine.fitted/five.fitted million, which are capitalized. The provision is recorded net of a present value discount of \u20ac /seven.fitted/five.fitted million and \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted/three.fitted million, respectively, reflecting the assumed continuous outflow of the total expected payments until the /two.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted/zero.fitted's.\n\nOther  includes  transaction-related  provisions  and post-closing provisions in connection with portfolio activities as well as provisions for Legal Proceedings, as far as the risks that are subject to such Legal Proceedings are not already covered by project accounting. Provisions for Legal  Proceedings  amounted  to  \u20ac /two.fitted/four.fitted/eight.fitted million and \u20ac /four.fitted/zero.fitted /seven.fitted  million as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively.

These rating agencies generally recognize and accept higher levels of debt attributable to captive finance subsidiaries in determining credit ratings. Following this concept, Siemens excludes Siemens Financial Services debt in order to derive an industrial net debt which is not affected by Siemens Financial Services' financing activities.\n- 2 Debt is generally reported at a value representing approximately the amount to be repaid. However, for debt designated in a hedging relationship (fair value hedges), this amount is adjusted for changes in market value mainly due to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, Siemens deducts these changes in market values in order to derive an amount of debt that, approximately, will be repaid.\n\nThe SFS business is capital intensive and operates with a larger amount of debt to finance its operations compared to the industrial business.\n\n| (in millions of \u20ac)              | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted   | Sep /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Allocated equity                | 2,672                                            | 2,864                                                                           |\n| Siemens Financial Services debt | 25,267                                           | 25,959                                                                          |\n| Debt to equity ratio            | 9.46                                             | 9.06                                                                            |",

Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations. The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line. These guarantees have residual terms of up to /six.fitted years in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.

In the event of non-fulfillment of contractual obligations by the primary obligor, Siemens will be required to pay up to an agreedupon maximum amount. These agreements typically have terms of up to ten years. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Performance  guarantees  include  \u20ac /two.fitted/seven.fitted,/six.fitted/eight.fitted/seven.fitted million  for Siemens Energy businesses which were not transferred; however, Siemens has reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the Company accrued \u20ac /one.fitted million and \u20ac /three.fitted million, respectively, relating to performance guarantees.\n\nIn addition to guarantees disclosed in the table above, the Company issued other guarantees. To the extent future claims are not considered remote, maximum future payments from these obligations amount to \u20ac /three.fitted/eight.fitted/seven.fitted million and \u20ac /four.fitted/one.fitted/three.fitted million as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively.

As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the accrued amount for such other commitments is \u20ac /seven.fitted/three.fitted million and \u20ac /one.fitted/four.fitted/six.fitted million, respectively.\n\nSiemens is jointly and severally liable and has capital contribution obligations as a partner in commercial partnerships and as a participant in various consortiums.",

All claims in the case were subsequently dismissed in April /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\n## Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations\n\nAs previously reported, in July /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/eight.fitted, Hellenic Telecommunications  Organization  S. A.  (OTE)  filed  a  lawsuit against Siemens AG with the district court of Munich, Germany, seeking to compel Siemens AG to disclose the outcome of its internal investigations with respect to OTE. OTE seeks to obtain information with respect to allegations of undue influence and /or acts of bribery in  connection  with  contracts  concluded  between Siemens AG and OTE from calendar year /one.fitted/nine.fitted/nine.fitted/two.fitted to /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted. At the end of July /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/zero.fitted, OTE expanded its claim and requested payment of damages by Siemens AG of at least \u20ac /five.fitted/seven.fitted million to OTE for alleged bribery payments to OTE employees. In October /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted, OTE increased its damage claim to the amount of at least \u20ac /six.fitted/eight.fitted million. Siemens AG continues to defend itself against the expanded claim.\n\nAs previously reported, in September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/one.fitted, the Israeli Antitrust Authority requested that Siemens present its legal position regarding an alleged anti-competitive arrangement between April /one.fitted/nine.fitted/eight.fitted/eight.fitted and April /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/four.fitted in the field of gas-insulated switchgear. In September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/three.fitted, the Israeli Antitrust Authority concluded that Siemens AG was a party to an illegal restrictive arrangement regarding the Israeli gas-insulated switchgear market between /one.fitted/nine.fitted/eight.fitted/eight.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/four.fitted, with an interruption from October /one.fitted/nine.fitted/nine.fitted/nine.fitted to February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted. The Company appealed against this decision in May /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted.\n\nBased on the above mentioned conclusion of the Israeli Antitrust Authority, two electricity consumer groups filed motions to certify a class action for cartel damages against a number of companies including Siemens AG with an Israeli State Court in September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/three.fitted. One of the class actions has been dismissed by the court in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted. The remaining class action seeked compensation for alleged damages amounting to ILS/two.fitted./eight.fitted billion. In addition, the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) filed at the end of December /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/three.fitted with an Israeli State Court a  separate  ILS/three.fitted./eight.fitted billion  claim  for  damages  against Siemens AG and other companies that allegedly formed a cartel in the Israeli gas-insulated switchgear market. A settlement agreement was concluded in those proceedings in December /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted and has been approved by the Israeli State Court in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Following payment of a mid double-digit million euro figure in July /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the matter was finally settled.\n\nAs previously reported, in May /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/four.fitted, the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo initiated a lawsuit against Siemens Ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL/two.fitted./five.fitted billion (approximately \u20ac /three.fitted/seven.fitted/seven.fitted million as of September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/eight.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/one.fitted. In January /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo and two customers against Siemens Ltda., Siemens AG and other companies and individuals claiming damages in an unspecified amount. In March /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted",

In September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted, the district court of S\u00e3o Paulo admitted another lawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico) S\u00e3o Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and other companies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL/nine.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted million (approximately \u20ac /one.fitted/three.fitted/nine.fitted million as of September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted) plus adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts entered into in /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/six.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/seven.fitted. Siemens is defending itself against these actions. It cannot be excluded that further significant damage claims will be brought by customers or the state against Siemens.\n\nAs previously reported, in June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in  public  tenders  and  signing  contracts  with  public administrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar year /one.fitted/nine.fitted/nine.fitted/nine.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted/four.fitted in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted, the appeal was rejected. Siemens Ltda. has introduced another remedy against the decision. In June /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted, the court accepted Siemens' appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. Siemens Ltda. is currently not excluded from participating in public tenders. In February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted, the Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico in Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set of facts, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a ten year term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit.\n\nSiemens is involved in numerous Legal Proceedings in various jurisdictions. These Legal Proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further Legal Proceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending Legal Proceedings may be extended. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.\n\nSome of these Legal Proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens, which may have material effects on its business activities as well as its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFor Legal Proceedings information required under IAS /three.fitted/seven.fitted, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not disclosed if the Company concludes that disclosure can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the matter.",

Fair value of debt instruments, is either based on prices provided by price service agencies or is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates.\n\nFair values of derivative financial instruments are determined in accordance with the specific type of instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument. Interest rate futures are valued based on quoted market prices, if available. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates. Options are generally valued based on quoted market prices or based on option pricing models. No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e. g. firm commitments and forecast transactions) are considered.\n\nThe Company limits default risks resulting from derivative financial instruments by generally transacting with financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of investment grade. Based on Siemens' net risk exposure towards the counterparty, the resulting credit risk is taken into account via a credit valuation adjustment.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Level /three.fitted financial assets include venture capital investments of \u20ac /three.fitted/eight.fitted/six.fitted million and \u20ac /two.fitted/nine.fitted/one.fitted million (Next/four.fitted/seven.fitted investments).

Reclassifications of foreign currency risk hedges with operative business purposes are presented as functional costs. Costs of hedging reserve is the forward element of forward contracts that are not designated as hedge accounting and which are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis as the hedged item is time-period related.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk management\n\n## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP\n\nThe Company manages its risks associated with fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  denominated  receivables, payables, debt, firm commitments and forecast transactions primarily through a Company-wide portfolio approach. Under this approach the Company-wide risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and options, are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company also accounts for foreign currency derivatives, which are embedded in sale and purchase contracts.\n\n## CASH FLOW HEDGES\n\nThe Company's operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk mainly results from contracts denominated in US$ both from Siemens' operating units entering into long-term contracts e. g. from the project business, from the standard product business and, additionally, Siemens AG entered into a deal contingent forward with a nominal amount of \u20ac /seven.fitted,/five.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted million to hedge exchange risks arising from a part of the purchase price obligation for the planned Siemens Healthineers acquisition of Varian Medical Systems Inc. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the risk is hedged against the euro at an average rate of /one.fitted./two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/three.fitted \u20ac / US$ and /one.fitted./one.fitted/nine.fitted/seven.fitted/two.fitted \u20ac / US$ (forward purchases of US$), respectively and /one.fitted./one.fitted/nine.fitted/five.fitted/zero.fitted \u20ac / US$ and /one.fitted./two.fitted/five.fitted/four.fitted/seven.fitted \u20ac / US$ (forward sales\n\nof US$). As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the hedging transactions have an average remaining maturity until /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (forward purchases of US$) as well as /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted (forward sales of US$).\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\n## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP\n\nInterest rate risk management relating to the Group, excluding SFS' businesses, uses derivative financial instruments under a portfolio-based approach to manage interest risk actively relative to a benchmark. Interest rate management of the SFS and businesses remains to be managed separately, considering the term structure of SFS' financial assets and liabilities on a portfolio basis. Neither approach qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. Net cash receipts and payments in connection with interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expense in Other financial income (expenses), net.\n\n## CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FLOATING-RATE COMMERCIAL PAPERS\n\nSiemens applies cash flow hedge accounting to a revolving portfolio of floating-rate commercial papers of nominal US$ /seven.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted million. Siemens pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate of interest, offsetting future changes in interest payments of the underlying floating-rate commercial papers. Net cash receipts and payments are recorded as interest expenses. The Company had interest rate swap contracts to receive variable rates of interest of an average of /zero.fitted./two.fitted/three.fitted % and /two.fitted./one.fitted/one.fitted % as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively, and paid fixed rates of interest (average rate of /one.fitted./nine.fitted/five.fitted % and /one.fitted./nine.fitted/five.fitted %, as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively).\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS\n\nUnder interest rate swap agreements outstanding in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the Company agreed to pay a variable rate of interest multiplied by a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest multiplied by the same notional principal amount. These interest rate swap agreements offset future changes in interest rates designated as hedged risk on the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt obligations. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the carrying amounts of \u20ac /six.fitted,/nine.fitted/three.fitted/eight.fitted million and \u20ac /seven.fitted,/zero.fitted/five.fitted/zero.fitted million,",

This changed /one.fitted/eight.fitted % and /two.fitted/two.fitted % of the Company's underlying notes and bonds from fixed interest rates into variable interest rates as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively.  The  notional amounts of these contracts mature at varying dates based on the maturity of the underlying hedged items. The net fair value of interest rate swap contracts (excluding accrued interest) used to hedge indebtedness as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted was \u20ac /five.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted million and \u20ac /four.fitted/two.fitted/eight.fitted million, respectively.\n\n## NOTE /two.fitted/five.fitted Financial risk management\n\nIncreasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for Siemens. The Company's operating business as well as its investment and  financing  activities  are  affected  particularly  by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across Siemens' segments and entities, as well as to achieve its aims, Siemens identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks. The Company seeks to\n\nmanage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.\n\nIn order to quantify market risks Siemens has implemented a system based on Value at Risk (VaR), which is also used for internal management of Corporate Treasury activities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a /nine.fitted/nine.fitted./five.fitted % confidence level.\n\nActual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamental conceptual differences. While the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss, which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of /nine.fitted/nine.fitted./five.fitted %. Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A /nine.fitted/nine.fitted./five.fitted % confidence level means that there is a /zero.fitted./five.fitted % statistical probability that losses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating the statistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios, especially those of an exceptional nature.\n\nAny market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest-bearing investments that our Company's pension plans hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk TRANSACTION RISK\n\nEach Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business, Siemens",

        "page_content": "units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U. S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.\n\nOperating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis. Intercompany financing or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.\n\nAccording to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. The net foreign currency position of Siemens units serves as a central performance measure and has to be hedged within a band of at least /seven.fitted/five.fitted % but no more than /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %.\n\nGenerally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury. By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the VaR relating to foreign currency exchange rates was \u20ac /nine.fitted/zero.fitted million and \u20ac /seven.fitted/nine.fitted  million. This VaR was calculated under consideration of items of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in addition to firm commitments, which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currency denominated cash flows from forecast transactions for the following twelve months. The increase in the VaR resulted mainly from a higher net foreign currency position after hedging activities.\n\n## TRANSLATION RISK\n\nMany Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. To consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based\n\noperations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Company's consolidated equity position.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Company's position with regard to interest rate risk, interest income and interest expenses, Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk relating to the Group, excluding SFS' business, is mitigated by managing interest rate risk actively relatively to a benchmark. The interest rate risk relating to SFS' business is managed separately, considering the term structure of financial assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate risk results primarily from funding in the U. S. dollar, British pound and euro.\n\nIf there are no conflicting country-specific regulations, all Siemens operating units generally obtain any required financing through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the VaR relating to the interest rate was \u20ac /four.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted million and \u20ac /seven.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted million. The decrease was driven mainly by lower interest rate volatilities, in particular for the U. S. dollar and the euro.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk results from the Company's inability to meet its financial liabilities. Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Siemens mitigates liquidity risk by the implementation of effective working capital and cash management, arranged credit facilities with highly rated financial institutions, via a debt issuance program and",

Hence, credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.\n\nThe effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.\n\nSiemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which  numerous  operating  units  from  the  Siemens Group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency.\n\nRatings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens' credit default experiences. Internal ratings consider appropriate forward-looking information relevant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the debtor's financial position, ownership, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry-related and competitive developments. The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. Ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as Siemens' public and private customers, which are determined by internal risk assessment specialists, are continuously updated and considered for investments in cash and cash equivalents and in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.",

        "page_content": "An exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than /nine.fitted/zero.fitted days past due, or a default rating by an external rating agency.\n\nTo analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes. A main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.\n\nThe carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial asset's credit risk, without taking account of any collateral. Collateral reduces the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific, identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account. Those collaterals are mostly held in the portfolio of SFS.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, collateral of \u20ac /eight.fitted/two.fitted/nine.fitted million and \u20ac /eight.fitted/three.fitted/five.fitted million, respectively, relate to financial assets measured at fair value. Those collaterals are provided in connection with netting agreements for derivatives providing protection from the risk of a counterparty's insolvency. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, collateral held for credit-impaired receivables from finance leases amounted to \u20ac /one.fitted/four.fitted/one.fitted million and \u20ac /five.fitted/five.fitted million, respectively. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, collateral held for financial assets measured at amortized cost amounted to \u20ac /four.fitted,/one.fitted/zero.fitted/nine.fitted million and \u20ac /three.fitted,/nine.fitted/four.fitted/eight.fitted million, respectively, including \u20ac /one.fitted/four.fitted/one.fitted million and \u20ac /eight.fitted/six.fitted million, respectively, for credit-impaired loans in SFS' asset finance business.

These investments are monitored based on their current market value, affected primarily by fluctuations on the volatile technology-related markets worldwide. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the market value of Siemens' portfolio, which mainly consists of one investment in a publicly traded company, was \u20ac /one.fitted,/zero.fitted/five.fitted/five.fitted million.

Share-based payment awards may forfeit if the employment of the beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, expense from equity-settled awards on a continuing basis are \u20ac /two.fitted/nine.fitted/eight.fitted million and \u20ac /two.fitted/five.fitted/zero.fitted million; cashsettled awards on a continuing basis resulted in gains (expenses) of \u20ac(/two.fitted/six.fitted) million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and \u20ac /two.fitted/four.fitted million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.\n\nIn connection with the Siemens Energy spin-off, sharebased payment arrangements were altered in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. To address an expected dilution from the spin off, beneficiaries remaining with Siemens receive at the date of transfer, in addition to Siemens shares, a compensating cash payment based on the spin-off ratio /two.fitted:/one.fitted and based on the Siemens Energy share price at vesting. Due to the modifications of the underlying stock awards and matching shares, \u20ac /five.fitted/five.fitted million were reclassified from equity to liabilities as of July /nine.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, and thereby recognized as cash-settled share-based payment plan, taking into account the proportionate vesting period passed. In connection with the spin-off, beneficiaries leaving Siemens and joining Siemens Energy no longer participate in the stock award and share matching programs. Related Siemens  obligations  were  settled,  the  beneficiaries received a compensating cash payment from Siemens Energy following the spin-off.\n\n## Stock Awards\n\nThe Company grants stock awards to members of the Managing Board, members of the senior management and other eligible employees. Stock awards are subject to a restriction period of about four years and entitle the beneficiary to Siemens shares following the restriction period without payment of consideration.\n\nStock awards are tied to performance criteria. For stock awards granted in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, /eight.fitted/zero.fitted % of the target amount is linked to the relative total shareholder return of Siemens compared to the total shareholder return of the MSCI World Industrials sector index (TSR-Target) during a fouryear restriction period; the remaining /two.fitted/zero.fitted % are linked to a\n\nSiemens internal sustainability target considering environmental, social and governance targets (ESG- Target). The annual target amount for stock awards up to and including tranche /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted is linked to the share price performance of Siemens relative to the share price performance of five important competitors during the four-year restriction period. The target attainment for each individual performance criteria ranges between /zero.fitted % and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted %. For awards granted since fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted settlement is in shares only corresponding to the actual target attainment. Awards granted prior to fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, target outperformances in excess of /one.fitted/zero.fitted/zero.fitted % are settled in cash. The vesting period is four years.\n\n## COMMITMENTS TO MEMBERS OF THE MANAGING BOARD\n\nMost of the Managing Board's stock awards are based on criteria described above. Fair values are \u20ac /one.fitted/two.fitted million and \u20ac /one.fitted/one.fitted million, respectively, in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, calculated by applying a valuation model. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, inputs to that model include, for the majority of the stock awards granted, an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of /two.fitted/one.fitted./five.fitted/eight.fitted % and /two.fitted/one.fitted./seven.fitted/two.fitted %, respectively, and a market price of \u20ac /one.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted./eight.fitted/zero.fitted and \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted./four.fitted/two.fitted per Siemens share. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (/zero.fitted./two.fitted/four.fitted) % and /zero.fitted./one.fitted/four.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively, and an expected dividend yield of /three.fitted./three.fitted/one.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /three.fitted./seven.fitted/one.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted.

In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, inputs to that model include an expected weighted volatility of Siemens shares of /two.fitted/one.fitted./five.fitted/eight.fitted % and /two.fitted/one.fitted./seven.fitted/three.fitted %, respectively, and a market price of \u20ac /one.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted./zero.fitted/two.fitted and \u20ac /nine.fitted/eight.fitted./nine.fitted/two.fitted per Siemens share. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to (/zero.fitted./two.fitted/six.fitted)  % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and up to /zero.fitted./one.fitted/six.fitted in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted and an expected dividend yield of /three.fitted./three.fitted/one.fitted % and /three.fitted./eight.fitted/four.fitted % in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and a) the development of the MSCI Index in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted respectively b) the share prices of the competitor basket in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, fair value of the ESG component of \u20ac /nine.fitted/eight.fitted./zero.fitted/two.fitted per share was determined as the market price of Siemens shares less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.\n\nChanges in the stock awards held by members of the senior management and other eligible employees are:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted   | Fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-vested, beginning of period                                                                                                                                                                                    | 8,742,219                                        | 6,641,400                                                    |\n| Granted                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 3,360,531                                        | 3,751,556                                                    |\n| Vested and fulfilled                                                                                                                                                                                               | (1,733,082)                                      | (603,572)                                                    |\n| Adjustments due to vesting conditions   other than market conditions                                                                                                                                               | (351,339)                                        | -                                                            |\n| Forfeited                                                                                                                                                                                                          | (412,903)                                        | (386,041)                                                    |\n| Modified                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -                                                | (643,619)                                                    |\n| Settled (thereof /two.fitted,/two.fitted/nine.fitted/three.fitted,/nine.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted in   connection with the Siemens Energy spin-off   in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted) | (2,303,850)                                      | (17,505)                                                     |\n| Non-vested, end of period                                                                                                                                                                                          | 7,301,576                                        | 8,742,219                                                    |\n\n## Share Matching Program and its underlying plans\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens issued a new tranche under each of the plans of the Share Matching Program.\n\n## SHARE MATCHING PLAN\n\nUnder the Share Matching Plan, senior managers may invest a specified part of their variable compensation in Siemens shares (investment shares). The shares are purchased at the market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens until the end of the vesting period.\n\n## MONTHLY INVESTMENT PLAN\n\nUnder the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified part of their compensation in Siemens shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelve months. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a month. If the Managing Board decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Plan are transferred to the Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above with a vesting period of about two years. The Managing Board decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/eight.fitted are transferred to the Share Matching Plan as of February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and February /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively.\n\n## BASE SHARE PROGRAM\n\nUnder the Base Share Program employees of Siemens AG and participating domestic Siemens companies may invest a fixed amount of their compensation in Siemens shares, sponsored by Siemens. The shares are bought at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter and grant the right to receive matching shares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above. The fair value of the Base Share Program amounted to \u20ac /three.fitted/three.fitted million and \u20ac /three.fitted/three.fitted million in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, respectively.",

- includes the Company's pension related income (expense) not allocated to the segments, POC or Siemens Real Estate.\n\n## Eliminations, Corporate Treasury and other reconciling\n\nitems - comprise consolidation of transactions within the segments, certain reconciliation and reclassification items as well as central financing activities. It also includes interest income and expense, such as, for example, interest not allocated to segments or POC (referred to as financing interest), interest related to central financing activities or resulting consolidation and reconciliation effects on interest.\n\n## Measurement - Segments\n\nAccounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment information is disclosed for continuing operations; prior year Assets are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. For internal and segment reporting purposes intercompany lease transactions, however, are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for off-balance sheet by  the  lessee  (except  for  intercompany  leases  with Siemens Healthineers and Mobility as lessees). Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.\n\n## REVENUE\n\nRevenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, lease revenue is \u20ac /nine.fitted/one.fitted/six.fitted million and \u20ac /seven.fitted/nine.fitted/five.fitted million, respectively. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, Digital industries recognized \u20ac /four.fitted,/one.fitted/four.fitted/four.fitted million and \u20ac /four.fitted,/zero.fitted/three.fitted/nine.fitted million revenue, respectively, from its software business, Smart Infrastructure recognized \u20ac /five.fitted,/two.fitted/two.fitted/four.fitted million and \u20ac /five.fitted,/five.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted million in its product business. Revenues of Mobility are mainly derived from construction-type business.\n\n## PROFIT\n\nSiemens' Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments (chief operating decision maker). The Company's profitability measure of the segments except for SFS is earnings before financing interest, certain pension costs, income taxes and amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker (Profit). The major categories of items excluded from Profit are presented below.\n\nFinancing interest, excluded from Profit, is any interest income or expense other than interest income related to receivables from customers, from cash allocated to the segments and interest expenses on payables to suppliers. Financing interest is excluded from Profit because decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.",

        "page_content": "Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.\n\nAmortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations are not part of Profit. Furthermore, income taxes are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit, if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, SRE and (or) POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.\n\n## PROFIT OF THE SEGMENT SFS\n\nIn contrast to performance measurement principles applied to other segments, interest income and expenses are included, since interest is an important source of revenue and expense of SFS.\n\n## ASSET MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES\n\nManagement determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of the segments except for SFS. Its definition corresponds to the Profit measure except for amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not part of Profit, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments' Assets. Segment Assets is based on Total assets of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, primarily excluding intragroup financing receivables, tax related assets and assets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from Profit. The remaining assets are reduced by non-interest-bearing liabilities other than tax related liabilities, e. g. trade payables, to derive Assets. In contrast, Assets of SFS is Total assets. In individual cases assets of Mobility include project-specific intercompany financing  of  long-term  projects.  Assets  of  Siemens Healthineers includes real estate, while real estate of all other Siemens segments is carried at SRE, except for carved-out real estate of Mobility.\n\n## ORDERS\n\nOrders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens considers termination rights and customer's creditworthiness.\n\nAs of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted and /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, order backlog totaled \u20ac /seven.fitted/zero.fitted billion and \u20ac /six.fitted/nine.fitted billion (continuing operations); thereof Digital Industries \u20ac /five.fitted billion and \u20ac /five.fitted billion, Smart Infrastructure \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted billion and \u20ac /one.fitted/zero.fitted billion, Mobility \u20ac /three.fitted/two.fitted billion and \u20ac /three.fitted/three.fitted billion and Siemens Healthineers \u20ac /one.fitted/eight.fitted billion and \u20ac /one.fitted/eight.fitted billion. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/one.fitted, Siemens expects to convert approximately \u20ac /two.fitted/eight.fitted billion of the September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted order backlog into revenue; thereof at Digital Industries approximately \u20ac /four.fitted billion, Smart Infrastructure approximately \u20ac /seven.fitted billion, Mobility approximately \u20ac /eight.fitted billion and Siemens Healthineers approximately \u20ac /six.fitted billion.\n\n## FREE CASH FLOW DEFINITION\n\nFree cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Except for SFS, it excludes financing interest, except for cases where interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it also excludes income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds. Free cash flow of SFS includes related financing interest payments and proceeds; income tax payments and proceeds of SFS are excluded. In individual cases, free cash flow of Mobility includes project-specific intercompany financing of longterm projects.\n\n## AMORTIZATION, DEPRECIATION AND IMPAIRMENTS\n\nAmortization, depreciation and impairments includes depreciation and impairments of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net of reversals of impairment.",

In addition, in accordance with Art. /one.fitted/zero.fitted (/two.fitted) f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Art. /five.fitted (/one.fitted) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted to September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n## SPIN-OFF OF THE SIEMENS ENERGY BUSINESS\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The spin-off and public listing of the Siemens Gas and Power business, which was made a legally independent entity under Siemens Energy AG prior to the spin-off, including the shares previously held by the Siemens Group comprising an interest of around /six.fitted /seven.fitted % in the listed company Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S. A., Spain, and its subsidiaries ('SGRE') (hereinafter 'Siemens Energy Business'), was completed at the end of September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. As consideration for the spinoff, Siemens AG transferred /five.fitted/five.fitted % of the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG existing after the spin-off capital increase and in-kind capital increase to the shareholders of Siemens AG. The remaining /four.fitted/five.fitted % of the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG was initially held by Siemens AG and a wholly owned subsidiary when the spin-off became effective. A share of /nine.fitted./nine.fitted % of Siemens Energy AG's capital stock was transferred by Siemens AG as a contribution to Siemens Pension-Trust e. V., Germany, in connection with the spin-off.\n\nThe accounting for the spin-off of the Siemens Energy Business was a key audit matter due to the complexity of the transaction and the associated significant risk of material misstatement, the estimation uncertainties and judgment involved in the measurements performed as well as the overall significant impact on the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. First of all, the classification of the Siemens Energy Business as assets held for sale and as discontinued operations since March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted was of key significance for our audit due to the complexity. In addition, the recognition of the spin-off liability pursuant to IFRIC /one.fitted/seven.fitted, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners , its measurement as of September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, and the disposal of this spin-off liability and of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities held for sale as well as the addition of the /four.fitted/five.fitted % investment in Siemens Energy AG, including the recognition of the difference as a spin-off result in the income statement, is subject to a significant risk due to the complexity of the measurements.\n\nAuditor's response: As part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we first evaluated management's assessment of fulfillment of the criteria pursuant to IFRS /five.fitted, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , for classification as held for sale and discontinued operations as of March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. For this purpose, we obtained an understanding of the planned contractual agreements and examined the probability of the shareholders giving their approval at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting, the progress of the carve-outs of the Siemens Gas and Power Business and the decisions by corporate bodies on the capitalization of the spin-off group. In addition, we evaluated the planned legal execution of the spin-off including the Deconsolidation Agreement as to whether the requirements of commercial and stock corporation law are fulfilled with regard to the loss of control and thus the deconsolidation of the Siemens Energy Business when the spin-off becomes effective pursuant to IFRS /one.fitted/zero.fitted, Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nWe also evaluated the identification of the business activities falling within the scope of IFRS /five.fitted using the underlying contracts and assessed the implementation of the classification as held for sale and as discontinued operations in the consolidation system, including adjustments",

In addition, we evaluated the methodology and the valuation models for performing the impairment tests with the assistance of internal specialists who have expertise in business valuation. We also assessed the stated future cash inflows by, among other procedures, comparing this information against the five-year plan prepared by management as well as by comparing the internal growth and earnings forecasts with general and industry-specific market expectations and significant competitors. In addition, we examined the underlying assumptions and parameters, walked through the sensitivity analyses prepared by management and performed supplementary sensitivity analyses of our own to account for the existing forecast uncertainties.\n\nIn connection with the recognition of the spin-off liability, we assessed the methodology of the independent expert engaged by management, the valuation models applied and the assumptions and estimates subject to judgment used in determining the fair value of the spinoff liability pursuant to IFRIC /one.fitted/seven.fitted, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners , drawing on the expertise of our valuation specialists and taking into account the audit evidence obtained from the abovementioned impairment tests. This also included assessing the appropriateness as audit evidence of the expert opinion commissioned by management from an independent expert.\n\nFinally, we examined the accounting for the disposal of the remeasured spin-off liability and the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities held for sale as well as the addition of the /four.fitted/five.fitted % investment in Siemens Energy AG\n\nand the subsequent contribution of /nine.fitted./nine.fitted % to Siemens Pension-Trust e. V. and their presentation in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit procedures particularly included assessing the determination of the fair value of the spin-off liability and of the investment held in Siemens Energy AG as an associate as of September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted on the basis of the opinion prepared by the independent expert and the calculation of the disposal result. Additional audit procedures were performed related to management's assessment of the recoverability of the /three.fitted/five.fitted./one.fitted % investment in Siemens Energy accounted for as an associate as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nIn addition, drawing on the expertise of IT specialists, we evaluated the IT related implementation of the deconsolidation in the consolidation systems as well as the methodological, mathematical and accounting approach to the derecognition calculation in accordance with IFRS /one.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the disclosures on the spinoff of the Siemens Energy Business provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the spin-off of the Siemens Energy Business.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the spin-off of the Siemens Energy Business, refer to NOTE /two.fitted MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. An explanation of the transaction and disclosures on the deconsolidation and spin-off result are presented in NOTE /three.fitted ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION ON CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group conducts a significant portion of its business in continuing and discontinued operations under construction contracts, particularly in the Gas and Power business and at Siemens Gamesa  Renewable Energy (until the spin-off became effective) as well as in the Mobility business. Revenue from long-term construction contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS /one.fitted/five.fitted, Revenue from",

        "page_content": "Contracts with Customers , generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method. We consider the accounting for construction contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement (including the potential risk of management override of internal controls) and accordingly a key audit matter, because management's assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include, in particular, the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations, total estimated contract costs, remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues, as well as contract risks including technical, political, regulatory and legal risks. Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction contract. Furthermore, in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted the effects of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted) on the project business, such as delays in project execution due to access restrictions at customer sites or short-term interruptions to supply chains as well as the invocation of force majeure or change in law clauses with regard to compensation for damages or contractual penalties for delays in delivery and their accounting treatment were of key significance for our audit.\n\nAuditor's response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding  of  the  Group's  internally  established methods, processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction contracts. In this regard, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of business transactions specific to construction contracts, from the initiation of the transaction through presentation in the consolidated financial statements. We also tested internal controls on management level including project reviews and controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates and the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation.\n\nAs part of our substantive audit procedures, we evaluated management's estimates and assumptions based on a riskbased selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample particularly included projects that are subject to significant\n\nfuture uncertainties and risks, such as fixed-price or turnkey projects, projects with complex technical requirements or with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers, subcontractors or consortium partners, cross-border projects, projects in regions particularly affected by the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic and projects with changes in cost estimates, delays and /or low or negative margins. Our audit procedures included, among others, review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services,  termination  rights,  penalties  for  delay  and breach of contract as well as liquidated damages. In order to evaluate whether revenues were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects, we analyzed billable revenues and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income in the reporting period considering the extent of progress towards completion, and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position. Considering the requirements of IFRS /one.fitted/five.fitted, we also assessed the accounting for contract amendments or contractually agreed options. We further performed inquiries of project management (both commercial and technical project managers) with respect to the development of the projects including the effects of COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted on project execution, the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs, the current estimated costs to complete the projects, and management's assessments on probabilities that contract risks will materialize. To identify anomalies in the development of margins throughout the projects' execution, we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures, we also considered results from project  audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects (e. g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyers' confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims) and inspected plant and project locations.\n\nDue to the large contract volume and risk profile, in particular with respect to the developments of the power generation markets, our audit procedures especially focused on large contracts for the turnkey construction of power plants, high-voltage-direct-current solutions, the delivery of high-speed and commuter trains, and the construction of onshore and offshore wind farms.",

These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they frequently involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks. The uncertainties and estimates with respect to asset retirement obligations pertain especially to the estimated costs of interim and final nuclear waste storage, the estimated time frame over which cash outflows are expected, and the relevant discount rates.\n\nAuditor's response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted are known and to assess\n\nmanagement's estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Group entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.\n\nWe further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations and internal company policies (compliance violations) by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed whether any risks have to be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on the aforementioned uncertainties, our audit procedures with respect to asset retirement obligations focused on the remediation and environmental protection liabilities in connection with the decommissioning of the facilities in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for the nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). Our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the estimated costs for the construction, operation and decommissioning of the final storage facility, the appropriateness as audit evidence of an independent expert's report commissioned by management with regard to the estimated price inflation, evaluating the valuation methods used by drawing on the expertise of our valuation specialists, and assessing the significant estimates resulting from the long-term nature of the related obligations. Through inquiries of persons entrusted with the matter and inspections of internal and external documents, we evaluated management's assessment whether, as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, Siemens continues to be subject to the German Atomic Energy Act ('Atomgesetz'), whereby radioactive waste",

With respect to the uncertainties and estimates relating to asset retirement obligations, refer to NOTE /one.fitted/eight.fitted PROVISIONS .\n\n## UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DEFERRED TAXES\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax legislation. The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets as well as the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities. In addition, management's assessments regarding the tax implications of the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic, including the accounting treatment of tax relief, were of particular significance.\n\nAuditor's response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of relevant local tax law, we examined the processes installed by management and obtained an understanding of internal controls for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions. In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether manage-\n\nment's assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from the acquisition or disposal of investments, corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities, carve-outs, especially in preparation of the spin-off of the Siemens Energy Business, findings of tax audits and cross-border matters, such as determining transfer prices. In order to assess measurement and completeness, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors and inspected expert legal or tax opinions and assessments commissioned by management. Further, we evaluated management's assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.\n\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management's assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income, particularly in view of the implications of the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic, and compared them to internal business plans. In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries' retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning.\n\nWe also examined the accounting effects resulting from the first-time application of IFRIC /two.fitted/three.fitted, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments .\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for income taxes, refer to NOTE /two.fitted MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Despite the impact of the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic, the Company not only demonstrated impressive operating strength, it also successfully completed a realignment of its structure and personnel. Siemens Energy was listed on the stock exchange as originally scheduled. This spin-off marks the implementation of a key element of the Vision /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted+ strategy concept. In fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Supervisory Board also successfully completed the succession process for the Managing Board of Siemens AG and established the new Managing Board team headed by Dr. Roland Busch. These steps provided an excellent foundation for the successful further development and growth of a focused Siemens AG.\n\nIn fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Supervisory Board performed in full the duties assigned to it by law, the Siemens Articles of Association and the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board. On the basis of detailed written and oral reports provided by the Managing Board, we monitored the Managing Board and advised it on the management of the Company. In addition, I regularly exchanged information with the President and CEO and the other Managing Board members. As a result, the Supervisory Board was always kept up to date on projected business policies, Company planning - including financial, investment and personnel planning - and the Company's profitability and business operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group. We were directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company and discussed these decisions with the Managing Board intensively and in detail. To the extent that Supervisory Board approval of the decisions and measures of Company management was required by law, the Siemens Articles of Association or our Bylaws, the members of the Supervisory Board - prepared in some cases by the Supervisory Board's committees - issued\n\nsuch approval after intensive review and discussion. The relevant Managing Board members informed us - within the limits set by the applicable legal framework - about measures and decisions of fundamental importance at the former Strategic Companies.\n\nA special focus of our activities in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted was the Company's further strategic development. At meetings and additional informational sessions in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, in particular, we concerned ourselves intensively with the spin-off of Siemens' energy business via a carve-out and subsequent public listing. We support the spin-off of the energy business and approved it at an extraordinary meeting on May /two.fitted/two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. In the second half of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, our activities focused on the further strategic development of Siemens AG after the spin-off. Together with the Managing Board, we discussed markets and trends, the goals and priorities of Siemens' businesses and the Company's technological and personnel strategy. Succession planning for the Managing Board was another focal point of our work in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. To open a new chapter in Siemens' history, we successfully completed the succession process and established the management team that will lead the focused Siemens AG as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\n## Topics at the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board\n\nWe held a total of six regular plenary meetings and five extraordinary meetings in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Topics of discussion at our regular plenary meetings were revenue, profit and employment development at Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as well as the Company's financial position and the results of its operations. In addition, we concerned ourselves, as occasion required, with acquisition and divestment projects and with risks to the Company. Portfolio measures were further topics of discussion. We also met at regular intervals without the Managing Board in attendance. On these occasions, we dealt with agenda items that concerned either the Managing Board itself or internal Supervisory Board matters.",

At an extraordinary meeting on January /one.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Audit Committee discussed financial, accounting and other key spin-off-related topics. An informational session was held for the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board on April /two.fitted/four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. Another such session was held for the shareholder representatives on April /two.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. At these informational sessions, at an extraordinary Audit Committee meeting on April /two.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, and at our meeting  on  May /eight.fitted,  /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the  Managing  Board  and Siemens Energy's designated leadership team - supported by external consultants and experts - provided us with detailed information regarding the planned spin-off in preparation for our decisions scheduled for May /two.fitted/two.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. At our meeting on May /eight.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, we approved - on the recommendation of the  Audit Committee - the closing statements of financial position of Siemens AG as of March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, which also serve as the closing statements of financial position pursuant to Section /one.fitted/two.fitted/five.fitted, sent. /one.fitted and Section /one.fitted/seven.fitted, para. /two.fitted of the German Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ).

On the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we approved, in addition, the adjustments to the stock-based compensation programs for active and former Managing Board members that had to be made in the course of the spin-off of Siemens' energy business. At this meeting, we also concerned ourselves with the agenda for the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting on July /nine.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, and approved the Managing Board's decisions regarding the conduct of this meeting as a virtual shareholders' meeting without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies in accordance with Section /one.fitted, para. /two.fitted of the German Act Concerning Measures Under the Law of Companies, Cooperative Societies, Associations, Foundations and Commonhold Property to Combat the Effects of the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted Pandemic ( Gesetz \u00fcber Ma\u00dfnahmen im Gesellschafts-, Genossenschafts-, Vereins-, Stiftungs- und Wohnungs-\n\ngentumsrecht zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Auswirkungen der COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted-Pandemie ) of March /two.fitted/seven.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted (Federal Law Gazette I No. /one.fitted/four.fitted /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, p. /five.fitted/seven.fitted/zero.fitted).\n\nAt our meeting on November /six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, we discussed the key financial figures for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted and approved the budget for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. We dealt with the carve-out and the preparations for the spin-off of Siemens' energy business. On a recommendation by the Compensation Committee, we also defined the Managing Board members' compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted on the basis of calculated target achievement. An internal review confirmed the appropriateness of this compensation. Against the backdrop of the changing regulatory framework and the new Group structure due to the Vision /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted+ strategy concept, we had already approved an adjustment to the Managing Board compensation system as of fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted at our meeting on September /one.fitted/eight.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. At that meeting, we had also defined the performance criteria for the Managing Board's variable compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. On this basis and on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we made a decision on target setting for Managing Board compensation for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, at our meeting on November /six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted. At this meeting, we also approved a Managing Board decision on financing measures.\n\nOn December /four.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, we discussed the financial statements  and  the  Combined  Management  Report  for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, the Annual Report for /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted - including the Report of the Supervisory Board, the Corporate Governance Report and the Compensation Report - and the agenda for the ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting on February /five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.

On the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we approved the Managing Board compensation system - including planned maximum compensation - effective October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/nine.fitted, as described in the 'Notice of Annual Shareholders' Meeting.' On the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we also made a further decision regarding the target setting and the maximum compensation for Managing Board compensation in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group were prepared in accordance with the International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German law set out in Section /three.fitted/one.fitted/five.fitted e (/one.fitted) of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch ). The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group also comply with the IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The independent auditors conducted their audit in accordance with Section /three.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted of the German Commercial Code and the EU Audit Regulation and German  generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements as promulgated by the Institut der Wirt schaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) as well as in supplementary com pliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). The abovementioned documents as well as the Managing Board's proposal for the appropriation of net income were submitted to us by the Managing Board in advance. The Audit Committee discussed the dividend proposal in detail at its meeting on November /one.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. It discussed the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Combined Management  Report in detail at its meeting on November /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted. In this context, the Audit Committee concerned itself, in particular, with the key audit matters described in the independent auditors' respective opinions, including the audit procedures implemented. The Audit Committee's review also covered the non-financial information for Siemens AG and the Siemens Group that is included in the Combined Management Report. The audit reports prepared by the independent auditors were distributed to all members of the Supervisory Board and comprehensively reviewed at the Supervisory Board meeting on  December /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, in the presence of the independent auditors, who reported on the scope, focal points and main findings of their audit, addressing, in particular, key audit matters and the audit procedures implemented. No major weaknesses in the Company's internal control or risk management systems were reported. At this meeting, the Managing Board explained the financial statements of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group as well as the Company's risk management system.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concurs with the results of the audit. Following the definitive findings of the Audit\n\nCommittee's examination and our own examination, we have no objections. The Managing Board prepared the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group. We  approved  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  and the Consolidated Financial Statements. In view of our approval,  the  financial  statements  are  accepted  as submitted. We endorsed the Managing Board's proposal that the net income available for distribution be used to pay out a dividend of \u20ac /three.fitted./five.fitted/zero.fitted per share entitled to a dividend and that the amount of net income attributable to shares of stock not entitled to receive a dividend for fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted be carried forward.\n\n## Changes in the composition of the Supervisory and Managing Boards\n\nThe following members left the Managing Board in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted: Janina Kugel (effective January /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted), Lisa Davis (effective February /two.fitted/nine.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted) and Michael Sen (effective March /three.fitted/one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted). The Supervisory Board appointed  Judith Wiese and Matthias Rebellius full members of the Managing Board, effective October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nRobert Kensbock left the Supervisory Board on September /two.fitted/five.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the effective date of the spin-off of Siemens' energy business. In a decision of October /one.fitted/six.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Charlottenburg District Court appointed Tobias B\u00e4umler to succeed Robert Kensbock as an employee repre sentative on the Supervisory Board for the remainder of Robert Kensbock's term of office.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Managing Board and all the employees and employee representatives of Siemens AG and all Group companies for their outstanding commitment and constructive cooperation in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted.\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, it has a two-tier board structure, consisting of a Managing Board and a Supervisory Board.\n\n## C./four.fitted./one.fitted./one.fitted Managing Board\n\nAs the top management body, the Managing Board is committed to serving the interests of the Company and achieving sustainable growth in company value. The members of the Managing Board are jointly responsible for the entire management of the Company and decide on basic issues of business policy and corporate strategy as well as on the Company's annual and multi-year plans.\n\nThe Managing Board prepares the Company's Quarterly Statements and Half-year Financial Report, the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group and the Combined  Management  Report  of  Siemens AG  and  the Siemens Group. In addition, the Managing Board ensures that the Company adheres to statutory requirements, official regulations and internal Company policies and works to achieve compliance with these provisions and policies within the Siemens Group. The Managing Board has established a comprehensive compliance management system. Protection is offered to employees and third parties who provide information on unlawful behavior within the Company. Details on the compliance management system are available on the Siemens Global Website\n\nat: WWW.SIEMENS.COM/SUSTAINABILITYINFORMATION\n\nThe Supervisory Board has issued Bylaws for the Managing Board that contain the assignment of different portfolios and the rules for cooperation both within the Managing Board and between the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board. In accordance with these Bylaws, the Managing Board is divided into the portfolio of the President and CEO and a variety of Managing Board portfolios.\n\nThe Managing Board members responsible for the individual Managing Board portfolios are defined in a business assignment plan that is approved by the Supervisory Board. As the Managing Board member with responsibility for the Human Resources portfolio, the Labor Director ( Arbeitsdirektor ) is appointed in accordance with the requirements of Section /three.fitted/three.fitted of the German Codetermination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz ). While the first-time appointment of Managing Board members shall not, as a rule, exceed a period of three years, an assessment is to be made in each individual case in order to determine what period of appointment is deemed appropriate within the legally permissible period. This matter is explained in greater detail in chapter C./four.fitted./two.fitted./one.fitted DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY WITH THE GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE .\n\nAs a rule, a portfolio assigned to an individual member is that member's own responsibility. Activities and transactions in a particular Managing Board portfolio that are considered to be extraordinarily important for the Company or associated with an extraordinary economic risk require the prior consent of the full Managing Board. The same applies to activities and transactions for which the President and CEO or another member of the Managing Board demands a prior decision by the Managing Board. The President and CEO is responsible for the coordination of all Managing Board portfolios. Further details are available in the Bylaws for the Managing Board at: WWW. SIEMENS.COM/BYLAWS-MANAGINGBOARD\n\nThe Managing Board and the Supervisory Board cooperate closely for the benefit of the Company. The Managing Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly, comprehensively and without delay on all issues of importance to the entire Company with regard to strategy, planning, business development, financial position, results of operations, compliance and entrepreneurial risks. At regular intervals, the Managing Board also discusses the status of strategy implementation with the Supervisory Board.",

They are committed to serving the interest of the Company. When making their decisions, they may not be guided by personal interests nor may they exploit for their own advantage business opportunities offered to the Company. Managing Board members may engage in secondary activities - in particular, supervisory board positions outside the Siemens Group - only with the approval of the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for decisions regarding any adjustments to Managing Board compensation that are necessary in order to take account of possible compensation for secondary activities. Every Managing Board member is under an obligation to disclose conflicts of interest without delay to the Chairman or Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board and to inform the other members of the Managing Board thereof.\n\n## EQUITY AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE MANAGING BOARD\n\nThe Managing Board has one committee, the Equity and Compensation Committee. This committee is responsible for the duties assigned to it by a decision of the Managing Board - including, in particular, duties in connection with\n\ncapital measures and equity-linked financial instruments relating to the compensation of all employees and managers of the Siemens Group except the members of the Managing Board and of Top Management and relating to share-based compensation components and employee share plans. The Equity and Compensation Committee comprises the President and CEO, the Managing Board member with responsibility for the Human Resources portfolio, the Managing Board member with responsibility for the Controlling and Finance portfolio and - as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted - the Deputy CEO. As of September /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, its members are Joe Kaeser (Chairman), Dr. Roland Busch and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas.

This assessment is to consider the individual qualifications and experience of the Managing Board member to be appointed and, in particular, the qualifications and experience that he or she has acquired over many years in management positions within the Siemens Group. With regard to the number of mandates accepted by Managing Board and Supervisory Board members, an assessment is to be possible in each individual case in order to determine if the number of accepted mandates relevant within the meaning of the Code is deemed appropriate.

The convening of a shareholders' meeting - even taking into account the shortened time limits stipulated in the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover  Act  ( Wertpapiererwerbs-  und  \u00dcbernahmegesetz ) - is an organizational challenge for large publicly listed companies. It appears doubtful whether the associated effort is justified in cases where no relevant decisions by the shareholders' meeting are intended. Therefore,  extraordinary  shareholders'  meetings  shall  be convened only in appropriate cases.\n\nAccording to the suggestion in D./eight.fitted sent. /two.fitted, participation by telephone or video conference in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees should not be the rule. At Siemens AG, participation in meetings is, as a rule, in person. Participation by telephone takes place only in exceptional cases. Due to the special circumstances created by the COVID-/one.fitted/nine.fitted pandemic, several meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees in fiscal /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted took place as virtual meetings or with the possibility of participation in a virtual format.\n\nFurther corporate governance practices applied beyond legal requirements are contained in our Business Conduct Guidelines.\n\n## THE COMPANY'S VALUES AND BUSINESS CONDUCT GUIDELINES\n\nIn the /one.fitted/seven.fitted/three.fitted years of its existence, our Company has built an excellent reputation around the world. Technical performance, innovation, quality, reliability, and international\n\nengagement have made Siemens a leading company in its areas of activity. It is top performance with the highest ethics that has made Siemens strong. This is what the Company will continue to stand for in the future.\n\nThe Business Conduct Guidelines provide the ethical and legal framework within which we want to conduct our activities and remain on course for success. They contain the basic principles and rules for our conduct within our Company and in relation to our external partners and the general public. They set out how we meet our ethical and legal responsibility as a Company and give expression to our Company values: 'Responsible' - 'Excellent' - ' Innovative.'\n\n## C./four.fitted./two.fitted./three.fitted Operation of the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, and composition and operation of their committees\n\nA general description of the composition and operation of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board and their committees,  including  the  Supervisory  Board's  selfassessment, can be found in chapter C./four.fitted./one.fitted MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL STRUCTURE . Further details can be derived from the bylaws for the governing bodies concerned.\n\n## C./four.fitted./two.fitted./four.fitted Targets for the quota of women on the Managing Board and at the two management levels below the Managing Board; Information on Supervisory Board compliance with minimum gender quota requirements\n\nAt Siemens AG, the target for the proportion of women on the Managing Board has been set at a minimum of /two.fitted/five.fitted % until June /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted.\n\nWhen filling managerial positions at the Company, the Managing Board takes diversity into account and, in particular, aims for an appropriate consideration of women and internationality. In /two.fitted/zero.fitted/one.fitted/seven.fitted, the Managing Board set the target for the percentage of women at each of the two management levels below the Managing Board at /two.fitted/zero.fitted %, applicable in each case until June /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board fulfilled the legal requirements regarding the minimum gender quota in the reporting period.",

Diversity with respect to such characteristics as age and gender as well as professional and educational background is an important selection criterion for appointments to Managing Board positions. When selecting members of the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board also gives special consideration to the following factors:\n\n- In addition to the expertise and the management and leadership experience required for their specific tasks, the Managing Board members shall have the broadest possible range of knowledge and experience and the widest possible educational and professional backgrounds.\n- Taking the Company's international orientation into account, the composition of the Managing Board shall reflect internationality with respect to different cultural backgrounds and international experience (such as extensive professional experience in foreign countries and responsibility for business activities in foreign countries in areas that are relevant for Siemens).\n\n- As a group, the Managing Board shall have experience in the business areas that are important for Siemens - in particular, in the industry, energy, healthcare and infrastructure sectors.\n- As a group, the Managing Board shall have many years of experience in technology (including information technology and digitalization), research and development, procurement, manufacturing and sales, finance, law (including compliance) and human resources.\n- When selecting individuals for Managing Board positions, the targets set by the Supervisory Board for the proportion of women on the Managing Board shall be taken into account. The Supervisory Board has established as a target that - until June /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted /two.fitted/five.fitted % of the Managing Board positions are to be held by women.\n- It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Code, the Supervisory Board has defined an age limit for the members of the Managing Board. In keeping with this limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as a rule, to be not older than /six.fitted/three.fitted years of age.\n\nWhen making an appointment to a specific Managing Board position, the decisive factor is always the Company's best interest, taking into consideration all circumstances in the individual case.'\n\n## STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIVERSITY CONCEPT FOR THE MANAGING BOARD\n\nThe diversity concept for the Managing Board is implemented as part of the process for making appointments to the Managing Board. When selecting candidates and /or making proposals for the appointment of Managing Board members, the Supervisory Board and the Chairman's Committee of the Supervisory Board take into account the requirements defined in the diversity concept for the Managing Board.\n\nThe Managing Board members have a broad range of knowledge, experience and educational and professional backgrounds as well as international experience. The Managing Board has all the knowledge and experience that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activities.",

In the summer of /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Supervisory Board appointed Judith Wiese and Matthias Rebellius to the Managing Board as of October /one.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, taking into account the diversity concept and the Company's best interest. The target for June /three.fitted/zero.fitted, /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/two.fitted, has been retained. The appropriate consideration of women is a key component of long-term succession planning for the Managing Board. Different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. No Managing Board member is currently older than /six.fitted/three.fitted years of age.\n\n## LONG-TERM SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR THE MANAGING BOARD\n\nJointly with the Managing Board and with the support of the Chairman's Committee, the Supervisory Board conducts long-term succession planning for the Managing Board. In its long-term succession planning, the Supervisory Board considers the target it has defined for the proportion of women on the Managing Board and the criteria set out in the diversity concept it has approved for the Managing Board's composition as well as the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ), the Code and the Bylaws for the Chairman's Committee. Considering the concrete qualification requirements and the above-mentioned criteria, the Chairman's Committee prepares an ideal profile, on the basis of which it compiles a shortlist of the available candidates. Structured interviews are then conducted with these candidates. After the interviews, a proposal is submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval. When developing the profile of requirements and selecting candidates, the Supervisory Board and the Chairman's Committee  are  supported,  if  necessary,  by  external consultants.\n\n## C./four.fitted./two.fitted./six.fitted Objectives regarding the Supervisory Board's composition as well as the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervisory Board\n\nIn September /two.fitted/zero.fitted/two.fitted/zero.fitted, the Supervisory Board approved changes to the objectives for its composition including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept:\n\n' The  composition  of  the  Supervisory  Board  of Siemens AG shall be such that the Supervisory Board's ability to effectively monitor and advise the Managing Board is ensured. In this connection, mutually complementary collaboration among members with a wide range of personal and professional backgrounds and diversity with regard to internationality, age and gender are considered helpful.\n\n## PROFILE OF REQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERTISE\n\nThe candidates proposed for election to the Supervisory Board shall have the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to carry out the functions of a Supervisory Board member in a multinational company oriented toward the capital markets and to safeguard the reputation of Siemens in public. In particular, care shall be taken in regard to the personality, integrity, commitment and professionalism of the individuals proposed for election.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that, in the Supervisory Board, as a group, all knowhow and experience is available that is considered essential in view of Siemens' activities. This includes, for instance, knowledge and experience in the areas of technology (including information technology and digitalization), procurement, manufacturing and sales, finance, law (including compliance) and human resources. In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board shall collectively have knowledge and experience in the business areas that are important for Siemens, in particular, in the areas of industry, energy, healthcare and infrastructure. As a group, the members of the Supervisory Board are to be familiar with the sector in which the Company operates.",

The goal is to make sure that the present considerable share of Supervisory Board members with extensive international experience is maintained.\n\n## DIVERSITY\n\nWith regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board, attention shall be paid to achieving sufficient diversity. Not only is appropriate consideration to be given to women. Diversity of cultural heritage and a wide range of different educational and professional backgrounds, experiences and ways of thinking are also to be promoted.
