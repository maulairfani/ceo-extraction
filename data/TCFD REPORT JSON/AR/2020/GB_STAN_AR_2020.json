The world is a very different place from this time last year and we all must continue to adjust and adapt. We have very sadly lost colleagues and some of you will have also lost friends and loved ones, so I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to everyone who has suffered during the pandemic.\n\nThroughout this tumultuous period, our 89,000 colleagues around the world - led by our Chief Executive Bill Winters and colleagues in the Management Team - have focused on protecting the interests of shareholders, while ensuring the wellbeing of colleagues, supporting our customers and clients, and showing solidar/i.rightty with our communit/i.rightes. All of this while preserving our operational and financ/i.rightal resil/i.rightence.\n\nThey have done this demonstrating exemplary character and with great humanity, something that I have always said is a dist/i.rightnctive characterist/i.rightc of this Group.\n\nRepayment holidays, fee waivers and loan extensions were offered to ind/i.rightvidual and small business customers, and we made $1 bill/i.righton of financ/i.rightng available at cost to those provid/i.rightng crit/i.rightcal goods and services in the fight against the virus. We also established a $50 mill/i.righton Global Charitable Fund to help those affected with/i.rightn our communit/i.rightes. So far, we have donated $28 mill/i.righton across 59 markets, with a comparable sum contributed by colleagues and the Group to support and stimulate economic recovery.\n\n## A resil/i.rightent financ/i.rightal performance, enabling a return to capital distr/i.rightbutions\n\nBill and Andy Halford, our Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer, will explain in more detail later in this report how our financ/i.rightal performance was impacted in some respects by the effects of the pandemic. But those results also show evidence of great resil/i.rightence - certainly far greater resil/i.rightence than I suspect would have been the case if the pandemic had occurred a few years ago.\n\nOur profit reduced despite lower costs due to a combinat/i.righton of lower interest rates that affected income and higher impa/i.rightrments driven in part by the reserves that we built to absorb possible future credit losses as the pandemic unfolds. But we remained highly liqu/i.rightd and our capital posit/i.righton actually strengthened further, which means that with better vis/i.rightbil/i.rightt y over the near-term economic outlook the Board is recommending the payment of a full-year ordinary div/i.rightdend of $284 mill/i.righton or 9 cents per share.\n\nAnd with our common equity tier 1 capital ratio above the top end of our 13-14 per cent target range, even after accruing for the recommended ordinary div/i.rightdend, we have decided to complete the share buy-back programme that was suspended in April 2020, meaning we will shortly start purchasing and then cancelling up to $254 mill/i.righton worth of ordinary shares.\n\nThe proposed full-year div/i.rightdend and share buy-back programme together is the maximum we are authorised by our regulator to return to shareholders at this stage, being 0.2/uni00A0per cent of our risk-weighted assets as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Board's posit/i.righton on capital returns remains essentially the same as it was before our regulator requested us to withdraw the recommended 2019 final div/i.rightdend. Having now resumed it, we expect to be able to increase the full-year div/i.rightdend per share over time as we execute our strategy and progress towards a 10 per cent return on tangible equity. To the extent addit/i.rightonal capital generated over that period is not needed to fund further business growth, we will continue to find optimal ways of returning the excess to our owners.",

She brings considerable experience as a chief executive, sign/i.rightficant understanding of the global financ/i.rightal services industry, an in-depth understanding of the regulatory landscape, as well as experience of operating across many of our markets, especially in the Africa region.\n\nWe welcome the appointment of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the new Director-General of the World Trade Organisat/i.righton, as a result of which she will shortly step down from the Board. I would like to thank Dr Ngozi for her valuable contribut/i.rightons to the Group over the last three years.\n\nWe recently announced several changes to our Board Committee composit/i.righton, details of which can be found in the Directors' report on page 80. We also recently announced that Robert Zoellick is taking over as chair of our International Advisory Council, a diverse, multid/i.rightscipl/i.rightnary panel of experts whose role is to provide ins/i.rightght on global trends and opportunit/i.rightes that may affect the Group and our clients. Robert served as president of the World Bank from 2007 to 2012, where he led the effort to assist developing economies during the Global Financ/i.rightal Cris/i.rights and held various posts in the US Government over three admin/i.rightstrations.\n\n## What it means to us to be purpose-led\n\nStandard Chartered has a history of being bold and find/i.rightng new opportunit/i.rightes in times of change. For over 160 years we have been pioneers of internat/i.rightonal trade and investment, facil/i.righttating the flow of capital to where it is needed most to drive commerce and prosperity.\n\nAnd yet, in today's complex, fast-moving and unstable world, it is clear that markets, trade and capital flows are fail/i.rightng to address some of the key socio-economic and environmental challenges of our time. It doesn't need to be this way; we believe commerce and prosperity can be driven without people being left behind, without the planet being negatively impacted, and without creating div/i.rightsions that dim/i.rightnish our sense of community. Never has finance and commerce been more important in fuelling posit/i.rightve change where it matters most - and especially in the world's emerging economic powerhouses.\n\nThis is why now, more than ever before, we must lead with our purpose. This is the moment to use our unique capacity to work across boundaries, connecting capital, people, ideas and best practices, both locally and globally. Our convict/i.righton is that we can accelerate our strategy and its wider impact by connecting it to the big issues facing our world. We will take a stand on those issues, reshape our Group where necessary to meet them and grow by playing an active role.\n\nThe refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties that Bill describes separately are fully aligned with this object/i.rightve. This is not just about social responsib/i.rightlity. This is fundamentally about doing great business, transforming our franchise and taking our promise of being Here for good to a whole new level. We're determined to unleash a new dynamic in the Group - powered by our purpose. We are build/i.rightng on who we are and what we are good at, and that is why I am confident we can step forward and make a real difference.\n\n## Outlook\n\nSo, what does 2021 hold? I hope and expect it will be a better year overall for the world and for us, even if uncertaint/i.rightes continue on several fronts. First, despite the recent posit/i.rightve news on vaccines, we will be coping with the health and economic impact of COVID-19 for some time. Yet I envisage",

I expect that this will ultimately result in advances in productiv/i.rightty growth.\n\nThere remain plenty of reasons to be confident in this evolving environment. We have shown that we are getting much better at converting the undoubted dynamism of our home markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East into profitable growth. We grew income between four and eight per cent on a like-for-like basis every quarter between the end of 2018 and the end of the first half of 2020 when the impact of COVID-19 hit, and this was while generating posit/i.rightve income-to-cost jaws in every period. I have always been very clear that strong growth is no good if it isn't safe and sustainable, which is why I am pleased to see the risk framework that the Management Team worked so hard to implement from 2015 perform so well last year.\n\nThe Board will continue to oversee the execution of the Group's strategy. Our goal is to provide a best-in-class experience for our clients, be that through our unique network, personalised affluent banking or attractive dig/i.righttal offerings in mass retail, includ/i.rightng through key strategic partnerships. And to do this with a world-class workforce and an agile and innovat/i.rightve organisat/i.righton which makes us simpler, faster and better. In doing so, we also aspire to become a leader in the sustainab/i.rightlity space. As a Group with a large and long-standing emerging markets footprint, we feel we have the responsib/i.rightlity and a great opportunity to channel financ/i.rightng to where it is most needed to make the planet more sustainable.\n\nI said in last year's report that instab/i.rightlity and rapid change are becoming the new normal, and that adaptation is a skill I saw as being core to the Group's DNA. I am humbled by some of the stories I have heard of how my colleagues are ensuring exceptional continu/i.rightty of service to our clients in often diff/i.rightcult circumstances, and I have no doubt that they will continue to go the extra mile to make a posit/i.rightve difference.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman 25 February 2021\n\n## Working from home\n\nWith the pandemic forcing many of our markets into lockdown, we had to move quickly to ensure we could operate effectively when many of our colleagues had no option but to work from home.\n\n'The excellent work of our technology team, which with/i.rightn a matter of weeks sourced thousands of laptops and increased the capacity of our Virtual Private Network by 600 per cent, streamlined the process of switch/i.rightng to home working and supported our operational resil/i.rightence, enabling our employees to deliver continu/i.rightty of service to our customers.'

We remain strong and profitable, although clearly impacted by credit challenges and low interest rates. Our strategic transformation continues to progress well, and our outlook is bright.\n\nOur relative strength derives from actions we have taken over the past five years, the first phase of which was to secure our foundations. Our efforts during that time were not always obvious externally, but the benefits became clear last year when we came through an extraordinary real-life stress test with financ/i.rightal and operational resil/i.rightence. We were open for business for our customers and communit/i.rightes throughout the cris/i.rights and, as Andy will describe later in this report, we remained profitable while preserving very strong liqu/i.rightdity and capital posit/i.rightons.\n\nSince 2018, we have been executing the second phase, build/i.rightng on those stronger foundations. We have delivered our different/i.rightated network and affluent businesses, optim/i.rightsed returns in India, Korea, the UAE and Indonesia - profits in those markets in aggregate rose 34 per cent - and invested heavily in what we expect to be transformational dig/i.righttal in/i.righttiat/i.rightves that are now live and winn/i.rightng business across our footprint.\n\nWe are ready now to start the next phase.\n\n## Our refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties\n\nJos\u00e9 has already described what it means for us to be a purpose-led organisat/i.righton, and how that will guide us in the years ahead. The refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties which we share today link directly to our purpose to drive commerce and prosperity with our unique divers/i.rightty and we have geared up to develop the skills, mindset and capabil/i.rightties to deliver both. They will take us beyond what we currently do, how we currently think and extend our exist/i.rightng scale and impact.\n\n- \u00b7 Network: we will continue to unlock the power of our unique physical footprint by dig/i.righttally deliver/i.rightng to our clients best-in-class emerging and developed markets capabil/i.rightties, ins/i.rightghts and solutions\n- \u00b7 Affluent: we will reinforce our strong credentials in the affluent segment by build/i.rightng loyalty and trust through offering our clients personalised wealth advice based on superior ins/i.rightght\n- \u00b7 Mass retail: we now have a range of proven dig/i.righttal capabil/i.rightties and our remodelled risk framework has been thoroughly stress-tested, which means we can substantially and economically scale up our mass market retail presence. We will do this with enhanced data analytics and a superior end-to-end dig/i.righttal experience, developing opportunit/i.rightes on our own and with partners\n- \u00b7 Sustainab/i.rightlity: we will lead with a different/i.rightated sustainab/i.rightlity offering, includ/i.rightng reflecting net-zero climate goals in everything we do.

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review continued\n\nThese strategic prior/i.rightties will be supported by three crit/i.rightcal enablers. We are invest/i.rightng heavily in our people, giv/i.rightng colleagues the skills they need to succeed, bring/i.rightng in expertise in crit/i.rightcal areas and evolving to a more innovat/i.rightve and agile operating model. We are fundamentally changing the way we work, accelerating our time-to-market and increas/i.rightng productiv/i.rightty with cross-functional teams driv/i.rightng agreed client and productiv/i.rightty outcomes. And we are driv/i.rightng innovat/i.righton to improve our clients' experience, increase our operational effic/i.rightency and tap new sources of income, creating opportunit/i.rightes that I can foresee over time representing the major/i.rightty of our income.\n\n## Re-committ/i.rightng to deliver/i.rightng return on tangible equity above 10 per cent\n\nOur strategic progress continues apace despite the challenges related to COVID-19. Our returns have suffered though as the resulting severe economic dislocat/i.rightons and low interest rates impacted our financ/i.rightal performance. The progress we made up to the onset of the pandemic, however, in every key financ/i.rightal and strategic metric, gives us confidence that we can return to that trajectory as economies recover over the coming year.\n\nOur refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties, together with the financ/i.rightal framework that is laid out in the presentation that accompanies this report, should allow us to improve our return on tangible equity from the 3 per cent we delivered in 2020 to more than 7 per cent by 2023 as we progressively advance to our target of more than 10 per cent. We will hit those targets sooner if interest rates start to normalise earlier than antic/i.rightpated, but in any event we expect to generate sign/i.rightficant surplus capital over this period that will be returned to shareholders if not deployed to fund addit/i.rightonal growth. We are starting as we mean to go on, by completing the share buy-back programme that was suspended in April 2020.\n\n## Resil/i.rightence at our core\n\nIt has been an extraordinary year in many respects. But we have a long history of resil/i.rightence to economic shocks and geopolit/i.rightcal tussles, and the opportunit/i.rightes and even the challenges have not fundamentally changed.\n\n- \u00b7 The negative impacts of COVID-19 should be largely transitory, and indeed have provided powerful lessons that will help us to accelerate our pursuit of better productiv/i.rightty and may even lead to a better world. The almost overnight shift to more flexible working should benefit us over time both financ/i.rightally and in terms of fostering greater divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton, and also caused us to add to our extraordinary focus on keeping pace with escalating cyber, fraud and other threats. And while we will likely live with very low interest rates for several years, even that won't last forever as economies start to reflate\n- \u00b7 As an internat/i.rightonal bank with a unique emerging market footprint straddling the East and the West, we have always had to deal with polit/i.rightcal turbulence, both with/i.rightn and between our markets. This was unusually vis/i.rightble in 2020 but we are hopeful that a spir/i.rightt of engagement will help avoid further escalation. We will comply with all laws that affect us and our clients and hope for a more diplomat/i.rightc and multilateral solution to the world's challenges\n- \u00b7 Global trade was slowing before COVID-19 and slumped when it hit, as markets around the world went into various forms of lockdown. The pace of growth comes and goes but we don't believe global trade has permanently gone into reverse. And while some trade corridors such as those between the US and China may decline from the very high levels of recent years, they will be replaced by others, in particular with/i.rightn the Asia and Africa regions, which play perfectly to our strengths\n\nOne thing remains clear: we can win through a relentless focus on improv/i.rightng the experience of our customers while working hard to attract new ones, and while keeping a tight grip on costs. The underlying macroeconomic and demographic growth drivers in our footprint remain strong and we remain well posit/i.rightoned to benefit from them. With our virtual bank Mox launched in Hong Kong, our banking-as-aservice venture 'nexus' preparing to launch with partners in Indonesia and dig/i.righttal banking now firmly embedded across our Africa franchise, we are better able to capture and create opportunit/i.rightes in markets that are likely to remain the most dynamic in the world for the foreseeable future.",

Developing an outsized domestic market, industr/i.rightal upgrading and achiev/i.rightng self-reliance in technology are high on the agenda, with the aim of ensuring supply-chain security in a less friendly global backdrop\n- \u00b7 We expect the change of admin/i.rightstration in the US to bring a more predictable approach to interact/i.rightons between the US and China. It is, however, clear there will continue to be a focus on key areas such as trade, technology and human rights\n- \u00b7 We expect China's steady growth and the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) commitment to low interest rates to continue to support Hong Kong's recovery in the coming quarters. However, we see linger/i.rightng headwinds from widespread travel bans, weak external demand excluding China, and further upside risk to the local unemployment rate, lim/i.rightting recovery headroom. We forecast a moderate rebound of GDP growth to 3.5 per cent in 2021, following a contraction of 6.1 per cent in 2020\n- \u00b7 We expect South Korea's economy to grow 2.9 per cent in 2021, following a recession of -1 per cent in 2020. Given Korea's reliance on external demand, growth hinges on the timely deployment of the vaccine nationw/i.rightde and globally. We expect the Bank of Korea to continue buying KTB to ease the long-term interest rate to avoid a crowding-out effect from a structurally large budget defic/i.rightt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ASEAN & South Asia\n\nASEAN is expected to rebound in 2021 after a pandemic-induced recession in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Base effects aside, very supportive fiscal and monetary measures should help ASEAN recover. But until vaccines are successfully rolled out, social distanc/i.rightng measures may lim/i.rightt the strength of any rebound\n- \u00b7 The recovery may be uneven, with hospital/i.rightty-related sectors likely to face greater challenges. Countries with large tourism and air-transport related sectors such as Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia may see continued challenges but activ/i.rightty should pick up as restrict/i.rightons on movement ease either due to a vaccine or uniform operating standards to try to reopen borders\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure spending in countries such as Indonesia and Phil/i.rightppines should also return after a year where governments had to focus on COVID-19\n- \u00b7 The likely global recovery and a more conducive global trade environment under a new admin/i.rightstration in the US may also support the export-oriented region, especially Vietnam and Singapore\n- \u00b7 India's economy may rebound by 10 per cent in FY22 (year ending March 2022), after one of the worst recessions in four decades; FY21 GDP likely contracted by 8 per cent. We see upside risks to our GDP forecasts as the government has rolled out fiscal stimulus until FY26. Monetary policy is likely to remain supportive in FY22, though upside risk to growth and the possib/i.rightlity of higher inflat/i.righton could lead to gradual normalisat/i.righton in H2-FY22. Strong external buffers, better growth prospects and continued focus on reforms are likely to ring-fence rating downgrade risks\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our focus over recent years on divers/i.rightfying our sources of income was not quite suffic/i.rightent to offset the effect of the sign/i.rightficant reductions in global interest rates that occurred mid-year and hence overall income declined slightly as did our pre-provis/i.righton operating profit, notwithstand/i.rightng tight control of expenses. The actions taken in recent years to improve the quality of our balance sheet sheltered us from some of the worst effects of COVID-19 but we nonetheless incurred credit impa/i.rightrment charges more than double that of the prior year, albeit the major/i.rightty were booked in the first half of the year with a noticeably lower level of charges in the second half. Overall this resulted in underlying operating profit decreasing by 40 per cent but we ended the year with our key capital ratio, CET1, at 14.4 per cent includ/i.rightng the benefit of selling our stake in Permata earlier in the year. This is not only above the top of our target range of 13 to 14 per cent but also the highest level it has been for many years. The Group also retained a highly liqu/i.rightd balance sheet and consequently we believe we enter 2021 well equipped to see through the remain/i.rightng challenges of COVID-19 and, importantly, well posit/i.rightoned to benefit from the subsequent upturn in the global economy.\n\nAll commentary that follows is on an underlying basis and comparisons are made to the equivalent period in 2019 on a reported currency basis, unless otherwise stated.\n\n- \u00b7 Operating income declined 3 per cent and was down 2 per cent on a constant currency basis\n- \u00b7 Net interest income decreased 11 per cent with increased volumes more than offset by a 19 per cent or 31 basis point reduction in net interest margin\n- \u00b7 Other income increased 4 per cent, or 3 per cent excluding the posit/i.rightve impact in DVA, with a particularly strong performance in Financ/i.rightal Markets\n- \u00b7 Operating expenses excluding the UK bank levy reduced 2/uni00A0per cent or 1 per cent on a constant currency basis, with the impact of COVID-19 resulting in lower bonus accruals reflecting underlying performance, includ/i.rightng lower profits, and reduced spend on travel and entertainment, partly offset by the continued focus on invest/i.rightng in new dig/i.righttal capabil/i.rightties. Operating expenses in 4Q'20 increased 6 per cent compared to 3Q'20 due to a $100 mill/i.righton increase in investment P&L charge as the Group started to posit/i.righton itself to capital/i.rightse on the expected economic recovery in its markets. The cost-to-income ratio (excluding the UK bank levy and DVA) increased 1/uni00A0percentage point to 67 per cent. The UK bank levy decreased by $16 mill/i.righton to $331 mill/i.righton; in 2021 it will be chargeable on only the Group's UK balance sheet with the current expectation being that it will reduce to around $100/uni00A0mill/i.righton at that time\n- \u00b7 Credit impa/i.rightrment increased by $1,388 mill/i.righton to $2,294/uni00A0mill/i.righton. This was mainly driven by a $823 mill/i.righton increase in Stage 3 impa/i.rightrments across all client segments to $1,467 mill/i.righton, around one-third of which related to three unconnected Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking client exposures that were reported in 1Q'20. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrments increased by $565 mill/i.righton to $827 mill/i.righton and included a net increase in the judgemental management overlay of $337 mill/i.righton as the Group proactively reserved for forward-looking risks. Total credit impa/i.rightrment of $2,294 mill/i.righton represents a loan-loss rate of 66 basis points",

The Group could only recognise its share of the profits of its associate China Bohai Bank for ten months due to the tim/i.rightng of its recently completed in/i.righttial public offering in July 2020. The Group's share of Bohai's annual preference share div/i.rightdend, $22 mill/i.righton, was deducted from its share of profit in 4Q'20. Addit/i.rightonally, the Group's share of China Bohai Bank reduced in 4Q'20 to 16.26 per cent from 19.99 per cent and this will be the share of profit that is reported in future quarters\n- \u00b7 Profit before tax decreased 40 per cent or 39 per cent on a constant currency basis. Statutory profit before tax decreased 57 per cent driven by charges totalling $895/uni00A0mill/i.righton relating to restructuring, goodwill impa/i.rightrment - includ/i.rightng $489 mill/i.righton princ/i.rightpally relating to India and United Arab Emirates - and other items\n- \u00b7 Taxation was $862 mill/i.righton on a statutory basis. Taxation on underlying profits was at an effective rate of 37.7 per cent, an increase of 8 percentage points reflecting the nonrepeat of prior year credits and the effect of lower profits concentrating the impact of non-deductible expenses partly offset by a one-off credit in 4Q'20 relating to an increase in the rate at which the US deferred tax asset is recognised. Taxation on statutory profits was at an effective rate of 53.4 per cent, an increase of 16 percentage points on the underlying rate due to elevated goodwill impa/i.rightrments\n- \u00b7 Return on tangible equity decreased by 340 basis points to 3.0 per cent, with the impact of reduced profits partly offset by lower tangible equity reflecting the share buy-back programmes completed since 1Q'19\n- \u00b7 Underlying basic earnings per share (EPS) reduced 52 per cent to 36.1 cents and statutory EPS declined 46.6 cents to 10.4 cents\n- \u00b7 A final ordinary div/i.rightdend per share of 9 cents has been proposed, which along with the announced share buy-back programme of $254 mill/i.righton is the maximum the Group is authorised by its regulator to return to shareholders currently, being 0.2 per cent of risk-weighted assets as at 31/uni00A0December 2020\n\n## Summary of financ/i.rightal performance\n\n|                                                                   | 2020

Trade declined 10 per cent reflecting a sign/i.rightficant reduction in global trade as a result of COVID-19. Cash Management declined 23/uni00A0per cent with double-dig/i.rightt volume growth being more than offset by declin/i.rightng margins given the low interest rate environment.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal Markets income grew 18 per cent, or 14 per cent excluding DVA, benefit/i.rightng from market volatil/i.rightty and increased hedging and investment activ/i.rightty by clients. There was strong double-dig/i.rightt growth in Rates, Foreign Exchange and Commodit/i.rightes. After a slow first quarter, Credit and Capital Markets recovered momentum and ended the year with income up 11 per cent. Income from Securit/i.rightes Services, which is now managed with/i.rightn Financ/i.rightal Markets having previously been reported as part of Transaction Banking, declined 7 per cent. The decline in Other Financ/i.rightal Markets included a $56 mill/i.righton charge related to a change in the valuation methodology of structured notes in 4Q'20.\n\nCorporate Finance income was down 2 per cent driven by lower income from aviat/i.righton clients as the sector was sign/i.rightficantly impacted by COVID-19, partly offset by drawdowns on revolving credit facil/i.rightties which were largely repaid or refinanced in 2H'20.\n\nLending and Portfolio Management income was up 8 per cent with improved margins in Corporate Lending.\n\nWealth Management income grew 5 per cent despite sign/i.rightficantly more challenging market condit/i.rightons. There was a particularly strong sales performance in FX, equit/i.rightes and structured notes driv/i.rightng income excluding bancassurance up 14 per cent. Bancassurance income was lower by 16 per cent resulting from reduced branch walk-ins due to COVID-19, partially offset by increased dig/i.righttal channel usage.\n\nRetail Products income declined 8 per cent or 7 per cent on a constant currency basis. Deposits income declined 27 per cent as margin compression more than offset increased volumes. Increases in volumes and margins led to double-dig/i.rightt income growth across Mortgages and Auto and Other Retail Products. Credit Cards and Personal Loans income was down 3 per cent as COVID-19 impacted new sales.\n\nTreasury income reduced 42 per cent as a fall in interest rates led to lower interest income on Treasury assets that was partially offset by a reduction in the expense of Treasury liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. An addit/i.rightonal $220 mill/i.righton in realisat/i.righton gains, primar/i.rightly booked in 1H'20, was broadly offset by lower FX switch income and negative movements in hedge ineffect/i.rightveness, primar/i.rightly recorded in 2H'20.\n\nOther products income improved by $186 mill/i.righton to negative $60 mill/i.righton reflecting interest credits and other one-off items in India, Korea and Singapore.",

Lower expenses were more than offset by higher credit impa/i.rightrments resulting in profits declin/i.rightng 18 per cent. Retail Banking income declined 3 per cent as income growth in Wealth Management was more than offset by the effects of the low interest rate environment which resulted in Deposits income declin/i.rightng 26 per cent. Expenses were 2 per cent lower but were more than offset by higher impa/i.rightrments, which resulted in profits declin/i.rightng 46 per cent. Commercial Banking profits more than halved, driven by impa/i.rightrments which more than doubled and 10 per cent lower income partly offset by 8 per cent lower expenses. A non-repeat of a prior-year impa/i.rightrment release meant Private Banking profit was down 34 per cent. Central & other items (segment) recorded a loss of $196 mill/i.righton driven by a 32 per cent decline in income, primar/i.rightly in Treasury, 4 per cent higher expenses from increased investment spend includ/i.rightng funding SC Ventures, and a reduction in the Group's share of China Bohai Bank's profits.\n\nGreater China & North Asia remained the largest regional contributor to the Group, generating 81 per cent of the overall Group's profit before tax. Profit declined 16 per cent driven by higher impa/i.rightrments while income declined only 2 per cent despite challenging market condit/i.rightons partly offset by a 1 per cent reduction in expenses. ASEAN & South Asia income growth of 4 per cent and 2 per cent lower expenses were more than offset by higher impa/i.rightrments, resulting in profits declin/i.rightng 24 per cent. Africa & Middle East income declined 8/uni00A0per cent, or 3 per cent on a constant currency basis with continued macroeconomic challenges also impact/i.rightng credit/uni00A0impa/i.rightrments, which resulted in profits declin/i.rightng to $13/uni00A0mill/i.righton for the year. Europe & Americas profit increased by/uni00A0146 per cent driven by 11 per cent higher income reflecting exceptionally strong Financ/i.rightal Markets performance and 6/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent lower expenses. The loss incurred by Central & other items (regions) increased by $579 mill/i.righton to $705 mill/i.righton loss due to lower returns paid to Treasury on the equity provided to the regions in a falling interest rate environment.\n\nAddit/i.rightonal informat/i.righton on client segment and geographic region performance is contained on pages 73-76\n\n## Adjusted net interest income and margin\n\n|                                                    | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019\u00b9 $mill/i.righton   | Change\u00b2 %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| Adjusted net interest income 3                     | 6,921                   | 8,007                   | (14)        |\n| Average interest-earning assets                    | 526,370                 | 494,756                 | 6           |\n| Average interest-bearing liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes | 478,051                 | 444,595                 | 8           |\n| Gross yield (%) 4                                  | 2.34                    | 3.34                    | (100)       |\n| Rate paid (%) 4                                    | 1.12                    | 1.92                    | (80)        |\n| Net yield (%) 4                                    | 1.22                    | 1.42                    | (20)        |\n| Net interest margin (%) 4,5                        | 1.31                    | 1.62                    | (31)        |\n\nAdjusted net income was down 14 per cent driven by a 19 per cent decline in net interest margin which fell 31 basis points, primar/i.rightly reflecting the interest rate cuts which occurred in late 2019 and to a much larger extent in early 2020.\n\nThis more than offset the impact of improvements in balance sheet mix and liab/i.rightlity repric/i.rightng in/i.righttiat/i.rightves.

Actions taken in previous years to secure the Group's foundations - includ/i.rightng increas/i.rightng divers/i.rightficat/i.righton of credit exposures and improv/i.rightng the risk culture - underpinned the Group's resil/i.rightence to these extraordinary challenges. Having made substantial provis/i.rightons against expected credit losses in the first half of the year, condit/i.rightons stabil/i.rightsed somewhat in the second half and the stock of high-risk assets reduced from its peak in August 2020. However, despite these encouraging signs the credit risks facing the Group are likely to remain elevated during what is likely to be a diff/i.rightcult and uneven economic recovery.\n\nFull year 2020 credit impa/i.rightrment increased by $1,388 mill/i.righton to $2,294 mill/i.righton but was $840 mill/i.righton lower in 2H'20 compared to 1H'20 while credit impa/i.rightrment in 4Q'20 was broadly flat compared to 4Q'19.\n\nStage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrments increased to $827 mill/i.righton due to deteriorat/i.rightng macroeconomic variables and stage downgrades on account of COVID-19 uncertaint/i.rightes. The $565/uni00A0mill/i.righton increase included an increase in the overlay of $337 mill/i.righton which was net of a $41 mill/i.righton release in 4Q'20. The overlay reflected management's judgement regarding:\n\n- \u00b7 Elements of the macroeconomic outlook not captured in the modelled outcome for Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking\n- \u00b7 The potential impact to delinquenc/i.rightes and flow rates in Retail Banking of extensions to payment relief schemes and ongoing lockdowns in some markets as well as the ending of these schemes in India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Indonesia\n\nby growth in customer accounts. The rate paid on liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes decreased by 80 basis points compared to the average in 2019 reflecting interest rate movements. This was partly offset by a shift of customer accounts from higher-paying time deposits to lower-rate and non-interest bearing current and savings accounts.",

        "page_content": "Stage 3 impa/i.rightrments increased by $823 mill/i.righton across all client segments to $1,467 mill/i.righton with broadly one-third relating to three unconnected fraud-related Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking client exposures that were reported in 1Q'20.\n\nTotal credit impa/i.rightrment of $2,294 mill/i.righton represents a loan-loss rate of 66 basis points (2019: 27 basis points) with the management overlay contribut/i.rightng 11 basis points.\n\nGross Stage 3 loans and advances to customers of $9.2 bill/i.righton were up 25 per cent compared to 31 December 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 volatil/i.rightty which led to macroeconomic deteriorat/i.righton in Retail Banking portfolios and Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking clients. These credit-impa/i.rightred loans represented 3.2 per cent of gross loans and advances, an increase of 50 basis points compared to 31 December 2019. The stage 3 cover ratio decreased to 58 per cent from 68 per cent in 2019 due to write-offs particularly in relation to Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking clients and new downgrades with low levels of coverage, which have benefited from credit\n\ninsurance and guarantees, includ/i.rightng from export credit agencies. The cover ratio post tangible collateral decreased to 76 per cent from 85 per cent in 2019 with some of the 2020 downgrades being covered by guarantees and insurance which are not included as tangible collateral.\n\nCredit grade 12 balances increased 35 per cent since 31 December 2019 primar/i.rightly from new inflows from Early Alert Non-Purely Precautionary (EANPP) accounts. These EANPP accounts more than doubled to $10.7 bill/i.righton in 2020 on the back of proactive portfolio and sector reviews, particularly for vulnerable sectors but have declined through 2H'20 since the peak in August 2020. The Group continues to monitor its exposures in the Aviat/i.righton, Hospital/i.rightty and Oil & Gas sectors particularly carefully, given the unusual stresses caused by the effects of COVID-19.\n\nThe proportion of investment grade corporate exposures has increased since 31 December 2019 by 1 percentage point to 62 per cent.\n\n## Restructuring, goodwill impa/i.rightrment and other items\n\n|                                                  | 2020                           | 2020                                         | 2020                         | 2019                           | 2019                                         | 2019                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                                  | Restructuring  $mill/i.righton | Goodwill  impa/i.rightrment  $mill/i.righton | Other items  $mill/i.righton | Restructuring  $mill/i.righton | Goodwill  impa/i.rightrment  $mill/i.righton | Other items  $mill/i.righton |\n| Operating income                                 | 27                             | -                                            | (38)                         | 146                            | -                                            | -                            |\n| Operating expenses                               | (252)                          | -                                            | 14                           | (298)                          | -                                            | (226)                        |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment                         | (31)                           | -                                            | -                            | (2)                            | -                                            | -                            |\n| Other impa/i.rightrment                          | (113)                          | (489)                                        | -                            | (98)                           | (27)                                         | -                            |\n| Profit from associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures | (13)                           | -                                            | -                            | (2)                            | -                                            | 48                           |\n| Loss before taxation                             | (382)                          | (489)                                        | (24)                         | (254)                          | (27)                                         | (178)                        |\n\nThe Group's statutory performance is adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent, other infrequent and/ or exceptional transactions that are sign/i.rightficant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period and items which management and investors would ordinar/i.rightly ident/i.rightfy separately when assessing underlying performance period-by-period.\n\nRestructuring charges of $382 mill/i.righton for 2020 are broadly split evenly between actions to exit the Group's discont/i.rightnued businesses, primar/i.rightly ship leasing and princ/i.rightpal finance, and actions to transform the organisat/i.righton to improve productiv/i.rightty, primar/i.rightly redundancy related charges, the major/i.rightty of which were booked in 4Q'20.

Profit accretion and other items includ/i.rightng the net impact of FX movement on reserves and RWAs contributed an increase in the CET1 ratio of approximately 40 basis points.\n\nThe impact on credit risk RWAs from negative credit migrat/i.righton, higher RWA on derivat/i.rightves and revolving credit facil/i.rightties led to approximately 60 basis point reduction in the CET1 ratio.\n\nThe Group had purchased 40 mill/i.righton ordinary shares for $242 mill/i.righton through the buy-back programme announced on 28 February 2020 which reduced the Group's CET1 ratio by approximately 10 basis points.\n\nFollowing the publicat/i.righton of recent PRA guidance, the Board has recommended a final ordinary div/i.rightdend of 9 cents per share or $284 mill/i.righton. The accrual of the 2020 final ordinary share div/i.rightdend reduced the year-end CET1 ratio by approximately 10 basis points.\n\nThe Board has also decided to carry out a share buy-back for up to a maximum considerat/i.righton of $254 mill/i.righton to further reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue by cancelling the repurchased shares. The terms of the buy-back will be announced and the programme will start shortly and is expected to reduce the Group's CET1 ratio in the first quarter of 2021 by approximately 10 basis points.\n\nThe UK leverage ratio remained at 5.2 per cent, sign/i.rightficantly above the Group's min/i.rightmum requirement of 3.6 per cent.\n\n## Outlook\n\nImproving prospects for COVID-19 vaccines should enable the global economy to transit/i.righton back to growth through 2021, with pre-pandemic growth rates re-emerging in most of/uni00A0our markets from 2022. We believe that our decis/i.righton to continue invest/i.rightng in the transformation of our business throughout the cris/i.rights will enable us to disproport/i.rightonately benefit from that recovery over time, not least because it will most likely be led by large markets in Asia where we generate two-thirds of our income.\n\nOverall income in 2021 is expected to be sim/i.rightlar to that achieved in 2020 at constant currency given the full-year impact of the global interest rate cuts that occurred in 1H'20, which will likely cause 1H'21 income to be lower than last year. The FY'21 net interest margin should stabil/i.rightse at marginally below the 4Q'20 level of 1.24 per cent. Our performance in the opening weeks of this year gives us the confidence that we are on the right track with strong performances in our less interest rate-sensit/i.rightve Financ/i.rightal Markets and Wealth Management businesses. We expect income to return to 5 to 7 per cent growth per annum from 2022.\n\nWe expect pressure on credit impa/i.rightrments to reduce this year compared with 2020. Expenses are likely to increase slightly in FY'21 as we continue to invest in our dig/i.righttal capabil/i.rightties but should remain below $10 bill/i.righton at constant currency and excluding the UK bank levy, supported in part by restructuring actions in 4Q'20 and through FY'21.\n\nWe will continue to manage our balance sheet prudently, particularly throughout the remainder of the pandemic. Our intent is to operate with/i.rightn our 13 to 14 per cent target CET1 range and we will seek approval to return to shareholders capital that cannot be deployed profitably with/i.rightn the business through a mixture of div/i.rightdends and share buy-backs.\n\nThe progress we were making up to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in every key financ/i.rightal and strategic metric gives us confidence that we can achieve our ambit/i.righton to deliver a double-dig/i.rightt RoTE. By 2023 we expect to deliver at least 7 per cent RoTE, higher if interest rates normalise earlier than antic/i.rightpated, through strong operating leverage and disc/i.rightplined capital management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Andy Halford\n\nGroup Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer 25 February 2021",

Uneven recovery trajector/i.rightes have resulted in volatil/i.rightty in growth rates across periods, although unprecedented levels of government support, and the provis/i.righton of sign/i.rightficant liqu/i.rightdity in most economies, has dampened some of the shock. The longer-term consequences of this volatil/i.rightty are unclear but suggest we are likely to see an inflat/i.rightonary period in the future. This has created unique challenges in terms of risk management as we strive to support our clients, colleagues and communit/i.rightes while ensuring we remain robust and resil/i.rightent.\n\nThe cris/i.rights has also required us to re-examine our systems and processes and adapt to new ways of working. We have accelerated some of our ongoing in/i.righttiat/i.rightves by invest/i.rightng sign/i.rightficantly in remote working and continu/i.rightng to enhance our operational resil/i.rightence. As we progress the Group's dig/i.righttal agenda we are conscious of the related cyber risks, as well as a heightened risk of fraud as crim/i.rightnals look to exploit the instab/i.rightlity caused by the pandemic.\n\nAs we look forward to 2021 and beyond, we remain vig/i.rightlant as the landscape continues to evolve, with the transit/i.righton from Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) to alternative risk-free rates and the longer-term impact of the Common Framework Agreement on emerging market debt being just two of the areas we are monitor/i.rightng closely.\n\nThe pandemic and related economic shock has impacted our loan portfolio, with credit impa/i.rightrment at elevated levels compared to 2019. However, we faced these challenges from a fundamentally strong posit/i.righton. Actions taken in previous years, includ/i.rightng reducing our concentration on single names and high-risk sectors and increas/i.rightng the proportion of investment grade assets, helped to mit/i.rightgate deteriorat/i.righton in our portfolios. Our capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.rightons have also remained resil/i.rightent.\n\nWhile there were improvements in the second half of 2020 as economies in many of our markets began to emerge from local restrict/i.rightons, we remain cognisant that the global recovery will be uneven with some sectors and markets continu/i.rightng to face challenges as the world adapts to the new normal.\n\nThe growing sentiment to 'build back better' during the recovery from COVID-19 means we can benefit from our expertise in creating sustainable finance solutions, often in collaboration with the public sector. We are working with clients to understand the potential risks and opportunit/i.rightes sustainab/i.rightlity brings. In the second half of 2020, we integrated environmental, social and governance risk management into our Reputational Risk Type Framework. We recognise our role in supporting our clients and markets in the transit/i.righton to a low-carbon economy and are focused on developing transit/i.righton frameworks and a range of sustainable financ/i.rightng solutions. We remain committed to being a sustainable, innovat/i.rightve, resil/i.rightent and client-centric bank.",

        "page_content": "## An update on our key risk prior/i.rightties\n\nThe financ/i.rightal services sector is evolving at a rapid pace and, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, we must continue to innovate. We remain focused on the following key prior/i.rightties.\n\nStrengthening the Group's risk culture: Embedding a healthy risk culture remains a core object/i.rightve across the Group. It underpins an enterprise-level abil/i.rightty to ident/i.rightfy and assess, openly discuss, and take prompt action to address exist/i.rightng and emerging risks. Our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) sets out the guid/i.rightng princ/i.rightples for our colleagues, enabling us to have integrated and holist/i.rightc risk conversations across the Group and the three lines of defence. Senior management promote a healthy risk culture by rewarding risk-based think/i.rightng (includ/i.rightng in remuneration decis/i.rightons), challenging the status quo and creating a transparent and safe environment for employees to communicate risk concerns.\n\n## Enhancing informat/i.righton and cyber security (ICS) capabil/i.rightties:\n\nThe Group continues to invest in ICS capabil/i.rightties. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, our technology infrastructure, supervis/i.righton and controls have been strengthened to meet the addit/i.rightonal requirements brought by the pandemic. The expansion of Virtual Private Network capacity along with Multi-Factor Authenticat/i.righton controls have facil/i.righttated a large increase in secure remote working across our footprint. We continue to review cyber threats as they evolve, antic/i.rightpating areas of risk and adapting our continu/i.rightty arrangements to mainta/i.rightn client service. These threats extend beyond the Group, and we have made it a prior/i.rightty to review our processes and strengthen controls around thirdparty security risk in response to recent external reports of ransomware attacks. We have benefited from an external review of our ICS enhancements.\n\nEmbedding climate risk management: We are making good progress on integrat/i.rightng climate risk into mainstream risk management, with some relevant Reputational, Compliance, Operational and Country Risk processes now incorporating Climate Risk. The Group is also conducting several pilot exercises to accelerate further integrat/i.righton into Credit, Traded, Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk. Governance has been enhanced and rolled out to regions, focusing on markets with local regulatory requirements.\n\nTrain/i.rightng and upskill/i.rightng colleagues across the Group has been a key prior/i.rightty. This year we delivered virtual train/i.rightng sessions and launched our first dig/i.righttal train/i.rightng course on climate risk under our partnership with Imperial College London. We also collaborated with them on a virtual event on energy scenarios and integrat/i.righton into macroeconomic and climate scenarios, with a focus on the coal supply chain in India.\n\nMeasuring climate risk remains an industry-wide challenge, and we have invested in internal capabil/i.rightties and external partnerships to tackle climate risk assessments. With Munich Re's toolkit for physical risk assessment, Baringa's solution for transit/i.righton risk assessment under various climate scenarios, and granular climate data from S&P Trucost, we sign/i.rightficantly advanced our climate risk quantif/i.rightcation capabil/i.rightties. In 2021, we plan to engage our corporate clients with our climate risk ins/i.rightghts, to better understand their adaptation and mit/i.rightgation plans and assess how to best serve their sustainable financ/i.rightng needs.\n\nOur 2020 Task Force on Climate-related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures Report provides further details on the Group's progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore details on the Group's approach to Climate Risk can be found at sc.com/sustainab/i.rightlity\n\n## Managing our environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\nrisk: There is increas/i.rightng focus on issues relating to ESG risks from regulators and investors, and we are committed to being a leader in sustainable and responsible banking. The expansion of our Reputational Risk Type Framework to integrate ESG risk management focuses on core princ/i.rightples aligned with the OECD's Due Dil/i.rightgence for Responsible Business Conduct and that of doing no sign/i.rightficant harm. We are invest/i.rightng in technology and innovat/i.rightve solutions in this area, having already developed a Reputational Risk and ESG Due Dil/i.rightgence Tool to enable us to better understand and manage ESG issues across our markets. We have also delivered a proof-of-concept model which util/i.rightses data on client behaviours combined with machine learning to predict the likel/i.righthood that a client relationsh/i.rightp would expose the Group to heightened ESG risk and its potential severity.\n\nManaging financ/i.rightal crime risks: We strive to remain at the forefront of the fight against financ/i.rightal crime. COVID-19 has presented a range of new threats, as well as heighten/i.rightng exist/i.rightng risks as crim/i.rightnals look to exploit the instab/i.rightlity caused by the pandemic. We have ident/i.rightfied and shared informat/i.righton about these threats and have taken steps to protect clients.\n\nOur control capabil/i.rightty has continued to strengthen and our Financ/i.rightal Crime Compliance team has ident/i.rightfied and prevented fraud, money laundering, bribery and corruption using next-generation surveillance and financ/i.rightal crime monitor/i.rightng infrastructure. With natural language processing and machine learning tools we generate higher quality cases and reduce false posit/i.rightves, creating a safer environment for our clients. We have also been able to share ins/i.rightghts with our clients, colleagues and partners. Despite the pandemic impact/i.rightng our abil/i.rightty to physically hold Correspondent Banking Academies, we have adapted and held academies virtually, allowing greater partic/i.rightpation and helping further promote de-risk/i.rightng through education. We have also continued to strengthen our controls through internal innovat/i.righton and investment in technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore informat/i.righton about the Group's commitment to fight/i.rightng financ/i.rightal crime can be found at sc.com/fight/i.rightngfinanc/i.rightalcrime\n\nStrengthening our conduct environment: We continued to enhance our management of conduct risk in 2020, particularly in our approach to ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and mit/i.rightgation. COVID-19 presented a range of new or heightened conduct risks given the move to large-scale working from home arrangements as well as the economic impact on clients. We focused on ensuring those risks were understood and mit/i.rightgated throughout the year.\n\nMore generally, we have seen an improvement in the overall quality and consistency in the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and management of conduct risk across the Group, regions and countries. Each area assesses its own operations to ident/i.rightfy conduct risks and create conduct plans to mit/i.rightgate them. The ownership of these plans sits with the first line and they are reviewed and challenged by the Conduct, Financ/i.rightal Crime and Compliance function (CFCC). We have also supplemented our management informat/i.righton and reporting by rolling out the Group Conduct Dashboard which provides conduct-related metrics at a firm-wide level.\n\nWe are mindful of new and emerging risks and continue to focus on ident/i.rightfying and mit/i.rightgating conduct risk aris/i.rightng from the pandemic. Given the expected diff/i.rightcult and uncertain nature of the recovery from COVID-19, we remain vig/i.rightlant to the need to ident/i.rightfy new ways conduct risk may arise in 2021 and beyond.",

        "page_content": "Enhancing our Risk and CFCC infrastructure: Flexible risk aggregation, centralised data and advanced analytical capabil/i.rightties have enabled an agile response to the challenges of COVID-19. The integrat/i.righton of our risk aggregation platform with front office data has enabled near real-time bespoke exposure analysis, decis/i.rightoning and reporting, and our stress testing scenarios have been expanded to include the impact of the pandemic. We have also developed capabil/i.rightties in areas such as anti-money laundering, ident/i.rightty verif/i.rightcation, and dig/i.righttal signatures through partnerships developed by our internal innovat/i.righton centre, SC Ventures.\n\nIn Retail Banking, the use of more sophist/i.rightcated data min/i.rightng and predict/i.rightve analytics tools has accelerated development and deployment of risk and forecasting models. Hubs have been established to centralise special/i.rightst knowledge in data engineer/i.rightng and visual/i.rightsation, model development, validat/i.righton and governance, with automation of supporting processes to reduce operational risks.\n\nEnhancing our model risk management: During 2020, we focused on deliver/i.rightng a sustainable risk management framework through the Model Risk Management Strategic Enhancement Programme. Model Risk Policy and Standards have been strengthened to enable a risk-based approach and an enhanced set of Risk Appetite metrics has been approved by the Board.\n\nThe launch of a Model Risk e-learning module is aimed at increas/i.rightng awareness of model risk management among our people. The Group Model Inventory has been enhanced under a new platform to improve its technological capabil/i.rightty and operations. We constantly review our target operating model to ensure we have the right resources and skillsets for timely delivery. This will continue to be an area of focus with more model redevelopment and validat/i.righton to be completed in 2021.\n\n## Our risk profile and performance in 2020\n\nCOVID-19 and the related economic shock has impacted our loan portfolio, and as a result asset quality has deteriorated over the past year. However, actions taken as the cris/i.rights unfolded and the work done in previous years to solid/i.rightfy our foundations have helped to mit/i.rightgate the impact. Our capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.rightons remain strong.\n\nThe incorporation of COVID-19 into our stress scenarios and portfolio reviews of exposures most at risk to the economic downturn have allowed us to proactively ident/i.rightfy potential areas of vulnerabil/i.rightty and manage them accordingly.\n\nWe remain cognisant that the recovery will be uneven globally, and the threat of prolonged weak economic outlooks may lead to a sustained period of increased risk aversion and uncertainty.\n\nIn the first half of the year we placed selected clients from vulnerable sectors on our watchlist categories for close monitor/i.rightng. This led to a $5.4 bill/i.righton increase in early alerts exposure (2020: $10.7 bill/i.righton; 2019: $5.3 bill/i.righton), although there was a decrease in the second half of the year due to reductions in exposure, regularisat/i.rightons, and downgrades. Credit Grade 12 loans have increased to $2.2 bill/i.righton (2019: $1.6 bill/i.righton) as outflows to non-performing loans were offset by inflows from early alert categories.\n\nThe credit impa/i.rightrment charge was sign/i.rightficantly higher at $2.3 bill/i.righton compared to $0.9 bill/i.righton in 2019. Increases were seen across all stages, with stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment ris/i.rightng partly due to management overlays to reflect expected future deteriorat/i.righton. Stage 3 impa/i.rightrment increased by $0.8 bill/i.righton to\n\n$1.5 bill/i.righton, with around one third relating to three unrelated downgrades in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nOverall, gross credit-impa/i.rightred (stage 3) loans for the Group increased by 25 per cent in 2020, from $7.4 bill/i.righton to $9.2 bill/i.righton, driven by downgrades in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking in the ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle East regions. Retail Banking saw an increase of $0.3 bill/i.righton in stage 3.\n\nThe stage 3 cover ratio in the total customer loan book decreased by 10 percentage points to 58 per cent (2019: 68 per cent) mainly in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking. This was driven by write-offs and new stage 3 loans with low levels of coverage, which benefit from credit insurance and guarantees, includ/i.rightng from export credit agencies. The/uni00A0cover ratio includ/i.rightng tangible collateral decreased to/uni00A076/uni00A0per cent (2019: 85 per cent) with some of the 2020 downgrades being covered by guarantees and insurance which are not included as tangible collateral.\n\nAverage Group value at risk (VaR) in 2020 was $108 mill/i.righton, a/uni00A0sign/i.rightficant increase compared with the previous year (2019:/uni00A0$30 mill/i.righton), driven by the extreme market volatil/i.rightty in interest rates and credit spreads following the outbreak of COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices. The increase in VaR was predominantly observed in the non-trading book from credit bonds held in the Treasury Markets liqu/i.rightd assets buffer which are almost exclusively of investment grade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the Group's risk performance for 2020 are set out in the Risk update (pages 182 to 184) and the Risk profile section (pages 185 to 247)\n\n## An update on our risk management approach\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Management Framework outlines how we manage risk across the Group, as well as at branch and subsid/i.rightary level. It gives us the structure to manage exist/i.rightng risks effectively in line with our Risk Appetite, as well as allowing for holist/i.rightc risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton. In the first half of the year we introduced a number of enhancements includ/i.rightng the elevation of Model Risk to a Princ/i.rightpal Risk Type (PRT), as well as refreshes of the Risk Type Frameworks for Information and Cyber Security Risk and Operational Risk. These changes have been rolled out and further embedded in the second half of the year.\n\nAs part of the annual review of the ERMF we have expanded the Reputational Risk PRT to include Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk. There is an increas/i.rightng focus on issues relating to ESG risk from both regulators and investors, and the Group's commitments to be a leader in sustainable and responsible banking make this is a core tenet of our franchise.\n\nGiven its overarching nature, conduct risk management has been incorporated as an integral component of the overall ERMF rather than viewed as a standalone risk, effective from January 2021. The Group will continue to ident/i.rightfy conduct risks inherent to the Group's strategy, business model and geographies it operates in, and expects each business and function to be responsible for managing conduct with/i.rightn their area with CFCC provid/i.rightng oversight and challenge. This change allows us to view conduct risk through the lens of deliver/i.rightng posit/i.rightve outcomes for our clients, markets, and internal and external stakeholders. We remain committed to ensuring the highest standard of conduct from all our people. We have no appetite for negative conduct risk outcomes aris/i.rightng from negligent or wilful actions by the Group or ind/i.rightviduals recognis/i.rightng that while inc/i.rightdents are unwanted, they cannot be entirely avoided.",

This includes economic, polit/i.rightcal, environmental and social risk factors under base and stressed condit/i.rightons. The Credit Risk PRT will continue to refer and rely on sovereign risk ratings managed through the Country Risk management process.\n\nTo meet the needs of the dig/i.righttal agenda and strengthen the technology risk management capabil/i.rightties of the Group, we have expanded the Operational Risk PRT to include Technology Risk, effective from January 2021. This allows us to focus on risks aris/i.rightng from technology events, with the Operational Risk team provid/i.rightng second-line oversight.

The list is not exhaustive and there may be addit/i.rightonal risks which could have an adverse effect on the Group. Our mit/i.rightgation approach for these risks may not elim/i.rightnate them, but shows the Group's attempt to reduce or manage the risk. As certain risks develop and material/i.rightse over time, management will take appropriate steps to mit/i.rightgate the risk based on its impact on the Group.\n\nClimate related transit/i.righton and physical risks have been removed as an emerging risk as Climate Risk is now classif/i.righted as a cross-cutting risk.

We also launched an e-learning module on client vulnerabil/i.rightty awareness to help retail banking employees support our more vulnerable clients.\n\nDig/i.righttal transformation of our business meant we were able to help clients bank from home. This included the launch of our new dig/i.righttal Bank in Hong Kong, Mox, and the rollout of e-signature capabil/i.rightties for our corporate clients.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to strengthen our dig/i.righttal transformation and innovat/i.righton capabil/i.rightties.\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Different/i.rightated product and service offering\n- \u00b7 Dig/i.righttally enabled and posit/i.rightve experience\n- \u00b7 Sustainable finance\n\n## Princ/i.rightpal Board decis/i.righton: Div/i.rightdend and share buy-back withdrawal\n\nThe interests of stakeholders are central to the Board's capital management decis/i.righton-making. An example of this was the Board's decis/i.righton to withdraw the recommendation to pay a final div/i.rightdend for 2019 and suspend the buy-back programme announced earlier in the year.\n\nIn line with the Group's approach to div/i.rightdend growth and capital returns, the Board had previously agreed to carry out a share buy-back for up to a maximum considerat/i.righton of $0.5 bill/i.righton to reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue by cancelling the repurchased shares. In addit/i.righton, the Board had declared a final ordinary div/i.rightdend for 2019 of 20 cents. At the time it agreed that both decis/i.rightons were in the best interests of the Group and its stakeholders.\n\nIn response to a request from the Prudential Regulation Authority and as a consequence of the unprecedented challenges facing the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group announced on 31 March 2020 that, after careful considerat/i.righton, the Board had decided to withdraw the recommendation to pay a final div/i.rightdend for 2019 and to suspend the buy-back programme.\n\nAs part of the considerat/i.righton process for this decis/i.righton, the Board discussed the impact and views of key stakeholders includ/i.rightng our regulators, and recognised the importance of div/i.rightdends to our shareholders. However, the Board decided that suspending shareholder distr/i.rightbutions at the time would allow the Group to maxim/i.rightse its support for ind/i.rightviduals, businesses and the communit/i.rightes in which it operates while at the same time preserving strong capital ratios and invest/i.rightng to transform the business for the long term. One such example of this was the launch of a $50 mill/i.righton global fund to provide assistance to those affected by COVID-19. The Group made a contribut/i.righton of $25 mill/i.righton and announced that it would match other contribut/i.rightons includ/i.rightng those made by its employees and confirmed it would make further contribut/i.rightons as needed to reach the total. It was announced that Board and Management Team members would be making personal contribut/i.rightons to the fund. The Board welcomed the in/i.righttiat/i.rightve, the approach and leadership management had taken in launching the fund.",

Given the advances in technology and the changing needs of our clients, we are using long-term workforce planning to build the skills and culture necessary for a future ready-workforce.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nBy engaging employees and fostering a posit/i.rightve experience for them, we can better serve our clients and deliver on our purpose. An inclus/i.rightve culture enables us to unlock innovat/i.righton, make better decis/i.rightons, deliver our business strategy, live our valued behaviours, and embody our brand promise Here for good.\n\nWe proactively assess and manage people-related risks, for example, organisat/i.righton, capabil/i.rightty, and culture, as part of our Group risk management framework. Our People Strategy, as approved by the Board in July 2019, remains in place and COVID-19 has accelerated many of the future of work trends which informed our approach.\n\n## Their interests\n\nIn 2018, we conducted research to understand our Employee Value Proposit/i.righton (EVP) - the value that employees, or potential employees, feel they gain from being part of our organisat/i.righton. Our employees told us they want to: have interest/i.rightng and impactful jobs; innovate with/i.rightn a unique set of markets and clients; cultivate a brand that sustainably drives commerce and offers enrich/i.rightng careers and development; and be supported by great people leaders. They want these elements to be anchored in competit/i.rightve rewards and a posit/i.rightve work-life balance. The EVP is a key input to our People Strategy which supports the delivery of our business strategy.\n\n## Listen/i.rightng to employees\n\nFeedback from employee surveys helps us ident/i.rightfy and close gaps between employees' expectations and experience. A pulse survey in April 2020 revealed how employees were coping with COVID-19 and allowed us to target support where it was needed most. This was followed by our annual survey, My Voice, in June and July. On a par with previous years, 74,566 employees (91 per cent), and a further 3,599 agency workers (71 per cent) took part.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group KPI:\n\nEmployee engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) +5.4%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |       | 1 7. 5 1   |\n|--------|-------|------------|\n|   2019 | 11.51 |            |\n|   2018 | 11.3  |            |\n\neNPS measures the number of promoters (who would recommend the Group as a great place to/uni00A0work) compared to detractors on a scale from -100 to +100.

Externally, this is reflected in a 27 per cent increase in LinkedIn followers since December 2019 (1.27 mill/i.righton), and 77 per cent of Glassdoor ratings stating that they would recommend working at the Bank to a friend.\n\nMy Voice also revealed a commitment among employees to doing what is required to help us succeed (97 per cent), and increas/i.rightng satisfact/i.righton with job impact (up 6 per cent), reward (up 6 per cent) and development opportunit/i.rightes (up 5 per cent) - all ind/i.rightcators that we are deliver/i.rightng our EVP. Investment in people leader capabil/i.rightty has translated into a 10/uni00A0per cent increase in our manager net promoter scores, which is important as the variety of demands on our people leaders to engage with dynamic workforce needs are increas/i.rightng.\n\nDuring 2020, new ways of working brought greater freedoms and benefits for some colleagues; for many, however, physical restrict/i.rightons and a lack of social connection sign/i.rightficantly affected their wellbeing - 40 per cent of our employees said they were experienc/i.rightng high or frequent levels of work-related stress. We are continu/i.rightng to invest in wellbeing tools such as a mental health app, an upgraded employee assistance service, wellbeing toolkits for employees and people leaders, and learning programmes on mental health and resil/i.rightence. The pandemic has reinforced how important our health and wellbeing strategy is, and supporting employees with these skills is a long-term area of focus.\n\nWe are also listen/i.rightng to employees' preferences for greater flexib/i.rightlity in working arrangements post-pandemic, with 80 per cent of employees in our nine largest markets telling us they would like some form of flexib/i.rightlity. We recognise the posit/i.rightve lessons that can be learnt from the pandemic on productiv/i.rightty, employee experience and talent attraction and retention. Conversely, enforced absence from offices has highl/i.rightghted the benefit of face-to-face interact/i.righton and the value of physical workspaces as hubs of teamwork, collaboration and learning. Based on this data we are introduc/i.rightng a hybrid model, combin/i.rightng virtual and officebased working with greater flexib/i.rightlity in working patterns and locations.\n\nThe Board listens to the views of the workforce through several sources, includ/i.rightng informat/i.righton reported from senior management on culture and directly via workforce engagement sessions. More informat/i.righton can be found on pages 105 to 106 in the Directors' Report.\n\n## Developing skills of future strategic value\n\nThe world of work continues to change rapidly. Our employees need a combinat/i.righton of personal and technical skills to succeed both today and in the future.\n\nIn 2020, we focused on laying the foundations for upskill/i.rightng and re-skill/i.rightng our workforce by build/i.rightng a culture of continuous learning. Our learning intens/i.rightfied during the pandemic and we virtual/i.rightsed all appropriate programmes and sessions. Currently, 67 per cent of employees have a growth plan and we expect this to increase as we deepen our culture of continuous learning.\n\nIn support of this shift in skills, we have ident/i.rightfied a core set of new roles and are developing exist/i.rightng talent to take up these posit/i.rightons. This approach unites our recruitment, talent management and learning efforts to target, upskill and place learners into new roles. This will be piloted in 2021 across five roles before being extended across the Group.\n\n## Creating an inclus/i.rightve culture\n\nThere is no doubt that 2020 was a challenging year, and the need to lead inclus/i.rightvely was a central theme for our people leaders. Our commitment to D&I is supported by more than 60 employee resource groups (ERGs) that help create a culture of inclus/i.righton and provide learning, development and networking opportunit/i.rightes. The ERGs align to our focus areas of gender, ethnic/i.rightty and national/i.rightty, generations, sexual orientat/i.righton, and disab/i.rightlity and wellbeing.\n\nOur gender divers/i.rightty is growing with more female leaders coming through the pipel/i.rightne. Currently, females represent 31 per cent of the Board, increas/i.rightng to 36 per cent in January 2021. Fourteen of our markets have female CEOs, and female representation in senior leadership roles increased by 1 per cent to 29.5 per cent at the end of 2020. We are committed to improv/i.rightng, and aspire to 35 per cent female representation at senior level by 2025. This Aspirat/i.righton is supported by programmes that develop our talent in preparation for future roles.\n\n\u00aa\n\n## Learn anywhere, anytime\u00ba\n\nIn March 2020 we launched our new dig/i.righttal learning platform, diSCover, to make learning accessible to all. Aligned to our future skills academies, it uses artif/i.rightcial intell/i.rightgence (AI) to create personalised content. We have had over 55,000 users, of which 80 per cent are active. Partic/i.rightpation in our second global learning week (over 500 events and 21,000 partic/i.rightpants) both demonstrated and galvanised our employees' appetite for learning.",

This was supported by 94 per cent of our people leaders completing our Inclusive Leadership programme.\n\nIn addit/i.righton to six key D&I dates we recognise across the year, several external events helped increase awareness of inclus/i.righton and equality. In response to global Black Lives Matter protests, we ran a series of listen/i.rightng and engagement sessions on race involv/i.rightng employees, people leaders, the Management Team and Board members. We shared our guide on having conversations about race externally, to further support our clients and communit/i.rightes. We signed the UK Business in the Community - Race at Work Charter, to tackle barriers facing ethnic minor/i.rightty talent, and partnered with Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America to divers/i.rightfy the leadership pipel/i.rightne.

In response, we became the first bank to publish a framework and global standards to support colleagues, and a toolkit to share best practice with other organisat/i.rightons.\n\nIn line with our Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons, all markets with 50 or more employees have completed our internal Disab/i.rightlity Confident Assessment to help us focus on removing barriers and increas/i.rightng accessib/i.rightlity.\n\n\u00aa\n\n## Ignit/i.rightng our talent through coaching\u00ba\n\nThrough an experimental 'pay it forward' coaching programme, 'IGNITE', we have accredited 51 internal coaches who have in return provided coaching to 141 female employees in 18 countries. We have extended this to 119 further coaches, with the aim for ind/i.rightviduals to explore their potential, discover new levels of performance and experience community from the peer network.\n\nGroup Chief Executive, Bill Winters, signed the UN Global Standards for Business to tackle discr/i.rightminat/i.righton against lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex (LGBT+) people. In addit/i.righton, we developed a toolkit on transgender inclus/i.righton in the workplace, issued guidance on how to be an ally, and offered medical and domestic relocation benefits to LGBT+ partners of employees in India.\n\nOur progress is also recognised externally. We are among the top 100 organisat/i.rightons in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and ranked as a Divers/i.rightty Leader in the Financ/i.rightal Times report on Divers/i.rightty and Inclusion in Europe. We were the first financ/i.rightal inst/i.righttution in Singapore to be granted the Economic Div/i.rightdends for Gender Equality certif/i.rightcation. Seven of our D&I champions were recognised by Yahoo Finance HERoes awards for their contribut/i.rightons to gender equality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our approach to tackling domestic violence at\n\nsc.com/tacklingdomest/i.rightcabuse and sc.com/toolkitdomest/i.rightcabuse\n\n- Read more about our ethnic/i.rightty targets at sc.com/ethnic/i.rightty and access our toolkit for conversations about race at sc.com/toolkitrace\n\n## Princ/i.rightpal Board decis/i.righton: Sustainab/i.rightlity as a pillar of our overall strategy\n\nStakeholder interests are a key considerat/i.righton during Board decis/i.righton-making. This includes decis/i.rightons regarding the Group's purpose, values and strategy. An illustrat/i.righton of this is the Board's decis/i.righton to make sustainab/i.rightlity a pillar of our overall strategy.\n\nOur refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties link directly to our purpose to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique divers/i.rightty. An important aspect of this is the way in which we approach sustainab/i.rightlity in our own operations, in our communit/i.rightes and in how we conduct our business. During 2020, management presented to the Board a proposed near-to-medium term roadmap to build upon our exist/i.rightng sustainab/i.rightlity credentials and raise our profile with stakeholders, which the Board considered and agreed to.\n\nAs part of the considerat/i.righton of this decis/i.righton, the Board received material prepared by colleagues from across the organisat/i.righton includ/i.rightng our Sustainab/i.rightlity, Corporate Affairs,\n\nBrand & Marketing, Risk and Business teams, as well as appropriate client segments. The material included, among other relevant informat/i.righton, considerat/i.righton of key stakeholder groups includ/i.rightng our colleagues, clients, communit/i.rightes, civ/i.rightl society, regulators, and investors. The Board recognised the increased client demand for sustainable finance products, the potential for Standard Chartered to play a dist/i.rightnct role in enabling capital flows to the markets where it matters most, and noted that sustainab/i.rightlity is an increas/i.rightngly high prior/i.rightty for other key stakeholders.\n\nAs part of consider/i.rightng and agreeing the proposed sustainab/i.rightlity strategy, the Board highl/i.rightghted the sign/i.rightficance of the Group communicat/i.rightng its sustainab/i.rightlity successes to its stakeholders through enhanced disclosure and communicat/i.righton plans.\n\nFurther detail regarding the Group's refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties can be found throughout the Strategic report.",

The gender pay gap compares the average pay of men and women without accounting for some of the key factors which influence pay, includ/i.rightng different roles, skills, senior/i.rightty and market pay rates. Our gender pay gaps are caused by there being fewer women in senior roles and in business areas where market rates of pay are highest.\n\nWith the exception of the mean hourly pay gap in UAE and the mean bonus pay gap in the UK, our mean gender pay gaps have remained flat or reduced across all five markets. We understand it will take time to see the level of change needed to sign/i.rightficantly reduce our gender pay gaps and we remain committed to our in/i.righttiat/i.rightves to support gender divers/i.rightty.\n\nWhen the pay of men and women at the same level and in the same business area are compared, our gender pay gaps are sign/i.rightficantly smaller. The remain/i.rightng gaps exist due to differences in the market pay level for different types of roles at the same level and in the same business areas, and differences in the relative posit/i.rightoning of the pay of each role holder around the market benchmark.\n\nEqual pay is a more detailed measure of pay equality and is a key commitment in our Fair Pay Charter. We analyse equal pay during our annual performance and pay review process to ensure equal pay for equal work.\n\nWe have been reporting our gender pay gaps for a number of years and support in/i.righttiat/i.rightves that will enable a truly diverse workforce. We responded to the UK Government consultation on ethnic/i.rightty pay gap reporting and are consider/i.rightng potential ways to draw from available data to inform our inclus/i.righton strategy. Obtain/i.rightng sign/i.rightficant enough disclosure of ethnic/i.rightty data remains a challenge and we are taking steps to encourage disclosure, where possible, so we can develop our approach.\n\n| 2020 Gender pay gap   | UK   | Hong Kong   | Singapore   | UAE   | US   |\n|-----------------------|------|-------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Mean hourly pay gap   | 30%  | 20%         | 34%         | 29%   | 25%  |\n| Mean bonus pay gap    | 51%  | 35%         | 44%         | 52%   | 43%  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about this in our gender pay gap report at sc.com/genderpaygap\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our seven Posit/i.righton Statements outline the cross-sector standards we expect of ourselves and our clients, as well as sector-specif/i.rightc guidance for clients operating in sectors with a high potential environmental or social impact. The statements draw on International Finance Corporation Performance Standards, the Equator Princ/i.rightples (EP) and global best practice. Our prohib/i.rightted activ/i.rightties list sets out what we do not finance and can be found at sc.com/prohib/i.righttedactiv/i.rightties.\n\nWe ident/i.rightfy and assess environmental and social risks related to our Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal, Commercial and Business Banking clients, and embed our risk framework directly into our credit approval process. All relationsh/i.rightp managers and credit officers are offered train/i.rightng in assessing environmental and social risk against our criter/i.righta and have access to online resources.\n\nIn 2020, we launched an online learning tool to increase awareness of environmental and social risk management among client-facing employees. This train/i.rightng will become a mandatory for relevant employees in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, we reviewed 1,090 transactions that presented potential specif/i.rightc risks against our Posit/i.righton Statements. We also reviewed all our Posit/i.righton Statements, and refreshed documents will be released in 2021.\n\nWe work with clients, regulators and peers across the finance sector to continuously improve environmental and social standards. We proactively engage with clients to mit/i.rightgate risks and help them improve their environmental and social performance over time. Where this is not possible, transactions have been, and will continue to be, turned down.\n\nWe also achieved a number of milestones under our Chairmansh/i.rightp of the EP Associat/i.righton in 2020. These include the launch of the EP Associat/i.righton Strategy, publish/i.rightng guidance on implement/i.rightng EP during the pandemic, and publish/i.rightng guidance on implement/i.rightng EP4 includ/i.rightng specif/i.rightc notes on climate change and human rights and ind/i.rightgenous people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our reporting against the Equator Princ/i.rightples: sc.com/equatorprinc/i.rightples\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00aa\n\n## Responding to climate change\n\nWe consider climate change to be one of the greatest challenges facing the world today.\n\nSince 2018, we have been working on align/i.rightng the emiss/i.rightons from both our own operations and our financ/i.rightng activ/i.rightties to the Paris Agreement goal of below two degrees of global warming. In 2019, we set a target to achieve net zero emiss/i.rightons from our operations by 2030 and have made a strong start towards achiev/i.rightng this goal.\n\nIn 2020, we made strides towards bring/i.rightng the management of climate change as a financ/i.rightal and non-financ/i.rightal risk with/i.rightn key Princ/i.rightpal Risk Frameworks to the mainstream. This included extending climate risk governance across our markets and client segments.\n\nWe acknowledge that climate change is a shared global challenge and believe collaboration with clients, peer banks, industry experts and regulators is crucial. In 2020, we launched a four-year partnership with Imperial College London, through which we aim to strengthen our own resil/i.rightence to climate risk and support our clients through their own low-carbon transit/i.rightons. In December, we sponsored Imperial's research report and public webinar focused on energy transit/i.rightons and the coal supply chain in India, designed to generate ins/i.rightghts for financ/i.rightal inst/i.righttutions and policymakers.\n\nWe also formed partnerships with Baringa and Munich Re to develop bespoke tools to strengthen our risk management infrastructure in response to the various regulatory requirements and forthcoming stress tests.\n\nTo build internal knowledge, we launched a Sustainable Finance Academy and new dig/i.righttal learning programmes for climate risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have made disclosures consistent with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures in a dedicated, standalone report.

This can be accessed at sc.com/tcfd .\n\n## Sustainable lending to EcoGreen\u00ba\n\nAs part of our sustainable finance efforts, we arranged EcoGreen's first ever green loan. The China-based company, which produces chemicals using botanic essential oils from plants for the pharmaceutical, household, healthcare and personal care industr/i.rightes, borrowed $185 mill/i.righton in 2020.

However, there was a decline in the use of Speaking Up in mid-2020 when pandemic working arrangements were in place. We believe this to be in line with peers and due to home working reducing vis/i.rightbil/i.rightty of misconduct, and more communicat/i.rightons over recorded platforms rather than face-to-face.\n\nDuring the period, 338 cases were closed following invest/i.rightgation (these included cases raised in 2020 as well as those raised in prior years), of which 206 were substantiated while 132 were closed as unsubstantiated.\n\nA range of corrective actions were taken, includ/i.rightng process improvements, targeted coaching and train/i.rightng and, for 63 cases, disc/i.rightplinary actions ranging from verbal or written warning to dism/i.rightssals.\n\nResults from our 2020 My Voice survey demonstrate confidence in the programme with 87 per cent of employees confirm/i.rightng they would be comfortable in speaking up if they see a violat/i.righton of Standard Chartered's polic/i.rightes, valued behaviours or the Code. However, this was marginally down from 91 per cent in 2019. We are working to improve our Speaking Up programme by partnering with a leading whistleblow/i.rightng charity to provide an advice hotline and increas/i.rightng the number of advocates who work with country management teams to support employees. In 2021, we will also be rolling out an enhanced framework to ident/i.rightfy and support staff who are at high risk of being vict/i.rightmised for speaking up.",

By cutting off funding sources, we help make the financ/i.rightal system a hostile environment for crim/i.rightnals and support posit/i.rightve economic development in our markets.\n\nWe have safeguards in place to address threats includ/i.rightng money laundering, terrorist financ/i.rightng, sanctions compliance breaches, bribery and other forms of corruption. Our Conduct, Financ/i.rightal Crime & Compliance (CFCC) team leads our risk management activ/i.rightties, which include adhering to antimoney laundering and sanctions polic/i.rightes and applying controls such as client due-dil/i.rightgence screening and monitor/i.rightng. See the Risk review section on page 256 for more on how we manage Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk.\n\nIn 2020, due to COVID-19, we ident/i.rightfied a new range of emerging risks. Our CFCC experts were able to ident/i.rightfy red flags in relation to fraud, money laundering, bribery and corruption. Our in-depth knowledge allows us to share ins/i.rightghts with our clients, employees and partners. Despite the pandemic impact/i.rightng our abil/i.rightty to physically hold Correspondent Banking Academies, we held academies virtually - allowing greater partic/i.rightpation. Besides our response to the pandemic we have continued to strengthen our controls by invest/i.rightng in innovat/i.righton and technology.\n\nAnti-bribery and corruption (ABC) polic/i.rightes aim to prevent employees, or third parties working on our behalf, from partic/i.rightpating in active or passive bribery or corruption, or from making facil/i.righttation payments. In 2020, 99.9 per cent of employees completed ABC, anti-money laundering and sanctions and fraud train/i.rightng. By working with our client banks, we share best practice on controls for managing Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk and are able to build a strong network to keep crim/i.rightnal activ/i.rightty out of the financ/i.rightal system. In 2020, we surpassed our Aspirat/i.righton for financ/i.rightal crime compliance, deliver/i.rightng 18 train/i.rightng sessions to more than 2,900 people from more than 500 client banks in 70 countries through our Correspondent Banking Academies.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to adapt our controls to emerging threats by making sure we have highly trained and experienced employees working with new technology to detect abuse of the financ/i.rightal system. We will also continue to partner with, and educate, peer banks and clients to help them detect financ/i.rightal crime risks.\n\nFight/i.rightng financ/i.rightal crime\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more vis/i.rightt\n\nsc.com/fight/i.rightngfinanc/i.rightalcrime\n\n## Respecting human rights\n\nWe are committed to respecting human rights and ensuring they are not adversely impacted in our role as an employer, financ/i.rightal services provider and procurer of goods and services. We recognise that our footprint and supply chain give us the opportunity to raise awareness of human rights and modern slavery in a wide range of markets and industr/i.rightes.\n\nOur Posit/i.righton Statement on Human Rights outlines our approach, reflecting frameworks includ/i.rightng the International Bill of Human Rights, the UN Guid/i.rightng Princ/i.rightples and the UK Modern Slavery Act.

In 2020, this included an update of our framework and processes with/i.rightn our supply chain, and a feasib/i.rightlity analysis on extending our liv/i.rightng wage commitment to non-employed and third-party workers.\n\nIn 2020, we began a review of our Human Rights Posit/i.righton Statement which informs our polic/i.rightes in this area.

We do not produce or handle material quantit/i.rightes of this and therefore do not report on it.\n\nOur reporting criter/i.righta set out the princ/i.rightples and methodology for measuring our emiss/i.rightons. Our Scope 1 and 2 emiss/i.rightons, as well as water and waste data, are independently assured by Global Documentation.\n\nThrough our Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons, we have set ambit/i.rightous targets to achieve net zero emiss/i.rightons and only use renewable energy sources by 2030.

The directors will continue to monitor and consider the appropriateness of this period.\n\nThe directors have reviewed the Corporate Plan, the output of the Group's formalised process of budgeting and strategic planning. For the 2021 Corporate Plan, the forward-looking cash flows and balances include the longer-term impact of COVID-19, specif/i.rightcally with regards to expected credit loss and the impact of global lower interest rates impact on revenues. The Corporate Plan is evaluated and approved each year by the Board with confirmat/i.righton from the Group Chief Risk Officer that the Plan is aligned with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Group Risk Appetite Statement and considers the Group's future project/i.rightons of profitab/i.rightlity, cash flows, capital requirements and resources, liqu/i.rightdity ratios and other key financ/i.rightal and regulatory ratios over the period. The Corporate Plan details the Group's key performance measures, of forecast profit, CET 1 capital ratio forecast, return on tangible equity forecasts, cost to income ratio forecasts and cash investment project/i.rightons. The Board has reviewed the ongoing performance management process of the Group by comparing the statutory results to the budgets and Corporate Plan.\n\nThe Group performs enterprise-wide stress tests using a range of bespoke hypothetical scenarios that explore the resil/i.rightence of the Group to shocks to its balance sheet and business model.\n\nTo assess the Group's balance sheet vulnerabil/i.rightties and capital and liqu/i.rightdity adequacy, severe but plausible macro-financ/i.rightal scenarios explore shocks that trigger one or more of:\n\n- \u00b7 Global slowdowns, includ/i.rightng a China hard landing with spillovers with/i.rightn Asia and more broadly via financ/i.rightal and other linkages\n- \u00b7 Sharp falls in world trade volumes, includ/i.rightng the effects of an extreme worsening in and broadening of recent trade tensions.\n- \u00b7 Material and persistent declines in commodity prices\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal market turbulence, includ/i.rightng a generalised sharp fall in risky asset prices\n\nThis year, the primary focus has been on the evolving macrofinanc/i.rightal stress caused by the response of governments, businesses and ind/i.rightviduals to COVID-19, with scenario analysis focused on mild, moderate, severe and extreme variants across the Group's footprint markets to ensure that the Group has suffic/i.rightent capital to withstand this shock.\n\nUnder this range of scenarios, the results of these stress tests demonstrate that the Group has suffic/i.rightent capital and liqu/i.rightdity to continue as a going concern and meet regulatory min/i.rightmum capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements.\n\nTo assess the Group's business model vulnerabil/i.rightties, extreme and unlikely scenarios are explored that, by design, result in the Group's business model no longer being viable. Insights from these reverse stress tests can inform strategy, risk management and capital and liqu/i.rightdity planning.\n\nFurther informat/i.righton on stress testing is provided in the Risk management approach section (page 251).\n\nThe Board Risk Committee ('BRC') exercises oversight on behalf of the Board of the key risks of the Group and makes recommendations to the Board on the Group's Risk Appetite Statement. These risks include, amongst others; credit, traded, capital and liqu/i.rightdity, operational and technology, reputational and sustainab/i.rightlity, compliance, informat/i.righton and cyber security and model risks.\n\nThe BRC receives regular reports that inform it of the Group's key risks, as well as updates on the macroeconomic environment, geo-polit/i.rightcal outlook, market developments, and regulatory updates in relation to capital, liqu/i.rightdity and risk. A report on COVID-19 risks was received and discussed at each meeting. In 2020, the BRC had deeper discuss/i.rightons on: Blue Sky Think/i.rightng/Horizon Scanning, Aviat/i.righton Finance, Enterprise Risk Review function, Safety and Security Risk, Climate Risk management, Technology Obsolescence, Client Service Resil/i.rightence and Operational Resil/i.rightence, Wholesale Credit, Transit/i.righton from IBOR to risk-free rates, CCIB Fraud Risk Review and SC Ventures - Venture Build/i.rightng.",

As COVID-19 and geopolit/i.rightcal events evolved across our footprint, the Board accelerated its interact/i.rightons to ensure it was kept updated on the potential impact of the pandemic on our clients, communit/i.rightes, colleagues and our shareholders, whilst mainta/i.rightning effective Board oversight and good corporate governance.\n\nDespite the multifaceted uncertaint/i.rightes externally, the Board continued to prior/i.righttise making Standard Chartered more profitable and resil/i.rightent, focusing on deliver/i.rightng safe and sustainable growth. During the year, we discussed and approved our Corporate Plan and refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties which set rightly ambit/i.rightous, but achievable steps to make this possible. This requires a careful balancing act between business opportunit/i.rightes on the one hand, and risks and controls on the other. Ensuring good conduct and a culture of transparency and trust across the Group are also crit/i.rightcal to the effective delivery of our strategic object/i.rightves.\n\nThe Board also spent considerable time discuss/i.rightng a number of material issues during the year. These included the withdrawal of the 2019 final div/i.rightdend and share buy-back, our ongoing response to COVID-19 and the support provided to clients, colleagues and communit/i.rightes, US/China relations, geopolit/i.rightcal and sanction challenges in relation to Hong Kong, changes in the risk profile resulting from COVID-19, and the delivery of our dig/i.righttal ambit/i.rightons.\n\nThe Board adapted rapidly to new ways of working, quickly adopting new technology for virtual meetings which were held frequently as the Board continued to monitor the evolving impact of COVID-19 across our markets. This required sign/i.rightficant change to planned Board agendas given the various markets in our footprint and locations of Board members. The Board worked hard to ensure that all items on the forward plan were covered during the year, includ/i.rightng train/i.rightng and external speakers to share perspectives on matters of sign/i.rightficant strategic or geopolit/i.rightcal importance. The corporate governance summary on pages 90 to 107 highl/i.rightghts the sign/i.rightficant breadth of topics and meetings held over the year and our progress against the Board action plan.\n\nAs the impact of the pandemic continued, we stepped up our engagement with our shareholders. In November, I hosted a virtual\n\nInvestor Stewardship event, jo/i.rightned by all of our Committee Chairs and inst/i.righttutional investors representing a sizeable proportion of our equity, as well as several shareholder representative bodies. We updated investors on the key activ/i.rightties and areas of focus for the Board and each of the Committees, followed by a question and answer session.\n\nWe were sadly unable to allow shareholders to attend our Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May 2020 given the restrict/i.rightons in place at the time in the UK. We intended to hold an in-person engagement event later in the year, however, as the pandemic continued, a physical meeting proved imposs/i.rightble. Instead, we hosted our first ever virtual retail shareholder meeting in November, where shareholders were able to hear directly from me and Bill Winters, with all Board members available to partic/i.rightpate in a virtual question and answer session. We were encouraged by the high level of partic/i.rightpation and the posit/i.rightve feedback received, and following approval of the changes to our Articles of Associat/i.righton at the 2020 AGM, we will look to enhance virtual elements of our AGMs going forward.\n\nEmployee engagement was an area of addit/i.rightonal focus during 2020, not least because of the impact of COVID-19 on employee welfare and ongoing changes in working arrangements, resulting in many colleagues working from home. The Board was keen to hear directly from employees and their experiences during these challenging times. Given travel restrict/i.rightons, we were unfortunately unable to meet colleagues in our markets, but with the adoption of various technologies we hosted virtual townhall meetings in every major region in our footprint, with every Board member partic/i.rightpating in at least one event. The response from our employees has been extremely posit/i.rightve and we will seek to build on this in the year ahead.\n\nImproved linkages between the Group and subsid/i.rightary boards was a further key area of focus for us in 2020 following our Board effectiveness reviews last year and the creation of our Greater China & North Asia hub. We held regular meetings with subsid/i.rightary board members across our footprint to ensure a strong sharing of perspectives and the re-enforcing of linkages between the Group and all its key subsid/i.rightaries. I am pleased with the progress that has been made here. You will see reference to the annual subsid/i.rightary calls for the sharing of issues and views on page 107.\n\nAs part of Board succession planning, we welcomed Phil Rivett to the Board in May following the retirement of Louis Cheung earlier in the year. In December, Phil succeeded Naguib Kheraj as Chair of the Audit Committee while Naguib succeeded David Conner as Chair of the Board Risk Committee. In September, we announced that Maria Ramos would jo/i.rightn the Board, Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee in January 2021. Our succession planning discuss/i.rightons also led us to set ambit/i.rightous aspirat/i.rightons in relation to the divers/i.rightty of our Board both in terms of ethnic/i.rightty and the wider divers/i.rightty agenda. Further details on Board and committee changes during 2020, forward succession planning and changes to our divers/i.rightty policy are provided in the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee report on pages 125 to 129. Following the recent announcement of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's appointment as Director-General of the World Trade Organisat/i.righton from 1 March 2021, Ngozi will step down from the Board on 28 February 2021. Ngozi has made valuable contribut/i.rightons to the Board during her tenure and we wish her all the best in her new role.\n\nThe year ahead will remain challenging, and we have much to deliver. The Board has started the year focusing on the impact of climate change and our progress on our sustainab/i.rightlity agenda. This is a good place to start the discuss/i.righton for the future and the need to deliver in the changed environment in which we find ourselves today.\n\nIf we execute our Corporate Plan well, leading with our purpose, we will be able to deliver not just a leaner, more profitable and strongly capital/i.rightsed bank in the coming years, but a better one. Better for our customers, our communit/i.rightes, our employees and our shareholders.\n\nI would like to close by thanking my colleagues across the Group and my fellow Board members for their commitment and contribut/i.righton over this intense and challenging period.\n\nJos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following pages provide ins/i.rightght into the content and structure of Board meetings during 2020, as well as the Board's considerat/i.righton and interact/i.righton with stakeholders.\n\nBoard meetings are an important mechanism to facil/i.righttate discuss/i.righton and action. Some of the areas detailed on the following pages formed part of the standing agenda for each meeting, while others were reviewed period/i.rightcally through the/uni00A0year.\n\nDirectors are alert to their statutory duties and obligat/i.rightons, includ/i.rightng those outlined under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (s.172), and this forms an integral part of director induct/i.righton and annual train/i.rightng.

During this challenging time, upholding effective governance remotely has been a key prior/i.rightty for the Board.\n\nThe Board has played a crucial role in steering the Group's COVID-19 response, assessing and evaluating potential actions. The Board's focus, as the pandemic continued throughout this year, has been on protecting and advancing the interests of shareholders while also ensuring the wellbeing of colleagues, supporting the Group's customers and clients, and showing solidar/i.rightty with our communit/i.rightes. Most importantly, the Board has aspired to respond to this cris/i.rights, and everything it does, with humanity. In order to assist with this aim, the Board has delegated specif/i.rightc responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to its committees and senior management team. This, combined with key stakeholder and expert opin/i.rightons where necessary, ensured effective and considered decis/i.rightonmaking during 2020.\n\nThis year the Group committed to provid/i.rightng $1 bill/i.righton in not-forprofit loans to help finance companies that supply goods and services in the battle with COVID-19.

The Board continues to engage with stakeholders virtually, both ind/i.rightvidually and as a group. All Board and committee meetings since March 2020 were adapted into virtual meetings, util/i.rightsing interact/i.rightve technology to ensure agile and robust engagement. In addit/i.righton, a number of virtual ad hoc Board meetings were held through the year to ensure key areas of discuss/i.righton were not compromised.

        "page_content": "## Our Board meetings\n\nThe Board, supported by the Group Company Secretary, recognises the importance of mainta/i.rightning a robust schedule of meetings and a rolling agenda to ensure its time is used most effectively and effic/i.rightently. Flexib/i.rightlity in the programme is key and allows speci/fi.rightc items to be added to any agenda so that the Board can focus on important matters at the appropriate time.\n\nIn response to the impact of the pandemic, the Board was quick to adapt to new ways of operating. The Board sign/i.rightficantly increased the number of ad hoc meetings it held this year, representing an increase of 60 per cent compared to 2019. The number of informal sessions and interact/i.rightons, which allow Board members to discuss areas of the business, strategy and the external environment with members of the Management Team and/or external advisers, were also notably increased during the year. The Group Chairman continued to engage privately with the Deputy Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the INEDs to assess their views and discuss matters aris/i.rightng.\n\nPerformance against delivery of the agreed key financ/i.rightal prior/i.rightties is reviewed at every meeting with particular reference to the detailed Group management accounts. The Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer comment on current trading, business performance, the market, employees, relevant stakeholders and regulatory and external developments at each meeting, and present comparative data and client ins/i.rightght. In addit/i.righton, the Group Chief Risk Officer period/i.rightcally attends meetings to update the Board on the key risks.\n\nSir Iain Lobban, who is engaged by the Board to act as an independent adviser to the Board and its committees on cyber security and cyber threat management, attended a number of Board and committee meetings to provide an independent and current view on the Group's progress in this area. The Board continue to find Sir Iain's input relevant, practical and challenging. In 2020, Sir Iain Lobban's appointment was renewed for a further 12-month term.\n\n## Our Board committees\n\nThe Board places sign/i.rightficant reliance on its committees by delegating a broad range of responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes and issues to them. It therefore remains crucial that effective linkages are in place between the committees and the Board as a whole, not least as it is impract/i.rightcable for all INEDs to be members of all of the committees. Mechanisms are in place to facil/i.righttate these linkages, includ/i.rightng ensuring that there are no gaps or unnecessary duplicat/i.rightons between the remit of each committee and overlapping membership between Board committees where necessary. Alongside interconnected committee membership, the Board receives a written summary of each of the committee's meetings and verbal updates at the Board, where appropriate.\n\nFurther details on each committee, includ/i.rightng their oversight and focus during 2020, can be found in the Board committee reports starting on page 108.\n\n## Code compliance\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) and the Hong Kong Corporate Governance Code contained in Appendix 14 of the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules (HK Code) are the standards against which we measured ourselves in 2020.\n\nThe directors are pleased to confirm that Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) continued to comply with the provis/i.rightons set out in the Code and the HK Code for the year under review other than those ident/i.rightfied below.\n\nThroughout this corporate governance report we have provided an ins/i.rightght into how governance operates with/i.rightn the Group and how we have applied the princ/i.rightples set out in the Code and HK Code.\n\nThe Group confirms that it has adopted a code of conduct regarding directors' securit/i.rightes transactions on terms no less exacting than required by Appendix 10 of the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules. Having made specif/i.rightc enquiry of all directors, the Group confirms that all directors have complied with the required standards of the adopted code of conduct.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to inadvertent oversight, the Company did not mainta/i.rightn on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Lim/i.rightted's website an updated list of its directors ident/i.rightfying their roles and functions in October and November 2020, and therefore deviated from provis/i.righton A.3.2 of the HK Code. The Company did mainta/i.rightn detail on its own website, a key aspect of the provis/i.righton, and notif/i.righted the market via regulatory announcements on the London Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange Lim/i.rightted. The deviat/i.righton was rectif/i.righted by uploading an updated list of its directors immed/i.rightately upon discover/i.rightng the oversight.\n\nCopies of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Hong Kong Corporate Governance Code can be found at frc.org.uk and hkex.com.hk respectively\n\nTo the extent applicable, informat/i.righton required by paragraphs 13(2)(c), (d), (f), (h) and (i) of Schedule 7 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 is available in Other disclosures on pages 167 to 176",

As the pandemic emerged across our markets, the Board had to adapt quickly, util/i.rightsing interact/i.rightve technology to ensure agile and robust engagement. From March, all Board and committee meetings were shifted to a virtual format.\n\nAs a truly internat/i.rightonal Board composed of directors resid/i.rightng across our markets, the move to a virtual meeting format meant that the structure of the Board agendas for the year had to be altered to take account of the multiple time zones.\n\nScheduled meetings were condensed, and a number of addit/i.rightonal ad hoc meetings and informal sessions were arranged to ensure key areas of discuss/i.righton were not compromised. This approach also provided the Board with the opportunity to gain further external perspective from a range of subjects as well as informal train/i.rightng sessions.\n\nThe Group Chairman adjusted quickly to the virtual Board meeting format, deliver/i.rightng strong leadership and ensuring, alongside the rest of the Board, effective, robust and collaborative discuss/i.righton during Board meetings and sessions.\n\nThe diagram on this page shows the Board's collective engagement during the year.\n\n## Board activ/i.rightties during 2020\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Director induct/i.righton\n\nOne new director, Phil Rivett, was appointed to the Board during 2020. Phil possesses highly relevant skills and a breadth of knowledge relevant to the Board debate. Phil has sign/i.rightficant professional accountancy and audit experience, specif/i.rightcally focused in the financ/i.rightal services sector. He has a strong technical understanding and broad financ/i.rightal and business experience.\n\nPrior to being appointed to the Board and subsequently Audit Committee Chair, Phil was given a number of induct/i.righton sessions to ensure a smooth transit/i.righton into taking up his roles. He shadowed the exist/i.rightng Audit Committee Chair during the Company's half year and third quarter results processes, as well as meeting the outgoing and incom/i.rightng statutory auditor lead partners.\n\nOn jo/i.rightning the Board, Phil undertook a wide-ranging and robust induct/i.righton programme to ensure that he was well placed to make a posit/i.rightve contribut/i.righton from the outset. While this was adapted into a virtual format in light of travel restrict/i.rightons across our markets, this was no less comprehensive. Whilst a proportion of the induct/i.righton is relevant to all new Board members, the content of the programme is tailored to meet each director's ind/i.rightvidual level of experience and expertise. In the case of Phil, a key element of the programme was ensuring he developed a detailed understanding of the Group's strategy and the complexit/i.rightes of operating through client segments, product groups and regional businesses.\n\nMaria Ramos jo/i.rightned the Board on 1 January 2021. Maria brings a wealth of CEO, banking, commercial, financ/i.rightal, policy and internat/i.rightonal experience to the Board. Maria also brings considerable non-executive experience, having served on internat/i.rightonal boards. Good progress has been made regarding Maria's induct/i.righton plan so far this year.\n\nThe Group Corporate Secretariat is resourced to support the INEDs as they undertake their induct/i.righton programmes. They are typically completed with/i.rightn the first six to nine months of an INED appointment.\n\n## Ongoing development plans\n\nTrain/i.rightng and development of our directors is ongoing and does not end following their induct/i.righton. Continuous development of our Board directors is crucial to mainta/i.rightning a highly engaged, well-informed and effective Board. Mandatory learning and train/i.rightng are key elements of directors' fit and proper assessments as mandated under the Senior Managers Regime. During the year, all directors received a combinat/i.righton of mandatory learning and train/i.rightng, internal and external brief/i.rightngs, presentations from guest speakers and papers on a range of topics to ensure the directors are well-informed and that the Board remains highly effective. The Board committee members also received specif/i.rightc train/i.rightng relevant to the work of their committee. The Group Chairman reviews with each director their train/i.rightng and development needs both in real time and as part of the annual performance cycle. Where it is recognised that the Board or ind/i.rightvidual directors need further train/i.rightng or development in key areas, addit/i.rightonal sessions are arranged with subject matter experts.\n\nThe directors' ongoing train/i.rightng in 2020 took the form of formal refresher sessions and informal meetings, covering a variety of topics throughout the year, the major/i.rightty held virtually in light of the pandemic. The table below gives further detail on who received these brief/i.rightngs.\n\nAll of the directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary, who provides support to the Board and is responsible for advis/i.rightng the Board on governance matters. Directors also have access to independent professional advice at the Group's expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes as directors.\n\n## 2020 Director

        "page_content": "## Board effectiveness\n\nFollowing the thorough evaluation of the Board by Independent Board Evaluation at the end of last year in parallel to the review carried out by the PRA, this year's Board and committees' effectiveness review was conducted internally, facil/i.righttated by the Group Company Secretary, and in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Progress against the 2020 Action Plan\n\nThe 2020 Action Plan set out a number of actions to be achieved following the external effectiveness reviews conducted by Independent Board Evaluation and the PRA in 2019. The 2020 Action Plan was regularly reviewed during the year and good progress had been made against many of the actions as evidenced by this year's internal Board effectiveness review. While the ambit/i.righton of the plan meant that it was a 12-18 month programme, lim/i.righttations to travel during the year has impacted on the delivery of some specif/i.rightc actions which have been carried forward to 2021.\n\n## 2020 Board effectiveness review\n\nQuestionna/i.rightres were sent to each director for completion, seeking to draw out and explore some of the themes highl/i.rightghted in last year's review as well as pose some wideranging and probing questions. The results were compiled into a detailed report and conclusions were discussed with the Group Chairman and by the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee ahead of a Board discuss/i.righton. Here, the key find/i.rightngs and recommendations were presented along with an action plan for 2021, which was approved by the Board. Details of the key observations from this year's review and the agreed Action Plan are set out on this page.\n\nThe Board's six committees were also included as part of the effectiveness review. The observations and key themes were shared with the relevant committee Chairs before discuss/i.righton by each of the committees and action plans for 2021 approved. Details of the key observations and action plans for each of the committees can be found with/i.rightn each of the committees' reports.\n\n## Key observations from the 2020 internal effectiveness review\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has made good progress in meeting its prior/i.rightties against a diff/i.rightcult backdrop which prevented in-person engagement between the Board or with stakeholders across our markets\n- \u00b7 Posit/i.rightve progress was made against the KPIs and on the quality of Board papers and management informat/i.righton. Directors were encouraged to continue giv/i.rightng feedback in this area\n- \u00b7 Suggestions and recommendations made to further drive effic/i.rightencies in the operation of the Board committees\n- \u00b7 Improvements were made to the linkages with subsid/i.rightary boards and committees through active engagement\n- \u00b7 Further scope for Board train/i.rightng in respect to informat/i.righton cyber security and technology\n\n## 2021 Action Plan\n\n- \u00b7 Review effic/i.rightency of Board and committee structures. Review allocation of current committee matters across the Board and its committees\n- \u00b7 Continue to drive employee engagement with more events (virtually, if necessary), includ/i.rightng more informal virtual sessions with colleagues and country teams\n- \u00b7 Arrange for Board members to meet country management teams (virtually, if necessary) to extend understanding and relationsh/i.rightps\n- \u00b7 Continue focus on technology, IT and SC Ventures and establish a programme to expose the Board to both the challenges and the opportunit/i.rightes for the Group in this area\n\n## Internal evaluation process\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Group Chairman's performance\n\nThe Senior Independent Director, Christ/i.rightne Hodgson, led the process of review/i.rightng the Group Chairman's performance. She met and spoke with the INEDs separately, without the Group Chairman present, to evaluate his performance, taking into account the views of the executive directors. The feedback was collated, and consolidated feedback was shared with Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als.\n\n## Directors' performance\n\nEvaluation of ind/i.rightvidual director performance was carried out by the Group Chairman in 2020. These one-to-one discuss/i.rightons provided an opportunity for each of the INEDs, to discuss with Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 Their performance against the core competencies and their ind/i.rightvidual effectiveness\n- \u00b7 Their time commitment to the Group, includ/i.rightng (where relevant) the potential impact of any outside interests\n- \u00b7 Their ongoing development\n- \u00b7 The Board's composit/i.righton, taking into account when each INED envisaged stepping down from the Board\n- \u00b7 The current and future committee membership and structure\n\nThese performance reviews are used as the basis for recommending the re-election of directors by shareholders at the 2021 AGM and to assist the Group Chairman with his assessment of the INEDs' competencies. In addit/i.righton, the Group Chairman has responsib/i.rightlity for assessing on an annual basis, the fitness and propriety of the Company's INEDs and the Group Chief Executive Officer under the Senior Managers Regime. These assessments were carried out in respect of each INED and the Group Chief Executive at the end of 2020.\n\n## Director independence\n\nIn determin/i.rightng the independence of a non-executive director, the Board considers each ind/i.rightvidual against the criter/i.righta set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules and also considers their contribut/i.righton and conduct at Board meetings, includ/i.rightng how they demonstrate object/i.rightve judgement and independent think/i.rightng.\n\nThe Board considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent of Standard Chartered and has concluded that there are no relationsh/i.rightps or circumstances likely to impa/i.rightr any INED's judgement.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOur INEDs commit suffic/i.rightent time in discharg/i.rightng their responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes as directors of Standard Chartered. In general, we estimate that each INED spent approximately 35 to 70 days on Board-related duties, and considerably more for those who chair or are members of multiple committees.\n\n## External directorsh/i.rightps and other business interests\n\nBoard members hold external directorsh/i.rightps and other outside business interests. We recognise the sign/i.rightficant benefits that greater boardroom exposure provides for our directors. However, we closely monitor the nature and number of external directorsh/i.rightps our directors hold, in order to satisfy ourselves that any addit/i.rightonal appointments will not adversely impact their time commitment to their role at Standard Chartered, and to ensure that all of our Board members remain compliant with the PRA directorsh/i.rightp requirements, as well as the shareholder advisory groups' ind/i.rightvidual guidance on 'over-boarding'. These requirements impose a lim/i.rightt on the number of directorsh/i.rightps both executive and independent nonexecutive directors are permitted to hold.\n\nDetails of the directors' external directorsh/i.rightps can be found in their biograph/i.rightes on pages 83 to 86. Before committ/i.rightng to an addit/i.rightonal appointment, directors confirm the existence of any potential or actual conflicts, that the role will not breach their lim/i.rightt as set out by the PRA, and provide the necessary assurance that the appointment will not adversely impact their abil/i.rightty to continue to fulfil their role as a director of the Company.\n\nOur established internal processes ensure that directors do not undertake any new external appointments without first receiv/i.rightng formal approval of the Board. The Board has delegated authority to make such approvals to the Group Chairman, with the exception of his own appointments. Of those INEDs who took on new external directorsh/i.rightps during the year, two were regarded as sign/i.rightficant directorsh/i.rightps (appointed to the board of a listed company) and as such were announced to the market in line with our list/i.rightng obligat/i.rightons. Further detail on the specif/i.rightc appointments are provided below:\n\n- \u00b7 Gay Huey Evans was appointed an INED of IHS Markit on 21 August 2020 and Jasmine Whitbread will be appointed Chair of Travis Perkins plc on 31 March 2021. Gay and Jasmine ind/i.rightvidually discussed their respective appointments with the Group Chairman in advance of accepting the posit/i.rightons and each provided assurance that their appointments would not impact their abil/i.rightties to devote suffic/i.rightent time and focus to both their Board and committee responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n- \u00b7 Gay and Jasmine continue to hold no more than the maximum number of INED directorsh/i.rightps permitted under the PRA rules. Gay stepped down from the board of Itau BBA International Plc on 21 August 2020 and Jasmine will step down as chief executive of London First on 31 March 2021, ensuring that both directors are able to continue to devote suffic/i.rightent time to Standard Chartered\n\nThe Board's executive directors are permitted to hold only one non-executive directorsh/i.rightp. Of our executive directors, Andy Halford is the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Audit Committee at Marks and Spencer Group plc, listed on the FTSE 250, and Bill Winters is a non-executive director of Novartis International AG, listed on SIX Swiss Exchange.",

A key enabler of stakeholder engagement in recent years has been Board and/or director vis/i.rightts to the Group's markets. Mandatory restrict/i.rightons and social distanc/i.rightng measures brought in across our markets at different times, to lim/i.rightt the spread of COVID-19 across the Group's footprint, prevented most tradit/i.rightonal approaches to engagement this year. As with Board meetings, engagement with stakeholders during 2020 were adapted and became virtual experiences. While util/i.rightsing interact/i.rightve technology ensured effective and effic/i.rightent dialogue in some areas it did prevent the breadth of engagement which the Board would usually undertake.\n\nEngagement with our stakeholders, regardless of whether in physical or virtual form, continues to enhance the Board's understanding of how the Group is operating across our diverse markets, how the strategy is landing, as well as the changing nature of the business and the sector.\n\nIn addit/i.righton to collective Board engagement with stakeholders, our INEDs and the external adviser members to the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee engaged directly with a wide range of management and stakeholders during the year. Informal and formal sessions with ind/i.rightviduals and groups across our footprint provide INEDs and external adviser members with a deeper understanding of the business and the market environment with/i.rightn which the Group operates.\n\nFurther detail regarding the Board's engagement with our stakeholders can be found on the following pages.\n\n- \u00b7 Testing the execution of the Group's strategic prior/i.rightties\n- \u00b7 Enhanced understanding of the changing nature of the business and its wider market\n- \u00b7 A mechanism for better informed decis/i.righton-making\n- \u00b7 More effective risk management\n- \u00b7 Promoting a shared vis/i.righton and purpose among key stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Sharing of experience, knowledge and expertise across different groups\n- \u00b7 Helping ident/i.rightfy strategies to promote competit/i.rightve strength",

In addit/i.righton, Christ/i.rightne Hodgson, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, continued to discuss with and collect feedback from shareholders on a range of remuneration matters.\n\nBill Winters and Andy Halford are the primary spokespeople for the Group. Throughout the year they engaged extensively with exist/i.rightng shareholders and potential new investors during ind/i.rightvidual or group virtual meetings and conferences. In addit/i.righton, each member of the Management Team responsible for a client segment or a geographic region, as well as the Group Treasurer, virtually met with investors to promote greater awareness and understanding of the strategy in their respective areas, as well as taking the opportunity to receive investor feedback first hand.\n\n## Engaging with investors: what we did during 2020\n\n## Institut/i.rightonal shareholders\n\nThe Group mainta/i.rightns a diverse, high-quality and predominantly inst/i.righttutional shareholder base.

Given the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, includ/i.rightng restrict/i.rightons put in place by the UK Government regarding the maximum number of attendees at meetings at the time, the Company's AGM on 6 May 2020 was held as a procedural meeting to meet its statutory obligat/i.rightons. Shareholders were asked not to attend but instead to vote in advance and submit any questions by email. All the proposed resolutions were passed, with shareholder support for each ranging from 95.50 per cent to 99.99 per cent. Resolution 2, to declare a final div/i.rightdend of $0.20 per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2019, was withdrawn by the Board in response to a request from the PRA and as a consequence of the unprecedented challenges facing the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Virtual Retail Shareholder Event\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the time of this year's AGM, it was announced that Standard Chartered PLC would aim to hold a dedicated retail shareholder event with the Board later in the year. As restrict/i.rightons in the UK continued, the Board decided to host a virtual event instead. The event, which took place on 23 November 2020, gave shareholders the opportunity to hear directly from the Board on a range of issues, includ/i.rightng performance against the Group's refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties, the impact of COVID-19 across its markets and the in/i.righttiat/i.rightves the Group had put in place to support our clients, colleagues and communit/i.rightes.\n\nThe event was held via teleconference, with the Q&A session facil/i.righttated through a web-based platform. The platform enabled shareholders to view the questions that others had asked, and vote on those questions they viewed as most important for the Board to address during the event. The questions asked covered a variety of topics, includ/i.rightng sustainable growth, shareholder value, the withdrawal of the 2019 final div/i.rightdend and the impact of geopolit/i.rightcal developments.\n\nShareholder uptake for the event was high and the Board received posit/i.rightve feedback regarding the electronic format.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe results of the voting at the 2020 AGM can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\n## Engagement with clients and suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClients are central to everything we do in the Group and the Board recognises the importance of promoting robust relationsh/i.rightps with them. In previous years, a large proportion of key customer engagements were built into Board and director vis/i.rightts to the Group's markets. Lim/i.righttations on internat/i.rightonal travel meant that our usual approach could not be carried out during 2020. Members of the Board adapted rapidly to the pandemic, holding a number of calls with clients as well as receiv/i.rightng updates from senior management on the wider Group's interact/i.righton. In addit/i.righton, members of the Board virtually engaged with suppliers during the year.\n\n## Engagement with regulators and governments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs an internat/i.rightonal banking Group, the Board regularly engages with relevant authorit/i.rightes across our footprint. Uncertainty caused by the pandemic and evolving geopolit/i.rightcal events has only served to reinforce the importance of supporting the effective function/i.rightng of the financ/i.rightal system and economic environment. As with most forms of stakeholder engagement during 2020, physical meetings were modif/i.righted to virtual interact/i.rightons and calls as the year progressed. The Board engaged with regulators and governments via a number of forums, either collectively or ind/i.rightvidually.\n\n## Engagement with society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board receives regular updates from management concerning the communit/i.rightes and environment in which we operate. During the outbreak of the pandemic, updates were presented to the Board on a fortnightly basis to monitor the evolving impact across our footprint. As part of this process, the Board endorsed the in/i.righttiat/i.rightves, approach and leadership management had taken in launching the $50 mill/i.righton global fund to provide assistance to those affected by COVID-19.\n\nDue to travel restrict/i.rightons in place through 2020, the Board was unable to physically vis/i.rightt many of the Group's markets. As such, external and internal speakers provided input to the Board's discuss/i.righton throughout the year, which covered some key societal issues around the evolving geopolit/i.rightcal landscape, the longer-term impact of the pandemic and the future of global trade.",

The primary reason for taking a different approach was that as a global organisat/i.righton with more than 83,000 employees across 59 diverse markets, it is vital that any Board engagement should gather unfiltered feedback which is representative of the whole workforce in order to be truly effective.\n\n## Board engagement with employees\n\n## Greater China & North Asia\n\nNovember 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA more formalised framework was put in place to supplement the channels which already exist, for the Board to understand the views of the workforce, which includes: the annual My Voice survey; the confident/i.rightal Speak Up process; informat/i.righton reported from senior management on culture; disc/i.rightplinar/i.rightes and grievances data and themes; and direct engagement the Board has with employees as it engages with its markets, collectively and ind/i.rightvidually. The key themes and action plans were reported to, and discussed by, the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee before being reported to the Board.\n\nLast year, we experimented with the introduct/i.righton of an addit/i.rightonal method of direct engagement and two-way dialogue between the Board and our employees, consist/i.rightng of two interact/i.rightve engagement sessions, held between employees and the Board. Build/i.rightng on the posit/i.rightve feedback from employees who partic/i.rightpated and constrained by restrict/i.rightons on travel, the Board enhanced its engagement this year by hosting four events, each dedicated to a particular region of the Group's footprint at the time. These included Europe & Americas, Greater China & North Asia, ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & the Middle East. The events were facil/i.righttated through a teleconference, with a live Q&A session accessed via a web-based platform.\n\nEmployee feedback from all four engagements sessions was posit/i.rightve, with employees appreciat/i.rightng the interact/i.rightve Q&A element that allowed them to vote on popular questions.\n\n## Europe & Americas\n\nJuly 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group Chairman hosted each of the employee engagement sessions and was jo/i.rightned by a combinat/i.righton of all INEDs over the four events.

As with the major/i.rightty of stakeholder engagement during 2020, the Board's abil/i.rightty to physically meet with people from across the Group's footprint was lim/i.rightted. Despite this, the Group Chairman and INEDs engaged with the Group's subsid/i.rightaries through a number of forums. This included chair and committee chair engagement sessions, as well as other forms of interact/i.righton.\n\nFollowing the Board's global subsid/i.rightary governance conference last year, the Group Chairman hosted three subsid/i.rightary chair engagement sessions during 2020. Each event opened with remarks from the Group Chairman, followed by a Q&A session. All three sessions were held virtually, with the Group Chairman encouraged by the high level of interact/i.righton. Items discussed across the three sessions included:\n\n- \u00b7 Group performance\n- \u00b7 Impact of COVID-19 across the Group's markets\n- \u00b7 Geopolit/i.rightcal developments\n- \u00b7 Sustainab/i.rightlity\n- \u00b7 Areas of focus for the Group's boards\n- \u00b7 Board effectiveness\n\nThe Audit Committee held its annual conference call during the year, which was hosted by the Audit Committee Chair and attended by the chairs of subsid/i.rightary audit committees. The Group Head, Finance, Group Head of Internal Audit, Group Head, Corporate Affairs, Brand & Marketing, Conduct, Financ/i.rightal Crime and Compliance, lead audit partner of the Group's outgoing statutory auditor at the time, KPMG, lead audit partner of the Group's incom/i.rightng statutory auditor at the time, EY, and the Group Company Secretary also partic/i.rightpated in the call.

The Group Chairman, a member of the Remuneration Committee, the Global Head, Performance, Reward & Employee Relations, Head, Executive Compensation and Reward Governance, regional heads of Performance, Reward & Benefits and the Group Company Secretary also partic/i.rightpated in the call. Partic/i.rightpants noted the importance for remuneration committees to be connected across the organisat/i.righton and to foster knowledge-sharing as the focus on remuneration governance increases. Items covered during the call included:\n\n- \u00b7 2020 Remuneration Committee focus areas includ/i.rightng monitor/i.rightng the short and long-term impact of the pandemic on remuneration\n- \u00b7 Implementation of required changes under new legislat/i.righton and regulation\n- \u00b7 2020 to 2021 Performance, Reward and Benefits prior/i.rightties\n\nAll Board Committee Chairs who hosted audio and/or video conference calls welcomed feedback and suggestions on how improvements could be made to the format for future sessions. The engagement calls were well received by its partic/i.rightpants, with particular praise for the live Q&A element that was built into the agenda for each session.\n\nFormal reporting mechanisms to improve linkages between Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Lim/i.rightted (SCB Hong Kong), Standard Chartered Bank and Standard Chartered PLC were enhanced during the year.

The Board is satisf/i.righted that Phil Rivett has recent and relevant financ/i.rightal experience and that the other Committee members also have a depth of experience having managed complex balance sheets or having knowledge of financ/i.rightal reporting in internat/i.rightonal business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiograph/i.rightcal details of the committee members can be viewed on pages 83 to 86\n\n## Main responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the Committee\n\nThe Committee is responsible for oversight and advice to the Board on matters relating to financ/i.rightal reporting. The Committee's role is to review, on behalf of the Board, the Group's internal controls and internal financ/i.rightal controls. The Committee has exercised oversight of the work undertaken by Conduct, Financ/i.rightal Crime and Compliance (CFCC), Group Internal Audit (GIA) and the Group's Statutory Auditor, EY. The Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nAs the new Chair of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present the Audit Committee's report for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nIn addit/i.righton to the disclosure requirements relating to audit committees under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, the following report sets out the areas of sign/i.rightficant focus for the Committee and its activ/i.rightties over the course of the year. The report also covers the review undertaken on the effectiveness of the Group's Statutory Auditor, EY and ongoing oversight of the effectiveness of the GIA function. Assurance has been sought and received by the Committee concerning the resourcing of Group Finance, GIA and CFCC.\n\nSince April 2019, meetings have taken place as dual Audit Committee meetings of Standard Chartered PLC and Standard Chartered Bank, under the governance structure put in place to reflect the Group's corporate entity restructuring. I jo/i.rightned the Audit Committee on 6 May and became Chair on 1 December 2020. I had an ample period of time shadowing Naguib Kheraj, the outgoing Committee Chair, which provided crit/i.rightcal ins/i.rightght into the ways of working for this role. I would like to thank Naguib for the time he dedicated to this and the comprehensive handover I received. I am delighted that Naguib remains a member of the Audit Committee. I would also like to welcome Maria Ramos, who jo/i.rightned the Committee on 1 January 2021.\n\nUnsurpris/i.rightngly, the impacts of COVID-19 have been a sign/i.rightficant focus for the Committee this year. In particular, time has been spent review/i.rightng credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons, key accounting issues and sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements made by management to ensure appropriateness and that the Group's public disclosures are transparent with regard to the impacts of COVID-19. In particular, focus has been placed on the judgements and management overlays relating to IFRS 9, which is a technically complex area. Attention was placed on the Monte Carlo model and observations made that the macroeconomic variables used by this model can be narrow. In response to challenge from the Committee, management provided assurance that the parameters used for this model were being updated in order to generate a wider set of scenarios. Sign/i.rightficant time and focus has also been placed on the judgements involved in aviat/i.righton and shipp/i.rightng, given the turbulent external environment.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19, GIA took a revised approach to the Group's audits. GIA focused on provid/i.rightng timely, nimble and independent assurance over the Group's approach to managing COVID-19. This revised approach was based on the princ/i.rightple that GIA should protect the Group and its assets, while min/i.rightmis/i.rightng disrupt/i.righton to the first and second lines of defence. Throughout the year, the Committee continued to probe that the Group's internal controls infrastructure was not being adversely impacted by working from home (WFH) arrangements, as a result of lockdowns across the Group's network. The Committee was able to seek and receive assurance that the Group's response to and operations during COVID-19 remained appropriate for our shareholders, customers and colleagues.\n\n2020 has been EY's first year as the Group's Statutory Auditor, and notably it has been a challenging environment to perform audit work, given the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns across the Group's network. I am pleased to report that EY has brought both fresh perspective and independent challenge this year, which is benefic/i.rightal for management. A number of subject matter experts from EY have presented to the Committee over the course of the year on areas such as Aviat/i.righton Finance, the UK Audit Reform and Regional/Country overviews on key markets in which the Group operates. This is a practice that we will encourage for 2021 and beyond.\n\nThe Committee has exercised its authority delegated by the Board for ensuring the integr/i.rightty of the Group's published financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton by discuss/i.rightng and challenging the judgements and disclosures made by management, and the assumptions and estimates on which they are based. The Committee has exercised judgement in decid/i.rightng which of the issues it considered to be sign/i.rightficant in the financ/i.rightal statements, and this report sets out the material matters that it has considered in these deliberat/i.rightons. Management reporting to the Committee from across the business has provided the opportunity for the Committee to challenge, probe, discuss and seek assurance from management, enabling the Committee to provide an independent perspective.\n\nAs a result of the Committee's work in 2020, assurance has been provided to the Board on the quality and appropriateness of the Group's financ/i.rightal reporting, in particular taking account of COVID-19 impacts, and on internal audit, compliance and regulatory matters, to continue to safeguard the interests of the Group's broader stakeholders.

In particular,  the Committee challenged management's assessments and the detailed  sensit/i.rightvity analysis to ensure that the impl/i.rightcations of COVID-19 had been fully  considered, as the aircraft industry was particularly affected by COVID-19 and  lockdowns. The Committee reviewed detailed sensit/i.rightvity analysis on the factors  that would impact the ViU assessments includ/i.rightng residual values, remarketing  periods after lease terminat/i.rightons, reductions in market rental rates and   discount rates while assessing the impa/i.rightrment calculations for the aircraft.   The Committee also focused its review on lease payment deferrals granted   to lessees as a result of COVID-19 to assess any potential impact on the ViU  assessments for the related aircraft and monitored progress on repayments |\n| Goodwill                           | Reviewed management's annual assessment of impa/i.rightrment covering key  key assumptions.

GIA focused on provid/i.rightng timely, nimble and independent assurance over the Group's approach to managing COVID-19. There were shorter, sharper focused pieces of work on emerging risks, which provided the Committee with assurance that the Group's response to and operations during COVID-19 remained appropriate for our shareholders, customers and colleagues and aligned to our Here for good brand promise. The Committee sought and received assurance from management that this revised approach was adding value to the business and continued to focus on the effectiveness of controls and processes. The Committee also monitored, on an ongoing basis, that travel restrict/i.rightons and WFH arrangements were not impact/i.rightng the quality or integr/i.rightty of audit work or the internal controls infrastructure of the Group.\n\nIn 2019, an external assessor, Grant Thornton (selected by the Committee from a competit/i.rightve request for proposal process), conducted an external quality assurance review on the GIA function, which assessed the requirements of GIA against key professional and regulatory bodies governing the practice of internal audit. While it was recognised that GIA 'generally conforms' to the requirements of these standards, some recommendations were made. During the course of 2020, the Committee received updates on progress against these recommendations.\n\nIn 2020, for the most sign/i.rightficant matters being monitored by GIA, business and/or regional management were inv/i.rightted to attend meetings to provide updates on the steps being taken to enhance the control environment and address internal audit find/i.rightngs.\n\nThe Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the adequacy of resourcing and proposed work plans for GIA and is satisf/i.righted that these are appropriate in light of proposed areas of focus, expertise and skills that are required\n- \u00b7 Assessed the role and effectiveness of the GIA function, and reviewed and monitored GIA's progress against its annual audit plan and the review and monitor/i.rightng of post-audit actions.

It reviews the Group's Risk Appetite Statement and makes recommendations to the Board.

The Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following\n\neach Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the new Chair of the Board Risk Committee, I am pleased to present the Board Risk Committee's report for the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nSince April 2019, meetings have taken place as dual Risk Committee meetings of Standard Chartered PLC and Standard Chartered Bank, under the governance structure put in place to reflect the Group's corporate entity restructuring. I became Chair of the Board Risk Committee on 1 December 2020, having been a member for a number of years. I would like to thank David Conner for the comprehensive handover I received and am delighted that David remains on the Committee as a member. I would like to welcome the newer members to the Committee: Phil Rivett who jo/i.rightned on 6 May 2020, David Tang who jo/i.rightned on 1 October 2020 and Maria Ramos who jo/i.rightned on 1/uni00A0January 2021.\n\nThroughout the year, focus has been placed on the impact of COVID-19 and how the Group has responded to and managed the related risks. On a regular basis, the Committee received and discussed a paper on COVID-19 risks, which provided an assessment of the Group's response to COVID-19. The incorporation of COVID-19 into the Group's stress scenarios and portfolio reviews of the exposures most at risk in the economic downturn has enabled management to ident/i.rightfy potential areas of vulnerabil/i.rightty and manage these appropriately. The Committee spent time review/i.rightng vulnerable sectors and consumer credit portfolio performance. We monitored to ensure that appropriate action was taken as credit condit/i.rightons deteriorated. Furthermore, attention was placed on interest rate risk, and the impact of market volatil/i.rightty on the Financ/i.rightal Markets business and the Capital Management portfolio. Outside of Committee meetings, David Conner had regular calls with the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) to ensure that he was kept informed of emerging developments as they occurred, and in turn, this enabled Committee members to be notif/i.righted of any sign/i.rightficant matters in real-time. This communicat/i.righton mechanism was important as COVID-19 evolved.\n\nICS Risk remained a key prior/i.rightty this year, with reporting from management in the first, second and third lines of defence, to enable the Committee to understand the progress being made and areas of improvement being worked on. This remains a prior/i.rightty for 2021.\n\nOperational resil/i.rightence became a sign/i.rightficant focus for the Committee as COVID-19 unfolded and various lockdowns across the Group's network came into effect. Operational and ICS risks, resulting from colleagues working from home (WFH) were carefully monitored, to ensure that these risks were not increas/i.rightng or manifest/i.rightng themselves in different ways. The Committee continued to place focus on the risks associated with the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transit/i.righton, Model Risk management and Operational Risk, through dedicated papers and regular reporting such as the GCRO's reports and GIA reports.\n\nWe held a 'blue sky think/i.rightng/horizon scanning' discuss/i.righton, which covered the potential risks that the Group might be or could become exposed to. Recognis/i.rightng the importance of being able to step back and consider emerging risks, a dedicated 'blue sky think/i.rightng/horizon scanning' session has been scheduled for 2021, and will be an annual agenda item going forward.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee held two informal sessions covering COVID-19 stress test and recovery capacity and SC Ventures governance. These sessions were opened up to all Board members and provided dedicated time and space to dive deeper into these topics.\n\nClimate Risk remains a key prior/i.rightty for the Group and the Committee has monitored the progress being made against our Climate Risk workplan, and the speed of execution in integrat/i.rightng Climate Risk into mainstream risk processes. Needless to say, this will be a continued prior/i.rightty for 2021, not least given the Bank of England's climate-related stress test this coming year.\n\nThe Committee applied scrutiny to the risks related to US-China tensions and US elections. In antic/i.rightpation of market disrupt/i.righton ahead of Brexit and ongoing US-China tensions, the Committee reviewed and approved liqu/i.rightdity lim/i.rightts for the Group. Given the ever-changing external environment, the Committee continues to discuss key macroeconomic and geopolit/i.rightcal risks and challenges faced by the Group, and probe how these are being managed and mit/i.rightgated by management.\n\nThe following pages provide ins/i.rightght and context into the Committee's work and activ/i.rightties during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Naguib Kheraj\n\nChair of the Board Risk Committee",

The Group's Liqu/i.rightdity Coverage Ratio was proposed to be increased to 130 per cent\n- \u00b7 Operational Risk: Changes were proposed covering new and amended metrics. Exist/i.rightng metrics were challenged to reflect a more forward-looking view of the risks and ensure that new risks and elevated residual risks are suffic/i.rightently emphasised\n- \u00b7 ICS Risk: ICS Risk Appetite metrics were developed to measure the Group's security and resil/i.rightence to ICS events and inc/i.rightdents which could impact its most crit/i.rightcal systems and assets. A comprehensive and in-depth review of the histor/i.rightc ICS metrics was undertaken, looking at whether they are fit for purpose, to ensure that proposed metrics drive change and align to the key risk elements of the Group's ICS strategy\n- \u00b7 Climate Risk: Recognised as a material cross-cutting risk for the Group. A number of Climate Risk metrics are being developed for introduct/i.righton in 2022\n- \u00b7 Credit Risk: A number of changes were made with regard to defin/i.righttions and thresholds\n- \u00b7 Traded Risk: Thresholds for a number of metrics were amended to reflect a change in methodology\n- \u00b7 Reputational Risk and Compliance Risk: Changes largely related to the tighten/i.rightng of defin/i.righttions and an increase in the reporting frequency of Compliance metrics from quarterly to monthly\n- \u00b7 Operational Risk: Changes were proposed covering new and amended metrics.

In addit/i.righton, the Committee had deeper discuss/i.rightons on the topics set out below.\n\nIn 2020, some changes were made to the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types, in order to reflect the changing risk dynamics and ensure appropriate focus. Accordingly, the defin/i.righttions of Operational and Reputational Risk were expanded to include Technology and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk, respectively. Addit/i.rightonally, recognis/i.rightng the importance of Conduct Risk across the wider organisat/i.righton, this will be managed through the overall ERMF, so that it becomes embedded in all Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types.

This report provides an overview of the Group's risk profile against the Group's Risk Appetite Statement. The GCRO's report covers the macroeconomic environment, geopolit/i.rightcal outlook, material disclosures and ongoing risks. Coverage of Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types and regulatory matters are also included in this report. By way of example, regular updates on the US elections, Brexit and US-China tensions have been reported on and discussed throughout the/uni00A0year.\n\nThe Committee has the authority to request and receive relevant informat/i.righton consistent with the requirements of BCBS 239 that will allow the Committee to fulfil its governance mandate relating to risks to which the Group is exposed, and alert senior management when risk reports do not meet its requirements.\n\n## Risk management disclosures\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the risk disclosures in the Annual Report and the Half Year Report, and has also reviewed the disclosures regarding the work of the Committee.\n\n## Interaction with the Group Chief Risk Officer\n\nThe Committee Chair meets ind/i.rightvidually with the GCRO regularly between formal Committee meetings. These meetings allow open discuss/i.righton of any matters relating to issues aris/i.rightng from the Committee's formal discuss/i.rightons and inform the forward-looking agenda.\n\n## Interaction with management\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the need to hold management directly accountable when issues have arisen and have been reported by the GCRO. Senior management has attended Committee meetings for deeper discuss/i.rightons in such instances. The Committee Chair also meets ind/i.rightvidually with senior leaders of the Risk function.\n\n## 2021 Action Plan\n\nThe 2021 Action Plan for the Committee reflects suggestions from the evaluation and continues to build on the solid progress made last year:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure effective handover to the new Chair\n- \u00b7 Consider ways to enhance discuss/i.rightons on ICS-related matters, operational resil/i.rightence and technology obsolescence\n- \u00b7 As with all Committees, keep under review the quality and length of papers and ensure they draw out the key issues to help focus the Committee's discuss/i.righton effectively\n- \u00b7 Schedule train/i.rightng sessions to include Treasury risks, technology and models\n\n## Interaction with regulators\n\nThe Committee Chair meets period/i.rightcally with the Group's UK lead regulators, the PRA, as well as the FCA.\n\nTypically, the Committee meets with the PRA on an annual basis, without members of management being present. In 2020, this meeting was postponed due to COVID-19. The purpose of these meetings is to enable a discuss/i.righton between the Committee and the PRA concerning prudentialfocused topics.\n\n## Interaction between Board committees on risk-related issues\n\nIn the few instances where it does not have primary oversight for a given type of risk, the Committee interacts closely with other Board Committees where the remit of these other Committees clearly covers risk-related matters. For example, the Audit Committee has oversight of the Group's internal financ/i.rightal controls and regulatory compliance; the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee has oversight of the responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes in relation to financ/i.rightal crime compliancerelated matters; and the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee has oversight of the mechanisms by which Reputational Risk is managed. The interact/i.righton assists the Committee in ensuring that it is well informed on discuss/i.rightons held, and the close collaboration of the Committee Chairs helps to ensure that there are no gaps and any potential for unnecessary duplicat/i.righton is avoided.\n\n## Risk function resourcing\n\nThe Committee has sought and received assurance that the Risk function is adequately resourced to perform its function effectively. The Committee's discuss/i.rightons included an overview of the changes to the Risk function in 2020; and management's forward-looking view of the Risk function.\n\n## Linkages with subsid/i.rightary board risk committees\n\nIn conjunct/i.righton with the Chair of the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, David Conner (the outgoing Committee Chair) co-hosted an annual call with the chairs of subsid/i.rightary board risk committees in July 2020. David Conner also attended a board risk committee of Standard Chartered Bank Niger/i.righta Lim/i.rightted as an observer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of this call can be found on page 107",

The Committee provided guidance and challenge to ensure new polic/i.rightes and practices remained consistent with the Group's values and supported long-term sustainable success. Plans for investment in employee wellbeing in/i.righttiat/i.rightves were accelerated and the Committee endorsed the launch of the Group's Standard for Tackling Domestic Violence and Abuse to support the wellbeing of colleagues following global reports of an increase of domestic violence as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic the Committee monitored progress on delivery of the $50m COVID-19 Charitable Fund and the launch of the $1bn financ/i.rightng at cost for COVID-19 mit/i.rightgation across qualify/i.rightng Global and Commercial Banking clients.\n\nGiven the particularly challenging circumstances faced by all in 2020, mainta/i.rightning two-way dialogue with the workforce remained a high prior/i.rightty for the Board and enhancements to the workforce engagement framework continued at pace. The 2020 workforce engagement plans were updated in response to travel restrict/i.rightons and four regional calls were hosted by Board members. The agenda for each call comprised relevant themes for each region in order to support meaningful dialogue. The Committee noted the posit/i.rightve feedback received from employees on the engagement sessions and continues to discuss how to make these sessions more interact/i.rightve and to increase employee partic/i.rightpation further. During the year, the Committee also held an informal session with the Americas Management Team to discuss culture, brand, divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton.\n\nWith divers/i.rightty core to our purpose, this year's heightened focus on the Black Lives Matter movement acted as a spur to increase listen/i.rightng and engagement with colleagues, develop appropriate toolkits for use with clients and communit/i.rightes, and set ethnic/i.rightty targets for senior leadership in the US and UK.\n\nSince the divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton strategy was launched two years ago, the Committee has seen improvements across the key performance ind/i.rightcators, and we continue to discuss the work undertaken on inclus/i.righton and the progress being made.\n\nIn last year's report, I provided an update on the development and embedding of the Culture and Conduct Dashboards. During the year, the Committee discussed the functional/i.rightty of the Conduct Dashboard and monitored progress on embedding it across the organisat/i.righton. Committee members received a practical demonstration on how the business was using and responding to the Conduct Dashboard noting that the ins/i.rightghts would provide Management with enhanced trend analysis across the conduct risk sphere.\n\nThe Group's sustainab/i.rightlity strategy rests on three pillars. Following discuss/i.righton by the Board on the first pillar, sustainable finance, the Committee undertook deep dives into the remain/i.rightng two pillars specif/i.rightcally relating to the Group's ambit/i.righton to build its reputation and its external sustainab/i.rightlity leadership posit/i.righton, as well as the Group's work on inclus/i.rightve communit/i.rightes and promoting economic inclus/i.righton and tackling inequal/i.rightty.

Broadly, members felt that the Committee was continu/i.rightng to function highly, and that the agenda had matured over the past year. A summary of key observations and the subsequent recommendations can be found below.\n\nProgress against the actions set out in the Committee's 2020 Action Plan has been posit/i.rightve; a summary of the progress against each of the actions is set out below.\n\n## Progress against the 2020 Action Plan:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhancements to the workforce engagement framework continued during the year. The 2020 workforce engagement plans were updated in response to travel restrict/i.rightons and face-to-face sessions were replaced by four regional calls hosted by Board members\n- \u00b7 During the year, the Committee discussed the functional/i.rightty of the Conduct Dashboard and monitored progress on embedding it across the organisat/i.righton. Committee members received a practical demonstration on how the business was using and responding to the Conduct Dashboard noting that the ins/i.rightghts would provide Management with enhanced trend analysis across the conduct risk sphere\n- \u00b7 The Group's sustainab/i.rightlity strategy rests on three pillars. Following review by the Board on the first pillar, sustainable finance, the Committee undertook deep dives into the remain/i.rightng two pillars - specif/i.rightcally relating to the Group's ambit/i.righton to build its reputation and its external sustainab/i.rightlity leadership posit/i.righton, as well as the Group's work on inclus/i.rightve communit/i.rightes and promoting economic inclus/i.righton and tackling inequal/i.rightty. This included considerat/i.righton of the rapidly evolving external landscape in relation to ESG reporting and ind/i.rightces as well as the development of the Futuremakers programme\n- \u00b7 The Committee held a jo/i.rightnt strategy session with the Remuneration Committee to discuss common topics around culture, values and brand\n\n## Key observations from the 2020 internal effectiveness review\n\n- \u00b7 Committee members felt that they had made steady progress during the year on all topics in their remit\n- \u00b7 Feedback for the Chair was posit/i.rightve. The Chair allowed Committee members the time to have robust discuss/i.righton while keeping meetings on track. The Chair's style was noted as being open and inclus/i.rightve\n- \u00b7 The Committee may consider inv/i.rightting external advisers or presenters to offer different perspectives on key issues and to extend the Committee's horizons\n- \u00b7 In terms of composit/i.righton, the Committee was felt to be well stocked with relevant expertise\n- \u00b7 Committee members rated the quality of the informat/i.righton the Committee gets highly, and the Conduct Dashboard was felt to be a posit/i.rightve addit/i.righton to the Committee's work\n- \u00b7 Members noted that any exist/i.rightng overlaps between the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee and, for instance, the Remuneration Committee had been well handled during the year by holding jo/i.rightnt meetings\n\n## 2021 Action Plan\n\nThe 2021 Action Plan for the Committee reflects suggestions from the evaluation drawn together with the Committee's forward-looking agenda for next year:\n\n- \u00b7 Consider reinforc/i.rightng the Committee's expertise on sustainab/i.rightlity and environmental issues, particularly climate change\n- \u00b7 Consider inv/i.rightting further guest speakers and contributors to meetings on specif/i.rightc, key topics to add new perspectives",

As part of the Committee's succession planning for the Board, it takes into account the Group's strategy and challenges, and makes recommendations to the Board in respect of any adjustments to the Board's composit/i.righton. The Committee also: keeps under review the leadership needs of, and succession plans for, the Group in relation to both executive directors and other senior executives; has oversight of the process by which the Board, its committees and ind/i.rightvidual directors assess their effectiveness; keeps the divers/i.rightty of the Board under review and monitors progress towards achiev/i.rightng its object/i.rightves in this area; considers any potential situat/i.rightonal conflicts of interest declared by Board members; considers the impact of material changes to corporate governance regulation and legislat/i.righton affecting the Group, and has oversight of the Group's approach to subsid/i.rightary corporate governance.\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nDuring the year the Committee remained focused on ensuring that the combined skillset, experience and capabil/i.rightties of the Board further enhanced the effective oversight of the Group's refreshed strategy, while mainta/i.rightning a balanced composit/i.righton over the medium to longer/uni00A0term.\n\nLouis Cheung, a long standing INED retired from the Board in March 2020. We discussed the balance of characterist/i.rightcs, criter/i.righta and attributes required of future Board members, taking into account feedback from last year's externally facil/i.righttated effectiveness review and during the year, ident/i.rightfied and recommended to the Board the appointment of two new INEDs. Phil Rivett jo/i.rightned the Board at our AGM in May. Phil brings sign/i.rightficant professional accountancy and audit experience, specif/i.rightcally from with/i.rightn the financ/i.rightal services sector and was jo/i.rightned more recently by Maria Ramos in January 2021. Maria has extensive CEO, banking, commercial, financ/i.rightal, policy and internat/i.rightonal experience. Following the recent announcement of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's appointment as Director-General of the WTO from 1 March 2021, Ngozi will step down from the Board on 28 February 2021. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Ngozi for her valuable ins/i.rightght and contribut/i.rightons over the past 3 years.\n\nWe also refreshed the membership of a number of Board committees, most notably towards the end of the year, when Phil Rivett succeeded Naguib Kheraj as Chair of the Audit Committee and Naguib took over from David Conner as Chair of the Board Risk Committee.\n\nOur focus on succession plans remained broader than the Board and its committees. We continued to focus in detail on succession readiness and plans for the executive directors, the Management Team and other senior executives, as well as in/i.righttiat/i.rightves underway to develop talent internally. We were able to assure ourselves that succession readiness had improved through the year and that all key roles have credible plans with suitable flexib/i.rightlity for the immed/i.rightate to longer term.\n\nAs part of our annual review of the Board Divers/i.rightty Policy we discussed the importance of the Policy remain/i.rightng relevant and aligned with the divers/i.rightty of our footprint and governance recommendations, specif/i.rightcally in the area of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, knowledge, personal attributes, skills and experience. We recommended adopting a new divers/i.rightty aspirat/i.righton, that the Board is composed of a min/i.rightmum of 30/uni00A0per cent of directors from ethnic minor/i.rightty backgrounds. More detail on these changes along with the ethnic/i.rightty of our Board can be found on pages 126 to 128.\n\nThe Committee also spent time review/i.rightng plans for the Board's engagement with the workforce, taking into account the UK Corporate Governance Code provis/i.rightons. We enhanced the already sign/i.rightficant dialogue the Board has with the workforce with the introduct/i.righton of quarterly engagement calls targeted at each of the regions. With COVID-19 impact/i.rightng the abil/i.rightty for the Board to travel across our markets through 2020, these virtual sessions proved key in being able to continue our direct dialogue with the workforce across the Group. Given the ongoing travel restrict/i.rightons we are planning to further expand this engagement in 2021. Insight into the sessions held this year and the key outputs are set out on pages 105 and 106.\n\nAs part of its governance oversight role, the Committee continued to receive updates from the regional CEOs who each have responsib/i.rightlity for the subsid/i.rightary governance processes across their regions, and provide a holist/i.rightc view of the governance framework and challenges faced across the Group's footprint. The Committee also oversaw the embedding of a workable and sustainable governance structure to support the UK and GCNA hub model.\n\nThe Committee oversaw progress made in meeting the actions recommended in last year's externally conducted Board effectiveness review and agreed the approach taken to this year's internally run evaluation. Details of both are set out on page 100. We also reflected on the progress the Committee has made against those actions highl/i.rightghted in its own effectiveness review. This year's Committee effectiveness review was also conducted internally, the results of which showed some sign/i.rightficant improvements around focus and clarity of purpose. A summary of the key find/i.rightngs and actions for 2021 can be found on page 129.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als\n\nChair of the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee",

This year we recommended two important changes to the Policy, in part to keep pace with current market divers/i.rightty and governance recommendations and to align more closely to the aspirat/i.rightons of the Group. The first amendment was the adoption of an ethnic/i.rightty aspirat/i.righton of a min/i.rightmum 30 per cent from an ethnic minor/i.rightty background, demonstrating the Board's commitment to reflecting the business and network we operate. The second was to ensure that the composit/i.righton of the Board considers the Group's aspirat/i.rightons in relation to other strands of divers/i.rightty includ/i.rightng: disab/i.rightlity, sexual orientat/i.righton, gender ident/i.rightty and gender expression.\n\nWe strive to mainta/i.rightn a diverse Board recognis/i.rightng the benefits of having a Board made up of ind/i.rightviduals with a diverse mix of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, knowledge, personal attributes, skills and experience.

Broadly, members felt that the Committee's performance had improved this year, with a greater focus on timel/i.rightness of decis/i.rightons, results, and clarity of agenda and purpose. A summary of the key observations and the subsequent recommendations can be found below.\n\nProgress against the actions set out in the Committee's 2020 Action Plan has been posit/i.rightve; a summary of the progress against each of the actions is set out below.\n\n## Progress against the 2020 Action Plan\n\n- \u00b7 The development of a Board manual in relation to succession plans is ongoing, with progress expected in the year ahead\n\n## Key observations from the 2020 internal effectiveness review\n\nThe feedback from the 2020 internally conducted Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee effectiveness review was broadly posit/i.rightve. There was an overall feeling that the Committee's performance had improved during the year, with a greater focus on timel/i.rightness of decis/i.rightons, results, and clarity of agenda and purpose. Some of the key find/i.rightngs highl/i.rightghted that:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee was well chaired, with more purposeful discuss/i.righton this year\n- \u00b7 Despite the Committee having exercised dil/i.rightgent oversight of succession for key executive roles in recent years, there were not as many firm options in place as members would like\n- \u00b7 The Committee could improve its management of search consultants to raise the quality of candidate lists coming through and to improve the reach into markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East\n- \u00b7 The Committee is broadly happy with its own composit/i.righton, although there is some sensit/i.rightvity around discuss/i.rightng succession for Committee Chairs as a result\n- \u00b7 Introduced a formal template of Board skills and a matrix that tracks exist/i.rightng skills, knowledge, divers/i.rightty and experience to support the Committee's succession planning processes\n- \u00b7 Introduced a more robust and tailored Board induct/i.righton programme, for new Board and committee members\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 prevented the Board travelling through 2020, impact/i.rightng the Committee's abil/i.rightty to ensure members of the Committee had suffic/i.rightent time and contact with high-potential employees across the business. However, many of these ind/i.rightviduals continued to have exposure to the Board through presentations to the Board and committees. In person contact will resume once vis/i.rightts to markets allow for interact/i.righton and more informal sessions\n\n## 2021 Action Plan\n\nThe 2021 Action Plan for the Committee reflects suggestions from the evaluation and continues to build on the solid progress made last year:\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to enhance the induct/i.righton programme and ongoing train/i.rightng for directors\n- \u00b7 Continue to ensure suffic/i.rightent time is allocated in the annual calendar for the Committee to be exposed to internal high-potential ind/i.rightviduals\n- \u00b7 Commiss/i.righton external market mapping of candidates for key management roles\n- \u00b7 Refresh the Board skills matrix and review succession plans for Committee chairs",

David Tang and Phil Rivett attended two Committee meetings in 2020 as part of their induct/i.righton programmes. As part of, and in addit/i.righton to, each scheduled Committee meeting, the Committee held private members-only meetings.\n\nThe Committee's membership is currently comprised of five INEDs and two independent external adviser members who are neither directors nor employees of the Group, but who provide a valuable external perspective and have extensive experience in counter-terrorism, cyber security and internat/i.rightonal security.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiograph/i.rightcal details of the committee members can be viewed on pages 83 to 86\n\n## Main responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the Committee\n\nThe Committee provides oversight of the effectiveness of the Group's polic/i.rightes, procedures, systems, controls and assurance arrangements designed to ident/i.rightfy, assess, manage, monitor and prevent and/or detect money laundering, non-compliance with sanctions, bribery, corruption and tax crime by third parties. The Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nAs Chair of the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, I am pleased to present the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee's report for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Committee has placed particular focus on the impacts of COVID-19 on Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk (FCR) and colleagues working from home (WFH). The Committee was pleased to note the establishment of a Financ/i.rightal Crime Working Group to ident/i.rightfy COVID-related emerging risks and take action to address these. Furthermore, regular reporting from GIA has provided assurance on the effectiveness of controls during these unprecedented times. The Committee has continued to monitor the Group's control capabil/i.rightty to ensure the Group is well protected against FCR.\n\nThe Committee has monitored the US Supervisory Remediat/i.righton Programme and was pleased to note its closure at the end of 2020. Furthermore, in November 2020, Navigant and the New York Department of Financ/i.rightal Services completed their review activ/i.rightties related to US Demand Deposit Accounts, marking the end of the Bank's engagement with Navigant. Key lessons were learnt and the Committee has been focused to ensure that these are well embedded with/i.rightn the Group.\n\nAttention has been placed on the US-China relationsh/i.rightp and risks and challenges relating to Hong Kong/China sanctions and the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL). The Committee discussed the Group's Sanctions Policy and sought and received assurance that the Group's approach is in line with industry peers and continues to drive compliance with all laws and regulations. The CEO of Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Lim/i.rightted attended one of the discuss/i.rightons, and the Committee found it useful to hear 'on the ground' perspective on the challenges faced locally.\n\nAt the request of the Committee, papers on SC Ventures and New Payment Method Oversight were received and discussed. With regard to SC Ventures, the Committee discussed the framework adopted to ident/i.rightfy, manage and mit/i.rightgate FCR with/i.rightn SC Ventures. The balance to be struck between enabling ventures to thrive and leveraging the Group's culture, governance framework, polic/i.rightes and processes was recognised by the Committee. A discuss/i.righton was held on New Payment Method Oversight, with specif/i.rightc client examples of effective risk management. Both of these discuss/i.rightons provided useful assurance of how FCR is being managed in these areas.\n\nThe Committee has monitored the CFCC Transformation over the course of the year, which is intended to improve the effic/i.rightency of how the Group manages non-financ/i.rightal risk and to build on exist/i.rightng in/i.righttiat/i.rightves to reduce cost and improve effectiveness. Given the linkages of this to the Board Risk Committee and Audit Committee, Committee Chairs sessions were held to discuss this Transformation and ensure that associated risks are well managed, and change is implemented effectively.\n\nOne of the impacts of COVID-19 was restrict/i.rightons on physical meetings. However, the Committee was pleased to note that Correspondent Banking Academies were held virtually and that management partic/i.rightpated in a number of United for Wildl/i.rightfe hosted webinars on COVID-19 predict/i.rightons, the risk of poaching and combatting illegal wildl/i.rightfe trade (IWT), which Committee members were inv/i.rightted to attend. The Committee fully supported these virtual forums to enable the Group to continue to play a leading role in Financ/i.rightal Crime Compliance (FCC) sharing in/i.righttiat/i.rightves. The Group continues to strive to remain at the forefront of the ongoing fight against financ/i.rightal crime.\n\nThe following pages provide ins/i.rightght and context into the Committee's work and activ/i.rightties during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gay Huey Evans\n\nChair of the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee",

We have supported colleagues to work both from home and safely from Group locations for essential roles, offering flexib/i.rightlity to provide the most posit/i.rightve outcome for them and for the Group.\n\nWe mainta/i.rightned pay for employees who were unable to work full hours as a result of family care requirements and provided flexib/i.rightlity for those whose return to their usual working location was impacted because of travel restrict/i.rightons. We did not access UK Government support schemes and no colleagues were made redundant or furloughed due to the impact of COVID-19. Where business transformation that was underway before the pandemic impacted some roles, increased investment was made in redeployment and reskill/i.rightng programmes and any employees leaving the Group received their full salary for 2020, in addit/i.righton to severance pay.\n\nOur Fair Pay Charter continues to guide our performance and reward decis/i.righton-making globally and has been the compass in our approach to support colleagues fairly and consistently through the challenges of the pandemic. We have continued to implement changes to improve colleagues' experience, includ/i.rightng launching our flexible benefit plan in Poland, as part of the phased roll-out, and expanding the use of salary ranges to cover 74 per cent of colleagues globally. In 2019 we introduced fair pay reporting and our 2020 Fair Pay Report provides an update of the progress made and summarises how we meet the princ/i.rightples of our Fair Pay Charter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe 2020 Fair Pay Report can be viewed at sc.com/fairpaycharter",

        "page_content": "## Impact of COVID-19 on remuneration during 2020\n\nAs the pandemic developed the Committee considered remuneration decis/i.rightons very carefully, exercis/i.rightng judgement, taking account of the developing cris/i.rights situat/i.righton and the impact of COVID-19 on our external stakeholders and our colleagues. This included the payment of annual discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves in respect of performance in 2019 which were communicated to colleagues in February and paid in March 2020. These decis/i.rightons were made in good faith, and pre-dated the Prudential Regulation Authority's (PRA) statement at the end of March requesting that we suspend shareholder distr/i.rightbutions due to the impact of COVID-19. There are no plans for these 2019 awards to be repaid or clawed back. The Committee considered the withdrawal of the recommendation to pay a final ordinary div/i.rightdend for 2019 when making 2020 decis/i.rightons.\n\n## Our performance in 2020\n\nThroughout the year the Group has remained resil/i.rightent and competit/i.rightve, despite the economic and geopolit/i.rightcal challenges, even though our progress has inev/i.righttably slowed in some areas. The pandemic has been one of the most sign/i.rightficant events in recent history and it materially impacted the financ/i.rightal performance of most banks, includ/i.rightng us, in 2020.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 has meant that some of the measures and targets set with/i.rightn the Group scorecard at the start of 2020 were unachievable. No changes were made to business performance criter/i.righta and targets for 2020 incent/i.rightve outcomes.\n\nUnderlying profit before tax is down 40 per cent on 2019 and return on tangible equity (RoTE) is down 340 basis points to 3.0 per cent. The Group's capital is strong, with the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at a histor/i.rightcally high level, demonstrating our resil/i.rightence in the face of such an extraordinary economic shock.\n\nThe total scorecard outcome was 37 per cent with 13 per cent being based on financ/i.rightal achievements includ/i.rightng effective cost management and growth in high performing liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and 24 per cent based on non-financ/i.rightal achievements includ/i.rightng improved dig/i.righttal client onboarding, on-track development of new ventures and an improved employee net promoter score of 6 points to 17.5.\n\n## 2020 annual discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves\n\nWhilst the annual scorecard has been used as a starting point for determin/i.rightng the Group's discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves, the Committee has needed to exercise its judgement carefully.\n\nThe Committee considered several factors includ/i.rightng the Group's underlying performance, the experience of our stakeholders, the withdrawal of the 2019 final ordinary div/i.rightdend, the resil/i.rightence of our business, inherent future risks, the sign/i.rightficant contribut/i.righton of our colleagues who have continued to serve clients whilst managing the cris/i.rights and the need to compete for talent globally across 59 markets.\n\nThe Committee also considered carefully, throughout the year and when incent/i.rightves were determined, risk, control and conduct matters, review/i.rightng material issues from across the Group.\n\nConsider/i.rightng all factors, the Committee applied a downward adjustment of $160 mill/i.righton to total discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves of $1,150 mill/i.righton, resulting in overall discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves of $990 mill/i.righton, which is 23 per cent lower than 2019.\n\nIn allocating the discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves, focus was primar/i.rightly placed on Group performance given the challenges created by COVID-19 in fairly and object/i.rightvely assessing the relative performance of each business, function, region and country.\n\nThe one notable exception was with/i.rightn the Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking (CIB) business, where discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves were different/i.rightated for Financ/i.rightal Markets in order to reward colleagues for the strong performance in 2020.\n\nAcross the rest of the Group, at an ind/i.rightvidual level, focus was placed on protecting compensation levels for more jun/i.rightor colleagues as shown in the table below.\n\n|                      | Average year-on-year change (%)   | Average year-on-year change (%)                 | Average year-on-year change (%)   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                      | Number of  colleagues 1           | Annual  discret/i.rightonary  incent/i.rightves | Total  compensation               |\n| Management Team      | 11                                | (43)                                            | (23)                              |\n| Managing Directors   | 1,055                             | (34)                                            | (13)                              |\n| Other senior leaders | 2,621                             | (30)                                            | (6)                               |\n| All other colleagues | 62,304                            | (27)                                            | 0                                 |\n\n## Executive director remuneration in 2020\n\n## Annual incent/i.rightves for executive directors\n\nThe annual incent/i.rightves for Bill and Andy are directly linked to the Group scorecard outcome with potential to adjust upwards or downwards based on personal performance. In April 2020, Bill and Andy announced they will waive any cash portion of an annual incent/i.rightve award in respect of 2020 performance, reducing any potential award for 2020 by 50 per cent. In addit/i.righton, along with other members of the Management Team they made sign/i.rightficant personal donations to the COVID-19 assistance fund.\n\nBased on the scorecard assessment of 37 per cent, and the voluntary waiver of the cash element (50 per cent of the award), the Committee concluded that the annual incent/i.rightves for 2020 set out below were appropriate:\n\n| Annual incent/i.rightves for  executive directors   | Year-on-year  change   (%)   | 2020 1   | 2019       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| % of maximum                                        |                              | 18.5%    | 55%        |\n| Bill Winters (CEO)                                  | (69)                         | \u00a3385,836 | \u00a31,251,360 |\n| Andy Halford (CFO)                                  | (68)                         | \u00a3246,642 | \u00a3776,600   |\n\nThe approach impacts the annual incent/i.rightve outcomes for Bill and Andy sign/i.rightficantly more than for the wider workforce. The Committee considered the personal performance of both executive directors against their object/i.rightves and recognised their exceptional performance in leading the Group through the cris/i.rights. Taking account of the total discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightve outcomes for the wider workforce, and the broader impact of the pandemic, no adjustment has been made for personal performance to the outcome.\n\n## 2018-20 LTIP awards vesting in March 2021\n\nThe 2018-20 long-term incent/i.rightve plan (LTIP) awards are due to vest in March 2021 based on performance over three years from 2018 to 2020. Following an assessment of the performance condit/i.rightons, the expected levels of vesting are:\n\n- \u00b7 Return on equity (RoE) - 0% vesting\n- \u00b7 Total shareholder return (TSR) - 0% vesting\n- \u00b7 Strategic prior/i.rightties - 26% vesting underpinn/i.rightng our progress towards our target to deliver higher returns in the medium term, despite the challenging economic environment\n\nWe have not adjusted the performance targets to reflect the increased stretch in both the financ/i.rightal and strategic measures caused by the impact of the pandemic for exist/i.rightng LTIP awards.",

        "page_content": "The value delivered by the 26 per cent vesting outcome and included in the single total figure of remuneration is based on a share price of \u00a34.22 (the three-month average to 31 December 2020) compared with the share price at grant in 2018 of \u00a37.78. This reduces the award outcome value by 46 per cent.\n\n## Single total figure of remuneration for 2020\n\nThe 2020 annual incent/i.rightve and expected 2018-20 LTIP vesting results in a 2020 single figure for Bill of \u00a33,812,000 and for Andy of \u00a32,381,000. This represents a year-on-year decrease of 29 and 27 per cent respectively.\n\nOn 1 January 2020, the pension allowance for Bill and Andy was reduced from 20 per cent of salary to 10 per cent of salary, aligned with the UK workforce.\n\n## 2020 single total figure of remuneration \u00a3000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive directors' shareholdings\n\nA sign/i.rightficant portion of Bill and Andy's total remuneration is delivered in shares which will be released over the next eight years. The deferral, retention and recovery provis/i.rightons of their pay reinforce continued alignment with shareholder interests and the Group's long-term performance. Alignment has been demonstrated in 2020 in particular through the reduction in the value of Bill and Andy's shareholdings, their unvested deferred remuneration and their extant LTIP awards.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, both Bill and Andy had exceeded their shareholding requirement outlined below. Shares purchased voluntarily from their own funds are equivalent to 61 and 44 per cent of salary for Bill and Andy, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive directors' remuneration in 2021\n\nThe Group has adopted a highly targeted approach to salary increases for 2021 given affordabil/i.rightty constraints and the challenging macroeconomic environment, prior/i.righttis/i.rightng jun/i.rightor\n\ncolleagues who are behind market and in locations with high wage inflat/i.righton. In line with this approach, fixed pay for Bill, Andy and the Management Team will not be increased in 2021.\n\n## 2021-23 LTIP awards to be granted in March 2021\n\nAfter consider/i.rightng 2020 performance, 2021-23 LTIP awards will be granted to both Bill and Andy of 120 per cent of fixed pay in line with our policy. Subject to performance over the next three years, awards will vest pro rata over years three to seven with an addit/i.rightonal retention period of 12 months after vesting. Performance will be assessed based on RoTE with a CET1 underpin, TSR relative to a peer group, and the achievement of measures that are aligned to the Group's refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties.\n\nTo reflect the Group's ambit/i.righton to become the world's most sustainable and responsible bank and increased focus on sustainab/i.rightlity, we are adjust/i.rightng the weight/i.rightngs of the performance measures and includ/i.rightng a standalone sustainab/i.rightlity prior/i.rightty. The sustainab/i.rightlity measures have been selected carefully from our broader range of sustainab/i.rightlity aspirat/i.rightons based on their level of impact for the Group and wider society and abil/i.rightty to drive financ/i.rightal returns in the medium term. The other strategic measures have been adjusted to align with the refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties. The Committee will assess progress against the specif/i.rightc targets and proof points for the strategic measures at the end of the three-year performance period and will disclose full details of their assessment of achievement against targets at vesting.\n\n## 2021-23 LTIP performance measures and weight/i.rightngs summary\n\n|                            | Previous  weight/i.rightng   | 2021-23  weight/i.rightng   |      | Key measures/targets                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| RoTE                       | 33%                          |                             |      | 30%  \u00b7  6 to 10 per cent                                                                                                                                                                |\n| TSR                        | 33%                          |                             |      | 30%  \u00b7  Median to upper quartile                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Sustainab/i.rightlity      | -                            | 15%                         | \u00b7    | Grow our sustainable  finance business and be a  responsible company with  targets to reduce our carbon  footprint                                                                      |\n| Other  strategic  measures | 33%                          | 25%                         | \u00b7    | Grow across our client  footprint and improve   client satisfact/i.righton                                                                                                              |\n| Other  strategic  measures |                              |                             | \u00b7  \u00b7 | Drive culture of innovat/i.righton,  adopt new ways of working  and continue to increase  divers/i.rightty and culture of  inclus/i.righton Underpinned by risk and  control management |\n\nRoTE is one of the financ/i.rightal KPIs used to measure progress against our strategy (see page 1). We consider target setting carefully before each grant and set targets that are challenging and act as an effective incent/i.rightve for executive directors to execute our strategy.\n\nThe RoTE target range for 2021-23 LTIP awards is 6 to 10 per cent. This is a wider range than in previous years given the unusually uncertain macroeconomic environment, includ/i.rightng the impact of severe economic dislocat/i.rightons and low interest rates on the Group's returns. It takes into account our expectation that our refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties should allow us to improve our RoTE from the 3 per cent we delivered in 2020 to over 7 per cent by 2023 as we progressively advance to our target of over 10 per cent. The current market consensus estimate for RoTE in 2023 is 6.9 per cent.",

This creates strong alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders to create long-term value. On a maximum opportunity basis, Bill's total remuneration is delivered 68 per cent in shares (includ/i.rightng those subject to performance condit/i.rightons) and 32 per cent in cash.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlignment has been demonstrated in 2020 in particular through the reduction in the value of Bill and Andy's shareholdings, their unvested deferred remuneration and their extant LTIP awards. The chart on the next page shows Bill's increased shareholding since 2019 (increased by 19 per cent) and the decrease in value (decreased by 22 per cent).",

        "page_content": "## Group-wide remuneration in 2020\n\n## Our Fair Pay Charter\n\nOur Fair Pay Charter sets out 10 princ/i.rightples we use to guide performance and reward decis/i.righton-making globally, and has been fundamental to our approach to supporting colleagues through the challenges of the pandemic, acting as a compass for consistent and fair decis/i.righton-making as we rapidly adapted to support new ways of working.\n\nIn February 2020 we published our second internal Fair Pay Report to all colleagues to explain how our performance and reward approach meets the princ/i.rightples of the Charter and to provide an update on areas where we are working to enhance our approach. In addit/i.righton we published our first external Fair Pay Report to share our progress with wider stakeholders. Both reports were well received.\n\n## How do we understand the views of our workforce?\n\nThere is a wide range of mechanisms the Group uses to seek feedback from colleagues on remuneration as well as other workforce polic/i.rightes and practices. Our 2020 engagement survey was completed by over 74,500 employees and 3,600 non-employed workers, answering questions on how they feel about different areas of reward. We also conducted an annual survey that asked employees about their experience of the performance and pay review process, includ/i.rightng whether they understand variable pay, whether they believe performance and pay decis/i.rightons are fair, and whether they understand the princ/i.rightples which form our Fair Pay Charter.

                                  |\n\n## Transforming our business\n\nWe have continued to transform our Group which has affected some colleagues. This was no change from our pre-pandemic plans. Where business transformation was already underway before the pandemic, we entirely paused all restructuring activ/i.rightty for the first half of the year. Once activ/i.rightty resumed, increased investment was made in redeployment and reskill/i.rightng programmes. Given the unique circumstances, we adjusted our redundancy approach and all colleagues impacted in 2020 received enhanced support, ensuring they received their full salary for the year, in addit/i.righton to severance pay and improved outplacement support.\n\n## Future ready workforce\n\nConsistent with Princ/i.rightple 8 of the Fair Pay Charter, we are focused on how we adapt and remain future-ready in response to the evolving nature of work and changing expectations from clients and colleagues.\n\nContinuous learning is central to this, ensuring colleagues are able to adapt, upskill, reskill and retool not only to be better at their current jobs but to ensure they can develop and grow for new roles to best serve our clients in the future. In March 2020 we launched a new dig/i.righttal learning platform, actively encouraging colleagues to adopt a learning mindset through setting and pursuing 'aspirat/i.rightonal' goals and developing their careers. Since the launch more than 55,000 colleagues have accessed learning content and engagement in our second global learning week (over 400 events) spurred this on.\n\nThe pandemic has brought into focus the way in which our business and the ways of working are rapidly changing. Throughout the year we have listened to colleagues' preferences for greater flexib/i.rightlity in working arrangements as we come out of the pandemic. Responses to our 2020 annual survey highl/i.rightghted that 74 per cent of colleagues would choose to work from home or another non-primary workplace for at least 50 per cent of the time and 77 per cent told us they feel able to choose a reasonable balance between personal and work life. Rather than simply offering flexible working (which we had in all markets before COVID-19) we intend to implement a hybrid approach combin/i.rightng virtual and officebased working with greater flexib/i.rightlity in working patterns and locations, balancing colleague preference and business demands. A review of all roles (where and how they can be done) showed that more than 80 per cent of roles are suitable for some form of flexible working. Beginn/i.rightng in 2021, employees in eight markets will be able to apply for formal flexi-working arrangements, with subsequent markets expected through 2021 to mid-2022.\n\n## Other fair pay developments in 2020\n\nWe have made good progress in implement/i.rightng the princ/i.rightples of our Charter since its launch in 2018 and implementat/i.righton continues as our new ways of working evolve. During 2020 we have made further progress to improve colleagues' experience, includ/i.rightng:",

Strong and broad-based growth in the in/i.righttial months was followed by lower income year-on-year in the second half and for the year overall driven by the effects of COVID-19, which led to severe global economic contraction and substantially reduced interest rates. As a result, pre-provis/i.righton operating profit declined despite lower expenses. Underlying profit fell because of substantially higher credit impa/i.rightrments due mainly to provis/i.rightons against credit losses booked in the first half driven by the deteriorat/i.righton in the macroeconomic outlook. The Group remains strongly capital/i.rightsed despite the external challenges, with a CET1 ratio of 14.4 per cent above the top of the medium-term target range enabling recommencement of shareholder distr/i.rightbutions.\n\nThe total scorecard outcome was 37 per cent with 13 per cent being based on financ/i.rightal achievements includ/i.rightng effective cost management and growth in high-performing liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, and 24 per cent based on non-financ/i.rightal achievements includ/i.rightng improved dig/i.righttal client onboarding, on-track development of new ventures and an improved employee net promoter score of 6 points to 17.5.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe annual scorecard is the starting point for determin/i.rightng the Group's annual discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves. Based on the 37 per cent outcome, and without any discret/i.rightonary adjustment, total 2020 discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves would have been $1,150 mill/i.righton.\n\nHowever the Committee has exercised its judgement carefully for 2020 and considered several factors includ/i.rightng the Group's underlying performance, the experience of our stakeholders, the withdrawal of the 2019 final ordinary div/i.rightdend, the resil/i.rightence of our business, inherent future risks, the sign/i.rightficant contribut/i.righton of our colleagues whilst managing the cris/i.rights and the need to compete for talent globally across 59 markets.\n\nConsider/i.rightng all factors, the Committee applied a downward adjustment of $160 mill/i.righton, resulting in total discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves of $990 mill/i.righton, which is 23 per cent lower than 2019 and the lowest in the last five years. $129 mill/i.righton of the total discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves is deferred and charged in future years, includ/i.rightng $21 mill/i.righton in LTIP awards for senior management, the value of which will be determined by Group performance over the period 2021 to 2023.\n\n## Total discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves - last five years ($ mill/i.righton)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn allocating discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves for 2020, we thought carefully about how to reflect the challenges of the pandemic and the need to recognise the collective contribut/i.righton of colleagues to the Group's performance.

Consider elig/i.rightbil/i.rightty: The Committee considered that each director had exhib/i.rightted an appropriate level of conduct against targets set and was deemed to have met the gateway requirement to be elig/i.rightble for an incent/i.rightve.\n\n## 2. Evaluate performance against the Group's scorecard:\n\n- Throughout the year the Group has remained resil/i.rightent and competit/i.rightve, despite the economic and geopolit/i.rightcal challenges, even though our progress has inev/i.righttably slowed in some areas. The impact of COVID-19 has meant that some of the measures and targets set with/i.rightn the Group scorecard at the start of 2020 were unachievable. No changes were made to performance criter/i.righta and targets for 2020 incent/i.rightve outcomes. Underlying profit before tax is down 40 per cent on 2019 and RoTE is down 340 basis points to 3.0 per cent. The Group's capital is strong, with the CET1 ratio at a histor/i.rightcally high level, demonstrating our resil/i.rightence in the face of such an extraordinary economic shock. Full details of the scorecard outcome can be seen on page 144.\n\n## 3. Assess personal performance and final/i.rightse awards: As\n\n- outlined in the policy, the Committee can make an upwards or downwards adjustment to the scorecard outcome for personal performance, consistent with the approach for other employees who are elig/i.rightble to be considered for discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves. When consider/i.rightng whether such an adjustment is appropriate, the Committee considers the particular areas of responsib/i.rightlity of the executive director together with the object/i.rightves that they were asked to prior/i.righttise for the year and their personal contribut/i.righton to the scorecard outcome. The adjustment will usually be in the range of +/- 10 percentage points to the scorecard outcome.\n\n## Assessment of personal performance and final/i.rightsed awards\n\n## Bill Winters\n\nA summary of some of Bill's 2020 achievements against his key personal object/i.rightves is set out as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Bill has led the Group exceptionally well through diff/i.rightcult circumstances in 2020\n- \u00b7 Bill has delivered resil/i.rightent performance in light of the pandemic, build/i.rightng on the foundations he has laid since his appointment which put the Group in a posit/i.righton to absorb large shocks such as COVID-19\n- \u00b7 Bill has been the ultimate driver of change for dig/i.righttal partnerships, data and artif/i.rightcial intell/i.rightgence, and SC Ventures\n- \u00b7 Bill recently assumed the role as a Chair of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, helping increase the Group's standing around sustainab/i.rightlity\n\nThe Committee considered Bill's performance in the context of the sign/i.rightficant challenges of 2020 and noted his performance against his key object/i.rightves in the year. Taking into account his request to waive the cash portion of any incent/i.rightve in respect of 2020 (representing 50 per cent of any annual incent/i.rightve), the Committee determined that despite the exceptional personal performance leading the Group through the cris/i.rights, no upward adjustment should be made. This results in an award of \u00a3385,836 (\u00a31,251,360 in 2019) which equates to 18.5 per cent of the maximum opportunity and 15 per cent of fixed pay (44 per cent in 2019).\n\n## Andy Halford\n\nA summary of some of Andy's 2020 achievements against his key personal object/i.rightves and in response to the pandemic cris/i.rights is set out below:\n\n- \u00b7 Andy led the completion of the restructuring of the Group's legal entit/i.rightes during the year, which has resulted in realised benefits being contributed to the delivery of our strategy\n- \u00b7 Andy delivered the completion of the sale of the Group's interest in PT Bank Permata Tbk, demonstrating sign/i.rightficant progress on our strategic prior/i.rightties and placing the Group in a strong posit/i.righton to give us confidence through the cris/i.rights period\n- \u00b7 Andy responded effectively to the liqu/i.rightdity challenges resulting from COVID-19, demonstrating the resil/i.rightence of the Group\n- \u00b7 Andy chaired the Cris/i.rights Management Team and oversaw the Property function in response to the pandemic\n- \u00b7 Andy continued to deliver improvements in effic/i.rightency, with an ongoing focus that has continued to flow through to financ/i.rightal results\n- \u00b7 Andy has been key in the new ways of working in/i.righttiat/i.rightve, enabling the Group's drive for productiv/i.rightty with effective ways to measure and track our progress, crit/i.rightcal for our success\n\nThe Committee considered Andy's performance in the context of the sign/i.rightficant challenges of 2020 and noted his performance against his key object/i.rightves in the year. Taking into account his request to waive the cash portion of any incent/i.rightve in respect of 2020 (representing 50 per cent of any annual incent/i.rightve), the Committee determined that despite the exceptional personal performance leading the Group through the cris/i.rights, no upward adjustment should be made. This results in an award of \u00a3246,642 (\u00a3776,600 in 2019) which equates to 18.5 per cent of the maximum opportunity and 15 per cent of fixed pay (44 per cent in 2019).",

The awards were then subject to RoE and relative TSR targets and a qualitat/i.rightve and quantitat/i.rightve assessment of the strategic measures.\n\nThe Committee concluded that Bill and Andy exhib/i.rightted appropriate conduct during the performance period and therefore the conduct gateway was met. The threshold RoE\n\nPerformance for\n\nPerformance for\n\nVesting\n\ntarget has not been achieved and the relative TSR threshold target will be measured in March 2021 but is estimated not to have been achieved and, therefore, there will be no vesting for the 66.6 per cent of the awards subject to these measures.\n\nThe Committee considered performance against the proof points as set out in the table below and determined that the overall vesting of the LTIP would be 26 per cent. The table below sets out the performance required, the 2018-20 performance achieved and the LTIP vesting outcome. The share price used to estimate the value of vesting of the 2018-20 LTIP awards is lower than the share price on the award date of \u00a37.78 and therefore the value attributable to share price growth is nil. The value of the awards vesting is reduced by 46 per cent when compared to the value at grant.\n\nNo discret/i.righton has been applied to the vesting outcome of the LTIP in respect of performance targets or share price movement. The awards will vest pro rata over 2021 to 2025 and shares will be subject to a 12-month retention period post-vesting. Malus and clawback provis/i.rightons apply.\n\n| Measure                                           | Weight/i.rightng                          | min/i.rightmum vesting (25%)              | maximum vesting (100%)   | Assessment of achievement                                                                      | outcome   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| RoE 1  in 2020 with   CET1 underpin               | One-third                                 | 6.0%                                      | 9.0%                     | RoE 2.6% and CET1 14.4%   therefore 0% vesting                                                 | 0%        |\n| Relative TSR  performance against  the peer group | One-third                                 | Median                                    | Upper quartile           | Performance currently estimated  below median.

        "page_content": "## LTIP awards for the executive directors to be granted in 2021\n\nThe size of the LTIP award has been determined based on Group and ind/i.rightvidual performance during the year. Awards for the 2020 performance year will be granted to Bill and Andy in March 2021 with a value of 120 per cent of fixed pay (\u00a33.1 mill/i.righton and \u00a32.0 mill/i.righton, respectively). This is the maximum amount receivable, unless the share price appreciates. The amount that the executive directors will receive at the end of the three-year performance period will be based on the level of performance achieved against the performance measures and the future share price.\n\nWe consider target setting carefully before each grant and set targets that are challenging and act as an effective incent/i.rightve for executive directors to execute our strategy. To reflect the Group's ambit/i.righton to become the world's most sustainable and responsible bank and increased focus on sustainab/i.rightlity, we are adjust/i.rightng the weight/i.rightngs of the performance measures and includ/i.rightng a standalone sustainab/i.rightlity measure.\n\nThe sustainab/i.rightlity measures have been selected carefully from our broader range of sustainab/i.rightlity aspirat/i.rightons based on their level of impact for the Group and wider society and abil/i.rightty to drive financ/i.rightal returns in the medium term. The other strategic measures have been adjusted to align with the refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties. Details of the sustainab/i.rightlity and other strategic measures and targets are shown in the table on the next page and are disclosed prospectively, except where the internal targets are considered commercially sensit/i.rightve. Detailed disclosure of achievement against all internal targets will be disclosed retrospectively at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe RoTE target range for 2021-23 LTIP awards is 6 to 10 per cent. This is a wider range than in previous years given the unusually uncertain macroeconomic environment, includ/i.rightng the impact of severe economic dislocat/i.rightons and low interest rates on the Group's returns. It takes into account our expectation that our refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties should allow us to improve our RoTE from the 3 per cent we delivered in 2020 to over 7 per cent by 2023 as we progressively advance to our target of over 10 per cent. The current market consensus estimate for RoTE in 2023 is 6.9 per cent.\n\nThe peer group of companies selected for the calculation of the relative TSR performance are companies with generally comparable business activ/i.rightties, size or geographic spread to Standard Chartered or companies with which the Group competes for investor funds and talent. The peer group is intended to be representative of the Group's geographic presence and business operations. The companies that make up the peer group are reviewed annually, prior to each new LTIP grant.\n\nThe TSR peer group for 2021-23 LTIP awards will be the same as for the 2020-22 LTIP and is detailed on the next page. TSR is measured in sterling for each company and the TSR data is averaged over a month at the start and end of the three-year measurement period which starts from the date of grant.\n\nRemuneration regulations for European banks mean that div/i.rightdend equivalent shares are not permitted to be awarded on vesting. The number of shares awarded in respect of the LTIP will take into account the lack of div/i.rightdend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield) such that the overall market value of the award is mainta/i.rightned.\n\nThese awards will vest in five annual tranches beginn/i.rightng after the third anniversary of the grant (i.e. March 2024 to March 2028) subject to meeting the performance measures set out below at the end of 2023. All vested shares are subject to a 12-month retention period.\n\nThe performance measures for the 2021-23 LTIP awards are set out in the table on the next page.",

Consistent with the Group's treatment of all employees, the Committee can make an adjustment to the annual incent/i.rightve if the executive director's performance is considered improved and is not fully reflected in the scorecard outcome (and vice versa), if appropriate. The Committee will generally consider personal performance adjustments in the range of up to +/- 10 percentage points on the scorecard outcome.\n\n## Independent non-executive director fees\n\nThe fee levels are based on market data and the duties, time commitments and contribut/i.righton expected for the PLC Board and, where appropriate, subsid/i.rightary boards.

Our scorecard includes financ/i.rightal and strategic measures and all employees' performance is assessed by what is achieved and how it is achieved in line with our valued behaviours\n- \u00b7 In combinat/i.righton with our risk procedures, our remuneration structure ensures that our valued behaviours are appropriately recognised and rewarded\n\n## Proportional/i.rightty\n\n- \u00b7 In line with our commitment to pay for performance, a sign/i.rightficant proportion of executive director pay is delivered through incent/i.rightves based on performance metrics aligned to our strategy\n- \u00b7 Executive directors are further aligned to long-term shareholder interests through the deferred release of salary, annual incent/i.rightve and LTIP share awards over a period of one to eight years with incent/i.rightve awards also being subject to clawback for up to 10/uni00A0years from grant\n- \u00b7 Addit/i.rightonal shareholding requirements are in place for executive directors to build and mainta/i.rightn a sign/i.rightficant shareholding in Company shares whilst in employment and post-employment for two years. Both executive directors currently exceed the shareholding requirements\n\n## Predictab/i.rightlity\n\n- \u00b7 The range of possible rewards to ind/i.rightvidual executive directors is set out in the scenario charts on page 151 where we also demonstrate the impact of a 50 per cent share price appreciat/i.righton over the three-year performance period of the LTIP\n- \u00b7 Maximum awards levels under all incent/i.rightves are capped at twice fixed pay. Other than vesting levels which are driven by performance outcomes, the only source of variat/i.righton in final payouts is the fact that a sign/i.rightficant part of incent/i.rightve awards is delivered in shares and so linked to the share price\n\n## Simpl/i.rightcity and clarity\n\n- \u00b7 Simpl/i.rightcity is a key driver for the structure of our executive pay as far as possible, notwithstand/i.rightng the complexity of operating as a UK regulated bank\n- \u00b7 Addit/i.rightonal informat/i.righton is included on the alignment of executive and wider workforce pay on page 138 in support of our commitment to clarity.",

Total pay is calculated in line with the single figure methodology (i.e. fixed remuneration accrued during the financ/i.rightal year and variable remuneration relating to the performance year) and data for insured benefits are based on notional premia. No other calculation adjustments or assumptions have been made\n- \u00b7 CEO pay is as per the single total figure of remuneration for 2020 and restated for 2019 to take account of the actual LTIP vesting in 2020.

Each of the ind/i.rightviduals ident/i.rightfied was a full-time employee during the year and received remuneration in line with the Group remuneration policy, and none received exceptional pay\n- \u00b7 Our LTIP is intended to link total remuneration to the achievement of the Group's long-term strategy and to reinforce alignment between executive remuneration and shareholder interest. As set out on page 138, partic/i.rightpation is therefore typically senior employees who have line of sight to influence directly the performance targets on the awards. The lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees ident/i.rightfied this year are not partic/i.rightpants in the LTIP\n- \u00b7 The year-on-year decrease is due to the CEO receiv/i.rightng lower variable remuneration in relation to 2020: an annual incent/i.rightve award of 18.5 per cent of maximum (55 per cent in 2019) and an LTIP award vesting at 26 per cent (38 per cent in 2019)\n\n## Group performance versus the CEO's remuneration\n\nThe graph below shows the Group's TSR performance on a cumulative basis over the past 10 years alongside that of the FTSE/uni00A0100 and peer banks.

As no ind/i.rightviduals are employed by Standard Chartered PLC (they are employed by legal entit/i.rightes which sit below the parent company) we have voluntarily disclosed the comparisons against UK employees as we feel this provides a representative comparison.\n\n|                              | Salary/fees  % change  2020   | Taxable benefits  % change  2020   | Annual incent/i.rightve  % change   2020   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| CEO                          |                               |                                    |                                            |\n| B Winters                    | 0.7                           | (2.9)                              | (69.2)                                     |\n| CFO                          |                               |                                    |                                            |\n| A Halford                    | 3.7                           | 30.2                               | (68.2)                                     |\n| Group Chairman               |                               |                                    |                                            |\n| J Vi\u00f1als                     | 0.0                           | (11.7)                             | -                                          |\n| Current INEDs                |                               |                                    |                                            |\n| L Cheung 1                   | -                             | -                                  | -                                          |\n| D P Conner                   | (0.6)                         | (57.5)                             | -                                          |\n| B E Grote                    | 0.0                           | 0.0                                | -                                          |\n| C M Hodgson, CBE             | 0.0                           | 28.2                               | -                                          |\n| G Huey Evans, OBE            | 0.0                           | 233.9                              | -                                          |\n| N Kheraj                     | 0.0                           | 7.9                                | -                                          |\n| N Okonjo-Iweala              | 0.0                           | 63.6                               | -                                          |\n| P Rivett 1                   | -                             | -                                  | -                                          |\n| D Tang 2                     | -                             | -                                  | -                                          |\n| C Tong 2                     | -                             | -                                  | -                                          |\n| J M Whitbread                | 0.0                           | (49.2)                             | -                                          |\n| Workforce                    |                               |                                    |                                            |\n| Average FTE UK employee 3, 4 | 3.8                           | 2.9                                | (22.1)                                     |\n\n- 2  In 2019: Carlson Tong and David Tang were appointed to the Board on 21 February and 12 June, respectively\n- 3 Employee data is based on full-time equivalent pay for UK employees as at 31 December of the relevant year. This data excludes leavers, jo/i.rightners and employee transfers in or out of the UK during the year to help ensure data is on a like-for-like basis. Salary percentage change reflects increases decided at the end of 2019 and implemented in 2020\n- 4  Average FTE UK employee percentage change has been calculated on a mean basis. As the employee population will change yearly and the mean average considers the full range of data, it is expected this will provide a more consistent year-on-year comparison. Any percentage changes impacted by extremes at either end of the data set will be explained in the supporting commentary\n\nFor the CEO and CFO and the Group Chairman and INEDs, the data the changes relate to are set out on pages 146 and 150, respectively. The change in taxable benefits relates to the change in the values for the 2019/20 and 2018/19 tax years.\n\nDue to the low value of the taxable benefits received by INEDs, which have not exceeded \u00a37,000 in 2020 (set out on page 150), small changes to these values are expected to cause the percentage change to fluctuate year-on-year.\n\n## Scheme interests awarded, exercised and lapsed during the year\n\nEmployees, includ/i.rightng executive directors, are not permitted to engage in any personal investment strategies with regards to their Company shares, includ/i.rightng hedging against the share price of Company shares.

From 1 January 2017 remuneration regulations for European banks mean that div/i.rightdend equivalent shares are not permitted to be awarded therefore the number of shares awarded in respect of the 2018-20, 2019-21 and 2020-22 LTIP awards took into account the lack of div/i.rightdend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield) such that the overall value of the award was mainta/i.rightned",

The Group's share plans contain monitored lim/i.rightts that govern both the aggregate amount of awards that may be granted and the amount of shares that may be issued to satisfy any subsequent exercise of awards.

Material risk takers are ident/i.rightfied on a (i) Standard Chartered PLC (Group) and (i/i.right) solo level consolidated entit/i.rightes under Standard Chartered Bank UK (Solo) basis.\n\n## Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nThe quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta ident/i.rightfy employees who:\n\n- \u00b7 Have been awarded total remuneration of EUR500,000 or more in the previous financ/i.rightal year\n- \u00b7 Are with/i.rightn the 0.3 per cent of the number of employees on a Group or Solo basis who have been awarded the highest total remuneration in the preceding financ/i.rightal year\n- \u00b7 Were awarded total remuneration in the preceding financ/i.rightal year that was equal to or greater than the lowest total remuneration awarded that year to certain specif/i.righted groups of employees\n\nEmployees ident/i.rightfied by only the quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta can be excluded from being ident/i.rightfied as material risk takers if it can be evidenced that they do not have the abil/i.rightty to have a material impact on the risk profile of the Group or the Solo entity.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nThe qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta broadly ident/i.rightfies the following employees:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors (both executive and non-executive) of Standard Chartered PLC\n- \u00b7 A member of senior management, which is defined as one or more of the following:\n- -  A senior manager under the PRA or Financ/i.rightal Conduct Authority (FCA) Senior Manager Regime\n- -  A member of the Group Management Team and the Solo Management Team\n- \u00b7 The level beneath the Management Teams\n- \u00b7 Senior employees with/i.rightn the Audit, Compliance, Legal and Risk functions\n- \u00b7 Senior employees with/i.rightn material business units\n- \u00b7 Employees who are members of specif/i.rightc committees\n- \u00b7 Employees who are able to in/i.righttiate or approve credit risk exposures above a certain threshold and sign off on trading book transactions at or above a specif/i.rightc value at risk lim/i.rightt\n\nFor the purpose of the Pillar 3 tables on pages 164 and 165, unless otherwise stated, senior management is defined as directors of Standard Chartered PLC (both executive and non-executive), senior managers under the PRA or FCA Senior Manager Regime and members of the Group Management Team.\n\n## Material risk takers' remuneration delivery\n\nRemuneration for material risk takers was delivered in 2020 through a combinat/i.righton of salary, pension, benefits and variable remuneration.\n\nVariable remuneration for material risk takers is structured in line with the PRA and FCA's remuneration rules. For the 2020 performance year, the following structure applies to variable remuneration awarded to material risk takers in accordance with the regulations:\n\n- \u00b7 At least 40 per cent of a material risk taker's variable remuneration will be deferred over a min/i.rightmum period of three years depending on the category of material risk taker\n- \u00b7 Non-deferred variable remuneration will be delivered 50 per cent in shares, subject to a min/i.rightmum 12-month retention period, and 50 per cent in cash\n- \u00b7 At least 50 per cent of deferred variable remuneration will be delivered entirely in shares, subject to a min/i.rightmum 12-month retention period (with the exception of deferred shares awarded to risk managers, which are subject to a six-month min/i.rightmum retention period) in line with the regulations\n- \u00b7 For some material risk takers, part of their 2020 variable remuneration may be in share awards which vest after a min/i.rightmum of three years, subject to the satisfact/i.righton of performance measures\n- \u00b7 Variable remuneration awards are subject to remuneration adjustment provis/i.rightons. This provides the Group with the abil/i.rightty to reduce or revoke variable remuneration in respect of a risk, control or conduct issue, event or behaviour\n- \u00b7 Material risk takers are subject to the 2:1 maximum ratio of variable to fixed remuneration\n\nSome material risk takers had been scheduled to receive the cash portion of their incent/i.rightves after 31 March 2020, when the PRA issued their statement in relation to cash bonuses in response to COVID-19. This was after the main scheduled delivery of cash incent/i.rightves in the March 2020 payroll. Where this was the case, share-based payments replaced outstanding cash incent/i.rightve awards that would otherwise have been paid to material risk takers in the period April to December 2020. Such share-based payments were funded through exist/i.rightng shares held in the employee benefit trust.",

This was util/i.rightsed to reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue and as part of the Group's approach to div/i.rightdend growth and capital returns. In response to a request from the PRA and as a consequence of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board decided to suspend the buy-back programme in March 2020. The share buy-back programme was launched on 2 March 2020 and ended on 31 March 2020. A total of 40,029,585 ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.50 were re-purchased for an approximate aggregate considerat/i.righton paid of $242/uni00A0mill/i.righton.\n\nA monthly breakdown of the shares purchased during the period includ/i.rightng the lowest and highest price paid per share is set out in Note 28 to the financ/i.rightal statements. All ordinary shares which were bought back were cancelled.",

The Rules are intended to ensure that there is no favourable treatment to Temasek or its associates to the detriment of other shareholders in the Company. Unless transactions between the Group and Temasek or its associates are specif/i.rightcally exempt under the Rules or are subject to a specif/i.rightc waiver, they may require a combinat/i.righton of announcements, reporting and independent shareholders' approval.\n\nOn 27 December 2018, the HKSE extended a waiver ('the Waiver') it previously granted to the Company for the revenue banking transactions with Temasek which do not fall under the passive investor exemption (the Passive Investor Exemption) under Rules 14A.99 and 14A.100. Under the Waiver, the HKSE agreed to waive the announcement requirement, the requirement to enter into a written agreement and set an annual cap and the reporting (includ/i.rightng annual review) requirements under Chapter 14A for the three-year period ending 31 December 2021 on the condit/i.rightons that:\n\n- a)  The Company will disclose details of the Waiver (includ/i.rightng nature of the revenue banking transactions with Temasek and reasons for the Waiver) in subsequent annual reports, and\n- b)  The Company will continue to monitor the revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2021 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded",

        "page_content": "The main reasons for seeking the Waiver were:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature and terms of revenue banking transactions may vary and evolve over time; having fixed-term written agreements would not be suitable to accommodate the various banking needs of the Company's customers (includ/i.rightng Temasek) and would be impract/i.rightcal and unduly burdensome\n- \u00b7 It would be impract/i.rightcable to estimate and determine an annual cap on the revenue banking transactions with Temasek as the volume and aggregate value of each transaction are uncertain and unknown to the Company as a banking group due to multiple factors includ/i.rightng market driven factors\n- \u00b7 The revenues generated from revenue banking transactions were ins/i.rightgnif/i.rightcant. Without a waiver from the HKSE or an applicable exemption, these transactions would be subject to various percentage ratio tests which cater for different types of connected transactions and as such may produce anomalous results\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group provided Temasek with money market placement products and services that were revenue transactions in nature. As a result of the Passive Investor Exemption and the Waiver, the vast major/i.rightty of the Company's transactions with Temasek and its associates fall outside of the connected transactions regime. However, non-revenue transactions with Temasek or any of its associates continue to be subject to monitor/i.rightng for connected transaction issues. The Company confirms that:\n\n- \u00b7 The revenue banking transactions entered into with Temasek in 2020 were below the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio test under the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules, and\n- \u00b7 It will continue to monitor revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2021 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded\n\nThe Company therefore satisf/i.righted the condit/i.rightons of the Waiver.\n\n## Non-revenue transaction with Temasek\n\nTemasek and the Group entered into the following nonrevenue transaction during the year ended 31 December 2020, in respect of which an announcement was published by the Company on 26 March 2020 (the Announcement).\n\nOn 26 March 2020, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsid/i.rightary, Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Lim/i.rightted (SCBSL), entered into the investment agreement (Investment Agreement) with Clifford Capital Holdings Pte. Ltd. (CCH), the special purpose vehicles wholly owned by Temasek, namely, Kovan Investments Pte. Ltd. and Aranda Investments Pte. Ltd. (Temasek SPVs) and DBS Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsu/i.right Banking Corporation, Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (Pte) Lim/i.rightted, John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) (collectively the Other Transaction Parties), pursuant to which SCBSL (i) agreed to swap its exist/i.rightng shares in Clifford Capital Pte. Ltd. (CCPL) for ordinary shares in the capital of CCH (CCH Shares) at a 1:1 exchange ratio and (i/i.right) committed to contribute addit/i.rightonal funds to CCH up to a total amount of $43,438,824 by way of subscript/i.righton for CCH Shares as and when called by CCH with/i.rightn the period commencing on 26 March 2020 and ending on 31 December 2025 (the Commitment Period) at a price of $1.6775 per CCH Share. Such addit/i.rightonal funds will be util/i.rightsed to support further business growth at CCPL and the expansion of new business lines under CCH.\n\nThe princ/i.rightpal terms of the Investment Agreement are as follows:\n\n- i.   SCBSL will sell its shares in CCPL to CCH for the aggregate amount of $33,705,585.94, such amount to be wholly satisf/i.righted by (i) the allotment and issue of 22,770,000 CCH Shares to SCBSL and (i/i.right) the transfer of 99 incorporation CCH Shares from the CCH company secretary to SCBSL;\n- i/i.right.  SCBSL undertakes to contribute addit/i.rightonal funds in the total amount of $43,438,824 to CCH by way of subscript/i.righton for CCH Shares as and when called by CCH during the Commitment Period;\n- i/i.righti.  SCBSL currently holds 9.9% of CCPL. Following completion of the steps in (i) above, SCBSL will hold 9.9% of CCH. Following completion of the steps in (i/i.right) above, SCBSL is antic/i.rightpated to mainta/i.rightn a 9.9% holding in CCH; and\n- i v.  failure to subscribe for CCH Shares as and when called by CCH will result in SCBSL's shareholding in CCH being diluted and will entitle other shareholders to acquire its CCH Shares at a discount to the lower of fair market value and book value.\n\nOn 26 March 2020, SCBSL also entered into the shareholders' agreement (Shareholders' Agreement) between CCH, the Temasek SPVs and the Other Transaction Parties. The Shareholders' Agreement contains terms and shareholder rights customary for transactions of this nature, includ/i.rightng as to board representation, voting, transfer restrict/i.rightons and exit provis/i.rightons. SCBSL's material rights in this regard include:\n\n- i.   the right to appoint a director for so long as it holds 5% or more of the CCH Shares (see subsequent changes to this right below);\n- i/i.right.  customary pre-emptive rights to subscribe, on a pro rata basis, for new equity securit/i.rightes to be issued by CCH;\n- i/i.righti.  a right of first refusal in respect of the transfer of CCH Shares by other shareholders; and\n- i v.  a tag along right in the event of a sale by one of the Temasek SPVs that would result in the occurrence of certain events.\n\nAny sale of CCH Shares by SCBSL will be subject to customary pre-emptive rights in favour of the other shareholders. As Temasek and its associates are connected persons of the Company, and by virtue of Temasek holding more than 30% of the issued share capital of CCH and CCPL, CCH and CCPL are connected persons of the Company. Pursuant to Chapter 14A of the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules, the entry into the Investment Agreement and the Shareholders' Agreement between SCBSL, CCH, the Temasek SPVs and the Other Transaction Parties constitutes a connected transaction for the Company.\n\nSubsequent to the Announcement, Asian Development Bank (ADB) made a commitment to invest $95 mill/i.righton into CCH on 8 September 2020, pursuant to which SCBSL entered into a restated and amended Investment Agreement and Shareholders' Agreement with CCH, the Temasek SPVs, ADB and the Other Transaction Parties. SCBSL's rights and obligat/i.rightons remain unchanged in all material respects, except that under the restated and amended Shareholders' Agreement, at any time on or before 31 December 2024, SCBSL's right to appoint a director would only be retained for so long as it holds 7.5% of the CCH shares, as opposed to the previous threshold of 5%. On or after 1 January 2025, the shareholding percentage threshold to trigger SCBSL's right to appoint a director would revert to 5%.",

The Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement can be found on page 250\n\nIn accordance with Article 435(e) of the Capital Requirements Regulation, the Board Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has considered the adequacy of the risk management arrangements of the Group and has sought and received assurance that the risk management systems in place are adequate with regard to the Group's profile and strategy.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for mainta/i.rightning and review/i.rightng the effectiveness of the internal control system. Its effectiveness is reviewed regularly by the Board, its committees, the Management Team and Group Internal Audit.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2020, the Board Risk Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control. As part of this review, confirmat/i.righton was received that the Group Chief Risk Officer is satisf/i.righted that the Group's risk management and internal control framework is materially effective and adequately highl/i.rightghts risks and improvement areas for management attention. Group Internal Audit represents the third line of defence and provides independent assurance of the effectiveness of management's control of business activ/i.rightties (the first line) and of the control processes mainta/i.rightned by the Risk Framework Owners and Policy Owners (the second line). The audit programme includes obtain/i.rightng an understanding of the processes and systems under audit review, evaluating the design of controls, and testing the operating effectiveness and outcomes of key controls. The work of Group Internal Audit is focused on the areas of greatest risk as determined by a risk-based assessment methodology. The Board considers the internal control systems of the Company to be effective and adequate.\n\nGroup Internal Audit reports regularly to the Audit Committee, the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive; and the Group Head, Internal Audit reports directly to the Chair of the Audit Committee and admin/i.rightstratively to the Group Chief Executive. The find/i.rightngs of all adverse audits are reported to the Audit Committee, the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive where immed/i.rightate corrective action is required. The Board Risk Committee has responsib/i.rightlity for overseeing the management of the Company's fundamental risks as well as review/i.rightng the effectiveness of the Company's Enterprise Risk Management Framework.

The Board has established a management structure that clearly defines roles, responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes and reporting lines.\n\nDelegated authorit/i.rightes are documented and communicated. Executive risk committees regularly review the Group's risk profile. The performance of the Group's businesses is reported regularly to senior management and the Board. Performance trends and forecasts, as well as actual performance against budgets and prior periods, are monitored closely. Financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton is prepared using appropriate accounting polic/i.rightes, which are applied consistently.\n\nOperational procedures and controls have been established to facil/i.righttate complete, accurate and timely processing of transactions and the safeguarding of assets. These controls include appropriate segregation of duties, the regular reconcil/i.rightation of accounts and the valuation of assets and posit/i.rightons. In respect of handling ins/i.rightde informat/i.righton, we have applied relevant controls on employees who are subject to handling ins/i.rightde informat/i.righton, includ/i.rightng controls over the dissem/i.rightnation of such informat/i.righton and their dealings in the Company's shares. Such systems are designed to manage rather than elim/i.rightnate the risk of failure to achieve business object/i.rightves and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## Employee polic/i.rightes and engagement\n\nWe work hard to ensure that our employees are kept informed about matters affecting or of interest to them, but more importantly to provide opportunit/i.rightes for feedback and dialogue.\n\nWe continue to listen and act on feedback from colleagues to ensure internal communicat/i.rightons remain impactful and meaningful, in support of the Group's strategy and transformation. In addit/i.righton to the Bridge (our business collaboration platform) which allows colleagues to receive key updates, exchange ideas and provide feedback, we also leverage a range of channels includ/i.rightng email broadcasts, newsletters with customised content for each employee, audio and video calls, town halls and other engagement events. To continue to improve the way we communicate and ensure our employee communicat/i.rightons remain relevant we period/i.rightcally analyse and measure the impact of our communicat/i.rightons.",

Naturally COVID-19 was a major element of communicat/i.righton with our employees in 2020 and pleasingly 91% of those surveyed in April said they were satisf/i.righted with the communicat/i.righton they were getting from the organisat/i.righton about its response to the pandemic, and 90% felt senior leadership were effective in leading. More informat/i.righton on this engagement survey and our annual My Voice survey can be found with/i.rightn the employee's section of the Strategic report.\n\nAcross the organisat/i.righton, team meetings with people leaders, one-to-one discuss/i.rightons, and management meetings enable our people to discuss and clarify matters of concern to them as employees. There are global communicat/i.rightons from our Group Chief Executive, supported by local meetings with regional and country CEOs to discuss the annual financ/i.rightal results and overall performance. Performance conversations provide the opportunity to discuss how ind/i.rightviduals, the team and the business area have contributed to our overall performance and, in full year conversations, how any compensation awards relate to this.\n\nThe Board listens to the view of workforce through several sources, includ/i.rightng informat/i.righton reported from senior management on culture and directly via workforce engagement sessions. More informat/i.righton can be found on pages 105 and 106 in the Directors' report.\n\nEmployees, past, present and future can follow our progress through the Group's LinkedIn network and Facebook page, and other social network channels, which collectively have over 1.8 mill/i.righton followers.\n\nThis mix of channels ensures that all our colleagues receive relevant informat/i.righton promptly regardless of how they prefer to be communicated with and regardless of where they sit in the organisat/i.righton.\n\nThe wellbeing of our employees is central to our think/i.rightng about benefits and support, so they can thrive at work and in their personal lives. Our Group min/i.rightmum standards provide employees with a range of flexible working options, and, in terms of leave, at least 30 days' leave (through annual leave and public holidays), a min/i.rightmum of 20 calendar weeks' fully paid maternity leave, a min/i.rightmum of two calendar weeks of leave for spouses or partners, and two calendar weeks for adoption leave. Combined, this is above the International Labour Organisat/i.righton min/i.rightmum standards.\n\nWe seek to build productive and enduring partnerships with various employee representative bodies (includ/i.rightng unions and work councils). In our recognit/i.righton and interact/i.rightons, we are heavily influenced by the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and several International Labour Organisat/i.righton (ILO) conventions includ/i.rightng the Right to Organise and Collective Bargain/i.rightng Convention, 1949 (No. 98) and the Freedom of Associat/i.righton and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87). Addit/i.rightonally, we abide by all local country labour laws and regulations that protect employees' rights to organise.\n\nThe Group Grievance Standard provides a formal framework to deal with concerns that employees have in relation to their employment or another colleague, which affects them directly, and cannot be resolved through informal mechanisms, e.g. counselling, coaching or mediat/i.righton. This can include bullying, harassment or discr/i.rightminat/i.righton situat/i.rightons, and concerns around condit/i.rightons of employment (e.g. health and safety, work relations, new working practices or working environment). There is a dist/i.rightnct Group Speaking Up Policy which covers instances where an employee wishes to 'blow the whistle' on actual, planned or potential (non-employment related) wrongdoing by another employee or the Group.\n\nThe Group is committed to creating a fair, consistent, and transparent approach to making decis/i.rightons in a disc/i.rightplinary context. This commitment is codif/i.righted in our Fair Accountabil/i.rightty Princ/i.rightples, which underpin our Group Disc/i.rightplinary Standard.\n\nDism/i.rightssals due to misconduct issues and/or performance (where required by law to follow a disc/i.rightplinary process) are governed by the Group Disc/i.rightplinary Standard. Where local law or regulation requires a different process with regards to dism/i.rightssals and other disc/i.rightplinary outcomes, we have country variances in place.\n\nOur Group Divers/i.rightty and Inclusion Standard (the Standard) has been developed to ensure a respectful workplace, with fair and equal treatment, divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton, and the provis/i.righton of opportunit/i.rightes for employees to partic/i.rightpate fully and reach their full potential in an appropriate working environment. All ind/i.rightviduals are entitled to be treated with dign/i.rightty and respect, and to be free from harassment, bullying, discr/i.rightminat/i.righton and vict/i.rightmisat/i.righton.

It is Group policy to ensure that the more stringent of the two requirements is always met, ensuring our H&S practices meet or exceed the regulatory min/i.rightmum. Compliance rates are reported quarterly to each country's management team. H&S performance and risks are reported annually to the Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.

This Framework covers sales practices, client communicat/i.rightons, appropriateness and suitab/i.rightlity, and post-sales practice. As part of this, we ensure products sold are suitable for clients and comply with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nWe have processes and guidel/i.rightnes specif/i.rightc to each of our client businesses, to promptly resolve client complaints, understand and respond to client issues. Conduct considerat/i.rightons are given sign/i.rightficant weight/i.rightng in front-line incent/i.rightve structures to drive the right behaviours.\n\n## Group Code of Conduct\n\nThe Board has adopted a Group Code of Conduct (the Code) relating to the lawful and ethical conduct of business and this is supported by the Group's valued behaviours. It has been communicated to all directors and employees, all of whom are expected to observe high standards of integr/i.rightty and fair dealing in relation to customers, employees and regulators in the communit/i.rightes in which the Group operates. Directors and employees are asked to recommit to the Code annually, and 99.8 per cent have completed the 2020 recommitment. All Board members have recommitted to the Code.\n\n## Managing environmental and social risk\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that high standards of responsible business are mainta/i.rightned and that an effective control framework is in place. This encompasses risk associated with clients' operations and their potential impact on the environment, includ/i.rightng climate change, and local communit/i.rightes.\n\nThe Board recognises its responsib/i.rightlity to manage these risks and that failure to manage them adequately could have adverse impact on stakeholders as well as the Group. The Board, via the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee, reviews sustainab/i.rightlity prior/i.rightties, and oversees the development of, and delivery against, public commitments regarding the activ/i.rightties and/or businesses that the Group will or will not accept in alignment with our Here for good brand promise.\n\nAt a management level, the CEO, Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking is responsible for sustainable finance, which incorporates E&S risk management. In 2020, this included the release of our first Sustainab/i.rightlity Bond Impact Report and managing our COVID-19 $1 bill/i.righton facil/i.rightty. The Group Head, Corporate Affairs, Brand & Marketing, Conduct, Financ/i.rightal Crime and Compliance leads a cross-business Sustainab/i.rightlity Forum to develop and deliver the Group's broader sustainab/i.rightlity strategy. In addit/i.righton, climate change is integrated into the Group-wide approach to risk management as a material cross-cutting risk to be considered.\n\nThe Board welcomed the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures (TCFD). The Group has set out how climate change considerat/i.rightons are being incorporated into its governance, strategy, risk management and target-setting activ/i.rightties in its stand-alone TCFD report.

For more on how we engage with communit/i.rightes go to page 70 of the Sustainable and Responsible Business section.\n\n## ESG reporting guide\n\nWe comply with the requirements for environmental, social and governance reporting under Appendix 27 of the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules with the exception of A1.3 on hazardous waste and A1.6 on production and handling of hazardous waste and A2.5 on packaging. As an office-based financ/i.rightal services provider, we generate min/i.rightmal hazardous waste or packaging material. As such, these issues are not material and we do not report them.\n\n## Environmental impact of our operations\n\nWe aim to min/i.rightmise the environmental impact of our operations as part of our commitment to be a responsible company. We report on energy, water, paper and nonhazardous waste data that are the basis of our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emiss/i.rightons management, as well as the targets we have set to reduce energy, water and paper use.\n\nOur reporting criter/i.righta document sets out the princ/i.rightples and methodology used to calculate the GHG emiss/i.rightons of the Group. For more informat/i.righton, review the reporting criter/i.righta at sc.com/environmentcriter/i.righta\n\nDisclosures related to the Group's environmental polic/i.rightes and performance are included in the Sustainable and responsible business section of the Strategic report on page 68.\n\nOur reporting methodology is based upon the World Resources Institute/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edit/i.righton). We report on all emiss/i.righton sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic report and Directors' reports) Regulations.\n\nUsing conversion factors from the International Energy Agency 2019 Emiss/i.rightons Factors and the UK Government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), emiss/i.rightons are reported in metric tonnes of carbon diox/i.rightde equivalent (CO2e), encompassing the six Kyoto gases. Our defin/i.righttion of different emiss/i.righton sources is provided below.\n\nScope 1 Scope 1 emiss/i.rightons are defined as aris/i.rightng from the consumption of energy from direct sources, such as by burning diesel with/i.rightn generators, during the use of property occupied by the Group.\n\nScope 2 Scope 2 emiss/i.rightons are defined as aris/i.rightng from the consumption of ind/i.rightrect sources of energy, such as consumption of purchased electric/i.rightty and heat, during the use of property occupied by the Group. Consider/i.rightng the amendment issued to the GHG Protocol in 2015, we report Scope 2 emiss/i.rightons under location-based and market-based methods. We continue to monitor the development of Scope 2 Quality Criter/i.righta, as well as the development of residual mixes by national agencies. We have recently added market-based reporting as we have found data has become more available on emiss/i.rightons. The Group does not currently use any form of offset such as carbon credits to offset Scope 1 or Scope 2 emiss/i.rightons; however, we will inst/i.rightgate an offset programme in/uni00A02021.\n\nScope 3 Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons are defined as occurring as a consequence of the Group's activ/i.rightties but aris/i.rightng from sources not controlled by us. The Group currently reports on Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons aris/i.rightng from air travel and our outsourced data centres globally.\n\n## Reporting period\n\nThe reporting period of our environmental data is from 1/uni00A0October 2019 to 30 September 2020. This allows suffic/i.rightent time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publicat/i.righton of results. Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same time period rather than the calendar year used in financ/i.rightal reporting.\n\n## Assurance\n\nOur Scope 1 and 2 emiss/i.rightons are assured by an independent body, Global Documentation, against the requirements of ISO14064.\n\n| Indicator                                                     | 2020         | 2019      | 2018       | Units                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| Headcount                                                     | 83,657       | 84,398    | 85,402     | Headcount                     |\n| Net internal area of occupied property covered   by reporting | 1,050,414    | 1,154,999 | 1,185,929  | m 2                           |\n| Annual operating income from 1 October to   30 September      | 15,233       | 15,200    | 14,958     | $m                            |\n| Greenhouse gas emiss/i.rightons                               |              |           |            |                               |\n| Scope 1 emiss/i.rightons (combustion of fuels)                | 3,988        | 4,542     | 8,584      | tonnes CO2 eq/year            |\n| Scope 2 emiss/i.rightons (purchased electric/i.rightty)       | 113,870      | 141,771   | 139,366    | tonnes CO2eq/year             |\n| Scope 1 and 2 emiss/i.rightons                                | 1 1 7, 8 5 8 | 146,313   | 1 47,9 5 0 | tonnes CO2eq/year             |\n| Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons with distance uplift (air travel)    | 33,811       | 94,043    | 121,464    | tonnes CO2eq/year             |\n| Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons (Global Data Centre)                 | 29,562       | 46,362    | 21,523     | tonnes CO2eq/year             |\n| Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emiss/i.rightons                       | 181,231      | 286,718   | 290,937    | tonnes CO2eq/year             |\n| Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emiss/i.rightons/Headcount             | 2.17         | 3.40      | 3.41       | tonnes CO2eq/  Headcount/year |\n| Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emiss/i.rightons/m 2                   | 173          | 248       | 245        | kg CO2eq/m 2 /year            |\n| Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emiss/i.rightons/operating income      | 11.90        | 18.86     | 19.45      | tonnes CO2eq/$m/year          |",

Further details regarding the format, location and business to be transacted will be disclosed with/i.rightn the 2021 Notice of AGM.\n\nOur 2020 AGM was held on 6 May 2020 at 11:00am (UK time) (6:00pm Hong Kong time) at 1 Basinghall Avenue, London, EC2V 5DD, United Kingdom. Special business at the meeting included the approval of the power to allot ECAT1 Securit/i.rightes for cash without certain formalit/i.rightes.\n\nAll/uni00A0resolutions were passed at the meeting, the details of which can be viewed on our website.\n\n## Terminat/i.righton of Indian Depository Receipt (IDR) programme\n\nIn March 2020, the Group announced the terminat/i.righton of the IDR programme. The terminat/i.righton notice period ended on 15 June 2020. The approximately 750,000 underlying Standard Chartered PLC ordinary shares that these IDRs represented were sold on the London Stock Exchange on 22 June 2020 and the net sale proceeds distr/i.rightbuted to the relevant IDR holders. The IDR programme was formally delisted from the BSE Lim/i.rightted (formerly the Bombay Stock Exchange) and National Stock Exchange of India Lim/i.rightted with effect from 22 July 2020.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nThe Group's non-audit services policy (the policy) was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee on 27 July 2020. The policy is based on an overrid/i.rightng princ/i.rightple that, to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, the Group's auditor should only be used when either there is evidence that there is no alternative in terms of quality and there is no conflict with their duties as auditor. EY can be used where the work is required by a regulator or competent authority.\n\nThe policy clearly sets out the criter/i.righta for when the Audit Committee's prior written approval is required. The policy requires a conservative approach to be taken to the assessment of requests for EY to provide non-audit services. Subject to the overrid/i.rightng princ/i.rightple, the Audit Committee's view is that EY can be of value in a range of non-audit service activ/i.rightties and should be allowed to tender subject to the terms of the policy. The Group is required to take a conservative approach to interpret/i.rightng the potential threats to auditor independence and requires commensurately robust safeguards against them.\n\nEU legislat/i.righton and guidance from the FRC sets out threats to audit independence includ/i.rightng self-interest, self-review, famil/i.rightarity, taking of a management role or conducting advocacy. In particular, mainta/i.rightning EY's independence from the Group requires EY to avoid taking decis/i.rightons on the Group's behalf. It is also recognised as essential that management retains the decis/i.righton-making capabil/i.rightty as to whether to act on advice given by EY as part of a non-audit service. This means not just the abil/i.rightty to action the advice given, but to have suffic/i.rightent knowledge of the subject matter to be able to make a reasoned and independent judgement as to its valid/i.rightty. All of this is contained with/i.rightn the policy.\n\nBy way of (non-exhaustive) illustrat/i.righton of the applicat/i.righton of the princ/i.rightples set out in the policy, the following types of non-audit services are likely to be permiss/i.rightble under the policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of inter/i.rightm financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton and verif/i.rightcation of inter/i.rightm profits - the Group would also extend this to work on investor circulars in most foreseeable circumstances\n- \u00b7 Extended audit or assurance work on financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton and/or financ/i.rightal or operational controls, where this work is closely linked to the audit engagement\n- \u00b7 Agreed upon procedures on materials with/i.rightn or referenced in the annual report of the Group or an entity with/i.rightn the Group\n- \u00b7 Internal control review services\n\nStrictly prohib/i.rightted under the policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Bookkeeping, informat/i.righton technology and valuation services\n- \u00b7 Internal audit, lit/i.rightgation support or corporate finance services\n- \u00b7 Tax or regulatory structuring proposals\n- \u00b7 Services where fees are paid on a contingent basis (in whole or in part)\n- \u00b7 Consulting services that actively assist in running the business in place of management as opposed to provid/i.rightng or validat/i.rightng informat/i.righton, which management then util/i.rightses in the operation of the business\n\nThe policy is not a prescribed list of non-audit services that EY is permitted to provide. Rather, each request for EY to provide non-audit services will be assessed on its own merits. The Audit Committee believes that such a case-by-case approach best accommodates (i) the need for the appropriate rigour and challenge to be applied to each request for EY to provide non-audit services while (i/i.right) preserving suffic/i.rightent flexib/i.rightlity for the Group to engage EY to provide non-audit services where they are able to deliver particular value to the Group and where the proposed services can be provided without compromis/i.rightng EY's object/i.rightvity and independence. To ensure that the Group will comply with a cap that lim/i.rightts fees on non-audit services provided by EY to under 70 per cent of the average Group audit fee from the previous three consecutive financ/i.rightal years, (which will apply from EY's fourth year of being the Group's external auditor), the policy requires that annual non-audit service fees are lower than 70 per cent of the average annual Group audit fee up to this time. The caps exclude audit related non-audit services and services carried out pursuant to legislat/i.righton. For 2020 the ratio, without deducting non-audit service fees which were required by law or regulation and performed by EY, was 36 per cent. Details relating to EY's remuneration as the Group statutory auditor and a descript/i.righton of the broad categories of the types of non-audit services provided by EY are given in Note 38 to the financ/i.rightal statements.",

        "page_content": "## Risk update\n\nAll risk types, both financ/i.rightal and non-financ/i.rightal, are managed and reported in accordance with the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Our key highl/i.rightghts from the past year are shown here.\n\n## Key highl/i.rightghts 2020\n\n- \u00b7 Asset quality has deteriorated against a challenging macroeconomic environment\n- \u00b7 Credit impa/i.rightrment more than doubled, reflecting the impact of COVID-19\n- \u00b7 The Group remains highly liqu/i.rightd and our capital posit/i.righton has strengthened further\n\n## Our portfolio quality\n\nCOVID-19 and the related economic shock has impacted our loan portfolio. The wide-ranging disrupt/i.righton to supply chains and normal business practices, in addit/i.righton to the human cost of the pandemic, has placed intense pressure on the major/i.rightty of our markets. Despite this, we have delivered resil/i.rightent performance with risk fundamentals remain/i.rightng solid in the face of unprecedented challenges. This has been helped by actions we have taken over the past five years to build a strong foundation and ensure our portfolios remain resil/i.rightent.\n\nThe impact has varied dramatically across markets and sectors but by leveraging our stress testing capabil/i.rightties and conducting portfolio reviews, we have ident/i.rightfied and proactively managed a number of portfolios that were at risk as the cris/i.rights unfolded. Collateral remains strong in the Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking books and we continue to support clients and offer alternative financ/i.rightng options where available.\n\nIn the second half of the year, we began to see signs of recovery in some markets as actions taken by governments helped to lim/i.rightt the economic effects of the pandemic. However, despite in/i.righttial vaccine rollouts, cases increased as 2020 came to a close, and lockdowns have been reintroduced in a number of territor/i.rightes. We remain cognisant that the recovery will be uneven globally, and the threat of prolonged weak economic outlooks may lead to a sustained period of increased risk aversion and uncertainty.\n\nIn the first half of the year, we placed selected clients on our watchlist categories for close monitor/i.rightng, and have conducted extensive portfolio and sector reviews, particularly for areas with higher vulnerabil/i.rightty to COVID-19 and volatile crude oil markets, such as our Aviat/i.righton, Hospital/i.rightty and Oil & Gas exposures. This has led to a $5.4 bill/i.righton increase in early alerts exposure (2020: $10.7 bill/i.righton; 2019: $5.3 bill/i.righton). This is a reduction of $3.7 bill/i.righton compared with 30 June 2020, with just over half due to reductions in exposure and regularisat/i.rightons, and the remainder due to downgrades. As a result, Credit Grade 12 loans have increased to $2.2 bill/i.righton (2019: $1.6 bill/i.righton) as outflows to non-performing loans were offset by inflows from early alert categories.\n\nThe proportion of the Group's loans and advances to customers in stage 1 and 2 has remained broadly consistent with the end of 2019, at 89 per cent and 8 per cent respectively, as we continue to focus on high-quality orig/i.rightnation. The percentage of investment grade corporate exposure has also increased slightly to 62 per cent compared with 61 per cent a year ago. Stage 3 loans to customers increased to $9.2 bill/i.righton (2019: $7.4 bill/i.righton), although they remained at 3 per cent of overall loans and advances.\n\nThere has been an increase in exposure to our Top 20 corporate clients as a percentage of Tier 1 Capital to 60 per cent (2019: 56 per cent); however this has reduced slightly since half year. This is primar/i.rightly driven by an increase in exposure to a few investment grade clients. The Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking portfolios remain predominantly short-tenor and continue to be divers/i.rightfied across industry sectors, products, and geographies.\n\nOur Retail Banking portfolio remains stable and resil/i.rightent, with stage 1 loans increas/i.rightng by $9 bill/i.righton in 2020 driven by growth in mortgage products. Stage 1 loans now represent 97 per cent of the Retail Banking portfolio (2019: 96 per cent). The major/i.rightty of Retail products continue to be fully secured loans, which have increased slightly to 86 per cent of total loans (2019: 85 per cent). The overall average loan-to-value of the mortgage portfolio remains low at 45 per cent. The unsecured loan portfolio has remained flat compared with the previous year.\n\nAverage Group value at risk (VaR) in 2020 was $108 mill/i.righton, a sign/i.rightficant increase compared with the previous year (2019: $30 mill/i.righton), driven by the extreme market volatil/i.rightty in interest rates and credit spreads following the outbreak of COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices. The increase in VaR was predominantly observed in the non-trading book from credit bonds held in the Treasury Markets liqu/i.rightd assets buffer which are almost exclusively of investment grade. Trading activ/i.rightties remain primar/i.rightly client driven.\n\nDespite challenges brought by COVID-19, the Group has remained resil/i.rightent and kept a strong liqu/i.rightdity and funding posit/i.righton. The Group Liqu/i.rightdity Coverage Ratio was broadly stable year-on-year, closing December 2020 at 143 per cent (2019: 144 per cent) as the liqu/i.rightdity buffer and net outflows both increased in line with overall balance sheet growth. Customer deposits increased by 9 per cent driven by growth in stable current and savings account balances, which was offset by a decrease in term deposits, as we sought to manage liqu/i.rightdity more effic/i.rightently. Customer loan growth was mainly driven by mortgages in Hong Kong and Korea. The increase in overall deposits drove a decrease in the Group's advances-to-deposits ratio which reduced to 61 per cent (2019: 64 per cent).\n\nThe Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased by 60 basis points (bps) to 14.4 per cent, which is above the top end of our target range of 13 to 14 per cent.",

A number of management actions have been taken since the start of the year, includ/i.rightng enhancing our monitor/i.rightng of facil/i.rightty drawdowns, improv/i.rightng the Group's posit/i.righton through reducing exposures where required.\n\nThe Group has continued to support clients we believe are experienc/i.rightng temporary issues due to COVID-19 and we have enacted comprehensive support schemes for retail and corporate customers, includ/i.rightng loan and interest repayment holidays, covenant relief, fee waivers or cancellations, loan extensions and new facil/i.rightties. In Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking, around 54 per cent of the amounts outstanding have a remain/i.rightng tenor of 90 days or less, and approximately 19 per cent of the amounts outstanding are to clients in vulnerable sectors.\n\nIn Retail Banking, various short-term relief measures have been implemented and we have increased engagement with our customers to find alternative financ/i.rightng options where available. As of 31 December 2020, approximately 2 per cent of total Retail Banking exposure has relief measures approved, of which 81 per cent is fully secured with an average loan-tovalue of less than 40 per cent. The portfolio under moratoria reduced from $8.9 bill/i.righton at its peak in the first half of the year/uni00A0(a sign/i.rightficant portion of which was applied to all elig/i.rightble loans and generally mandated or supported by regulators) to $2.4 bill/i.righton, mainly concentrated in Singapore and Hong Kong which are largely secured.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment remains challenging for the major/i.rightty of the markets in our footprint and we are cognisant of the potential longer-term impact, especially once relief measures are eased. This will lead to an uneven recovery even as the global economy is expected to return to growth in 2021 and beyond.\n\nWe are managing exposures to a set of ident/i.rightfied vulnerable sectors, includ/i.rightng Aviat/i.righton * , Oil & Gas, Commodity Traders, Metals & Min/i.rightng, Commercial Real Estate and Hotels & Tourism, particularly closely, and net exposure decreased by $6 bill/i.righton in 2020. These sectors now represent 27/uni00A0per cent (31 December 2019: 30 per cent) of the total net exposure in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking, with reductions largely due to increased levels of collateral and reduced undrawn commitments, particularly in the Commodity Traders, Metals and Min/i.rightng, and Commercial Real Estate sectors.\n\n## Stage 3 loans\n\nOverall gross credit-impa/i.rightred (stage 3) loans for the Group increased by 25 per cent in 2020, from $7.4 bill/i.righton to $9.2 bill/i.righton, driven by downgrades in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking.\n\nGross credit-impa/i.rightred (stage 3) loans in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking increased by 32 per cent (2020: $5.5 bill/i.righton; 2019: $4.2 bill/i.righton) driven by sign/i.rightficant client downgrades in ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle East across unrelated sectors. Total stage 3 inflows across Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking tripled to $3.6 bill/i.righton in 2020, compared with $1.2 bill/i.righton the previous year, driven by a few major downgrades. These stage 3 inflows were offset by $1.2 bill/i.righton of write-offs and $1.0 bill/i.righton of recoveries. Stage 3 loans in Commercial Banking increased marginally from $2.0 bill/i.righton to $2.1 bill/i.righton.\n\nPrivate Banking stage 3 loans remained broadly stable at $0.4/uni00A0bill/i.righton.\n\nStage 3 loans in the Retail Banking portfolio increased by $0.3 bill/i.righton driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the portfolio, but remains at 1 per cent of total Retail loans.\n\n- * In addit/i.righton to the Aviat/i.righton sector loan exposures, the Group owns $3.9 bill/i.righton of aircraft under operating leases.

        "page_content": "The stage 3 cover ratio in the total customer loan book decreased by 10 percentage points to 58 per cent (2019: 68/uni00A0per cent) mainly in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking. This was driven by write-offs and new stage 3 loans with low levels of coverage, which benefit from credit insurance and guarantees, includ/i.rightng from export credit agencies. The/uni00A0cover ratio includ/i.rightng tangible collateral decreased to/uni00A076/uni00A0per cent (2019: 85 per cent) with some of the 2020 downgrades being covered by guarantees and insurance which are not included as tangible collateral.\n\n## Credit impa/i.rightrment\n\nAt Group level, the total credit impa/i.rightrment charge includ/i.rightng the restructuring portfolio is $2.3 bill/i.righton (2019: $0.9 bill/i.righton), representing a loan loss rate of 66 bps of average customer loans and advances (2019: 27 bps). Increases were seen across all three stages, with stage 3 impa/i.rightrment up $823 mill/i.righton, of which more than 60 per cent is from Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment increased by $565 mill/i.righton, over half of which is due to management overlays of $353 mill/i.righton, with the remainder due to deteriorat/i.rightng macroeconomic forecasts and stage downgrades as a result of COVID-19 uncertaint/i.rightes.\n\nCredit impa/i.rightrment for Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking has increased sign/i.rightficantly to $1,237 mill/i.righton, compared with $475/uni00A0mill/i.righton last year. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrments increased by $226 mill/i.righton in part due to a judgemental overlay estimat/i.rightng the impact of further deteriorat/i.righton to the early alert portfolio, as well as deteriorat/i.righton of macroeconomic forecasts and stage downgrades from clients impacted by COVID-19 volatil/i.rightty. Stage 3 impa/i.rightrments also increased by $536 mill/i.righton driven by three sign/i.rightficant but unrelated downgrades in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nCommercial Banking credit impa/i.rightrment also increased by $194/uni00A0mill/i.righton (2020: $316 mill/i.righton, 2019: $122 mill/i.righton). Stage 3 impa/i.rightrment increased by $111 mill/i.righton due to a few new client downgrades partly driven by the impact of the pandemic. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrments increased to $70 mill/i.righton in 2020 compared with a release of $13 mill/i.righton the previous year. There was also a judgemental overlay for expected future early alert deteriorat/i.righton.\n\nRetail Banking credit impa/i.rightrment has more than doubled (2020: $715 mill/i.righton, 2019: $336 mill/i.righton). Stage 3 impa/i.rightrment was higher particularly in ASEAN & South Asia unsecured products, as volatil/i.rightty created by the pandemic resulted in a slowdown in field collections. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment more than doubled compared with 2019 at $414 mill/i.righton. This was due to deteriorat/i.rightons in macroeconomic forecasts and higher flows to stage 2, as well as an overlay of $156 mill/i.righton to account for the expected increase in delinquenc/i.rightes once government relief measures in our key markets expire.\n\nPrivate Banking impa/i.rightrment increased to $2 mill/i.righton as 2019 saw a material provis/i.righton release in ASEAN & South Asia.\n\nCentral & Others saw impa/i.rightrment of $24 mill/i.righton (2019: $4 mill/i.righton), driven by stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment from stage downgrades of sovereign clients in the Africa & Middle East region.\n\nCredit impa/i.rightrment in the restructuring portfolio was a net $31/uni00A0mill/i.righton from the Group's discont/i.rightnued businesses.\n\n|                                          | 2020                         | 2020                     | 2020                   | 2019                         | 2019                     | 2019                  |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                          | Stage 1 & 2  $mill/i.righton | Stage 3  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Stage 1 & 2  $mill/i.righton | Stage 3  $mill/i.righton | Total $mill/i.righton |\n| Ongoing business portfolio               |                              |                          |                        |                              |                          |                       |\n| Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking | 321                          | 916                      | 1,237                  | 95                           | 380                      | 475                   |\n| Retail Banking                           | 414                          | 301                      | 715                    | 175                          | 161                      | 336                   |\n| Commercial Banking                       | 70                           | 246                      | 316                    | (13)                         | 135                      | 122                   |\n| Private Banking                          | (2)                          | 4                        | 2                      | 1                            | (32)                     | (31)                  |\n| Central & Others                         | 24                           | -                        | 24                     | 4                            | -                        | 4                     |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment charge          | 827                          | 1,467                    | 2,294                  | 262                          | 644                      | 906                   |\n| Restructuring business portfolio         |                              |                          |                        |                              |                          |                       |\n| Others                                   | -                            | 31                       | 31                     | 1                            | 1                        | 2                     |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment charge          | -                            | 31                       | 31                     | 1                            | 1                        | 2                     |\n| Total credit impa/i.rightrment charge    | 827                          | 1,498                    | 2,325                  | 263                          | 645                      | 908                   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the risk performance for 2020 is set out in the Risk profile section ( pages 185 to 247 )",

We mainta/i.rightn a dynamic risk-scanning process for risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and assessment, with inputs from the internal and external risk environment, as well as potential threats and opportunit/i.rightes from the business and client perspectives, enabling us to proactively manage our portfolio. We mainta/i.rightn an inventory of the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types and risk sub-types that are inherent to the strategy and business model; and emerging risks that include near-term as well as longer-term uncertaint/i.rightes.\n\n## Our risk profile in 2020\n\n## Strong risk management underpinned by the ERMF\n\n- \u00b7 As part of the Group's commitment to be a leader in sustainable and responsible banking, environmental, social and governance risks have been incorporated with/i.rightn the expanded Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk Type Framework\n- \u00b7 Conduct Risk and Country Risk have been embedded as overarching components of the ERMF, rather than viewed as standalone risks\n- \u00b7 Operational Risk has been expanded to include Technology Risk to meet the needs of the dig/i.righttal agenda of the Group\n- \u00b7 We are making good progress on integrat/i.rightng Climate Risk into mainstream risk management\n- \u00b7 Self-assessments performed in our footprint markets reflect the use of the ERMF and Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types, with reinforced first line ownership\n- \u00b7 Overall ERMF effectiveness has improved year-on-year, with a substantial focus on development of non-financ/i.rightal risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on the ERMF can be found on pages 248 to 253\n\nThe Group's portfolios continue to exhib/i.rightt a resil/i.rightent risk profile.

Work done in previous years to build a strong foundation, includ/i.rightng reducing our concentration to single names and high-risk sectors and increas/i.rightng the proportion of investment grade assets, and actions taken in response to the heightened level of risk in the environment brought on by the pandemic, have helped to mit/i.rightgate deteriorat/i.righton in our portfolios and risk profile.\n\nThe table below highl/i.rightghts the Group's overall risk profile associated with our business strategy.\n\n## Resil/i.rightent performance despite a challenging macroeconomic environment\n\n- \u00b7 Investment grade corporate net exposures have increased slightly to 62 per cent (2019: 61 per cent)\n- \u00b7 The Group's proportions of stage 1 and stage 2 loans and advances to customers are broadly consistent at 89 per cent and 8 per cent respectively\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans increased to $9.2 bill/i.righton (up 25 per cent), although they remain at a consistent proportion of overall loans and advances. The overall stage 3 cover ratio has reduced to 58 per cent (2019: 68 per cent) mainly in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking, driven by write-offs and new stage 3 loans with low levels of coverage, which benefit from credit insurance and guarantees includ/i.rightng from export credit agencies\n- \u00b7 Early alerts increased by $5.4 bill/i.righton to $10.7 bill/i.righton on the back of proactive portfolio and sector reviews, particularly for vulnerable sectors\n- \u00b7 Total credit impa/i.rightrment more than doubled to $2.3 bill/i.righton, reflecting the impact of COVID-19, with stage 3 impa/i.rightrment up $0.8 bill/i.righton\n- \u00b7 86 per cent of our Retail Banking portfolio is fully secured (2019: 85 per cent). The average loan-to-value ratio of retail mortgages remains low at 45 per cent\n- \u00b7 Average Group value at risk (VaR) was $108 mill/i.righton (2019: $30 mill/i.righton), driven by the extreme market volatil/i.rightty due to COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices\n\n## Our capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.rightons remain robust\n\n- \u00b7 We remain well capital/i.rightsed and our balance sheet remains highly liqu/i.rightd\n- \u00b7 Our liqu/i.rightdity buffer and cash outflows both grew in 2020 in line with overall balance sheet growth, and our Liqu/i.rightdity Coverage Ratio remains strong and broadly stable at 143 per cent\n- \u00b7 Our advances-to-deposits ratio decreased by 3.1 per cent to 61.1 per cent, driven by an increase in overall deposits\n- \u00b7 Our customer deposit base is divers/i.rightfied by type and maturity",

CGs 1 to 12 are assigned to stage 1 and stage 2 (performing) clients or accounts, while CGs 13 and 14 are assigned to stage 3 (defaulted) clients. The mapping of credit quality is as follows.\n\n## Mapping of credit quality\n\nThe Group uses the following internal risk mapping to determine the credit quality for loans.\n\n|                                    | Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking   | Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking   | Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking   | Private Banking 1      | Retail Banking                                         |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit quality  descript/i.righton | Internal grade   mapping                                          | S&P external ratings  equivalent                                  | Regulatory PD range (%)                                           | Internal ratings       | Number of days past due                                |\n| Strong                             | 1A to 5B                                                          | AAA to BB+                                                        | 0 to 0.425                                                        | Class I and Class IV   | Current loans (no past  dues nor impa/i.rightred)      |\n| Satisfactory                       | 6A to 11C                                                         | BB to B-/CCC                                                      | 0.426 to 15.75                                                    | Class II and Class III | Loans past due till  29/uni00A0days                    |\n| Higher risk                        | Grade 12                                                          | CCC/C                                                             | 15.751 to 99.999                                                  | GSAM managed           | Past due loans  30/uni00A0days and over   till 90 days |\n\nThe table overleaf sets out the gross loans and advances held at amortised cost, expected credit loss provis/i.rightons and expected credit loss coverage by business segment and stage. Expected credit loss coverage represents the expected credit loss reported for each segment and stage as a proportion of the gross loan balance for each segment and stage.\n\n## Stage 1\n\nStage 1 gross loans and advances to customers increased by $10 bill/i.righton, or 4 per cent compared with 31 December 2019 and represent 89 per cent of loans and advances to customers (2019: 90 per cent). The stage 1 coverage ratio remained at 0.2 per cent compared with 31 December 2019.\n\nIn Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking the proportion of stage 1 loans has reduced to 80 per cent (2019: 83 per cent), although the percentage of stage 1 loans rated as strong is higher at 58 per cent (2019: 56 per cent) as the Group continues to focus on the orig/i.rightnation of investment grade lending. Stage 1 loans reduced by $7 bill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly in the Energy, and Transport, Telecom and Util/i.rightties sector. The Central & Others segment increased by $9 bill/i.righton due to an increase in exposure to Governments.\n\nCommercial Banking stage 1 loans and advances decreased by $3.2 bill/i.righton to $20.4 bill/i.righton due to a number of corporate repayments mainly in the Greater China & North Asia region.\n\nRetail Banking stage 1 loans increased by $9 bill/i.righton primar/i.rightly driven by new lending in mortgage products. The proportion rated as strong increased to 98 per cent (2019: 97 per cent). Stage 1 Private Banking assets reduced by $1 bill/i.righton mainly in secured wealth products.\n\n## Stage 2\n\nStage 2 loans and advances to customers increased by $2 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2019, with the proportion of stage 2 loans remain/i.rightng stable at 8 per cent. This was largely due to a $3 bill/i.righton increase in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking in the Transport, Telecoms and Util/i.rightties sector. Commercial Banking stage 2 balances decreased by $0.4 bill/i.righton.\n\nRetail Banking stage 2 loans saw a decrease of $0.6 bill/i.righton primar/i.rightly in mortgage products, mainly driven by repayments and a few downgrades to stage 3.\n\nThe overall stage 2 cover ratio almost doubled to 3.3 per cent primar/i.rightly due to management overlays that were raised due to COVID-19 volatil/i.rightty and deteriorat/i.righton in macroeconomic forecasts during the year.\n\nStage 2 loans to customers classif/i.righted as 'Higher risk' increased by $0.9 bill/i.righton, with the major/i.rightty of the rise in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking following downgrades from early alerts in Africa & Middle East and ASEAN & South Asia.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nStage 3 loans and advances to customers increased by 25 per cent to $9.2 bill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $7.4 bill/i.righton), with stage 3 provis/i.rightons growing by $0.3 bill/i.righton to $5.3 bill/i.righton. As a result, the stage 3 cover ratio (excluding collateral) decreased by 10 percentage points to 58 per cent, largely driven by downgrades in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking with low levels of coverage and $1.2 bill/i.righton of write-offs, most of which were heavily provis/i.rightoned.\n\nIn Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking, gross stage 3 loans increased by $1.5 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2019, which included sign/i.rightficant but unrelated downgrades in the ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle East regions of $0.8 bill/i.righton. Provis/i.rightons rose by $0.1 bill/i.righton from $4.5 bill/i.righton to $4.6 bill/i.righton as addit/i.rightonal provis/i.rightons of $1.4 bill/i.righton were raised, but this was offset by a $1.2 bill/i.righton reduction from exposures that were repaid or written off. The cover ratio dropped by 12 percentage points to 60 per cent, of which around 5 per cent of the decrease is due to write-offs and the remain/i.rightng due to new downgrades with low level of coverage which are partially covered by credit insurance and guarantees, includ/i.rightng export credit agencies.\n\nStage 3 loans in the Retail Banking portfolio increased by $0.3 bill/i.righton driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the portfolio, but remains at 1 per cent of total Retail loans.\n\nPrivate Banking stage 3 loans remained stable at $0.4 bill/i.righton.",

        "page_content": "## Movement in gross exposures and credit impa/i.rightrment for loans and advances, debt securit/i.rightes, undrawn commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees (audited)\n\nThe tables overleaf set out the movement in gross exposures and credit impa/i.rightrment by stage in respect of amortised cost loans to banks and customers, undrawn commitments, financ/i.rightal guarantees and debt securit/i.rightes classif/i.righted at amortised cost and FVOCI. The tables are presented for the Group, debt securit/i.rightes and other elig/i.rightble bills, the Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking, Retail Banking and Commercial Banking segments.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe movement lines with/i.rightn the tables are an aggregation of monthly movements over the year and will therefore reflect the accumulation of multiple trades during the year. The credit impa/i.rightrment charge in the income statement comprises the amounts with/i.rightn the boxes in the table below less recoveries of amounts previously written off. Discount unwind is reported in net interest income and related to stage 3 financ/i.rightal instruments only.\n\nThe approach for determin/i.rightng the key line items in the tables is set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Transfers - transfers between stages are deemed to occur at the beginn/i.rightng of a month based on prior month closing balances\n- \u00b7 Net remeasurement from stage changes - the remeasurement of credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons aris/i.rightng from a change in stage is reported with/i.rightn the stage that the assets are transferred to. For example, assets transferred into stage 2 are remeasured from a 12-month to a lifet/i.rightme expected credit loss, with the effect of remeasurement reported in stage 2. For stage 3, this represents the in/i.righttial remeasurement from specif/i.rightc provis/i.rightons recognised on ind/i.rightvidual assets transferred into stage 3 in the year\n- \u00b7 Net changes in exposures - new business written less repayments in the year. With/i.rightn stage 1, new business written will attract up to 12 months of expected credit loss charges. Repayments of non-amortis/i.rightng loans (primar/i.rightly with/i.rightn Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking) will have low amounts of expected credit loss provis/i.rightons attributed to them, due to the release of provis/i.rightons over the term to maturity. In stages 2 and 3, the amounts princ/i.rightpally reflect repayments, although stage 2 may include new business written where clients are on non-purely precautionary early alert, are credit grade 12, or when non-investment grade debt securit/i.rightes are acquired.\n- \u00b7 Changes in risk parameters - for stages 1 and 2, this reflects changes in the probabil/i.rightty of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) of assets during the year, which includes the impact of releasing provis/i.rightons over the term to maturity. It also includes the effect of changes in forecasts of macroeconomic variables during the year. In stage 3, this line represents addit/i.rightonal specif/i.rightc provis/i.rightons recognised on exposures held with/i.rightn stage 3\n- \u00b7 Interest due but not paid - change in contractual amount of interest due in stage 3 financ/i.rightal instruments but not paid, being the net of accruals, repayments and write-offs, together with the corresponding change in credit impa/i.rightrment\n\nChanges to ECL models, which incorporates changes to model approaches and methodologies, is not reported as a separate line item as it has an impact over a number of lines and stages.\n\n## Movements during the period\n\nStage 1 gross exposures increased by $31 bill/i.righton to $643 bill/i.righton when compared with 31 December 2019. This was largely due to an increase of $14.7 bill/i.righton in Retail Banking, of which $10 bill/i.righton related to new mortgage lending and $4.7 bill/i.righton to credit cards and personal loans (CCPL) and other unsecured lending. Holdings of debt securit/i.rightes also increased, up by $11 bill/i.righton primar/i.rightly due to sovereign exposures. These increases were partly offset by a reduction in Commercial Banking balances, down $3.4 bill/i.righton, from a number of corporate repayments mainly in the Greater China & North Asia region. The transfers in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking reflect net outflows to stage 2 as a result of the deteriorat/i.rightng economic condit/i.rightons and an increase in customers placed on non-purely precautionary early alert and higher risk category.\n\nTotal stage 1 provis/i.rightons increased by $149 mill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly in Retail Banking, in part due to a management overlay on the unsecured portfolio for the impact of COVID-19 payment reliefs and lockdowns in the ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle East regions and provis/i.righton increases from an uptick in delinquenc/i.rightes across these markets.\n\nStage 2 gross exposures rose by $1 bill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly driven by net inflows into stage 2 in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking as clients were placed on nonpurely precautionary early alert where they were impacted by COVID-19 and flows to higher risk accounts. In Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking, stage 2 exposures increased by $4 bill/i.righton. Commercial Banking was $0.8 bill/i.righton lower as net inflows were offset by repayments. Retail Banking loans were $1 bill/i.righton lower from repayments and stage transfers in the secured mortgage portfolio. Stage 2 debt securit/i.rightes also fell $1 bill/i.righton as securit/i.rightes transferred back to stage 1 or were repaid.\n\nStage 2 provis/i.rightons rose $423 mill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2019, $346 mill/i.righton of which was in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking as a result of net transfers into stage 2 as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated, increased non-purely precautionary balances and a net $188 mill/i.righton management overlay that was recognised in 'Changes in risk parameters' in respect of COVID-19 related uncertaint/i.rightes. Retail Banking increased by $78 mill/i.righton as a result of net transfers into stage 2 due to deteriorat/i.rightng macroeconomic condit/i.rightons and a management overlay for the impact of COVID-19 payment-related reliefs in the ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle East regions, particularly in the unsecured portfolios, which form 81 per cent of total Retail provis/i.rightons.\n\nAcross all segments, the sign/i.rightficant deteriorat/i.righton in macroeconomic forecasts across all markets increased provis/i.rightons by $81 mill/i.righton.\n\nThere was a net $39 mill/i.righton release of provis/i.rightons from model changes in the year to 31 December 2020, of which Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking had a release of $48 mill/i.righton and Retail Banking had a charge of $9 mill/i.righton. Stage 3 exposures increased by $2 bill/i.righton from $8.1 bill/i.righton as at 31 December 2019 to $10.1 bill/i.righton as at 31 December 2020. This was driven by an increase of $1.4 bill/i.righton in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking clients from new downgrades during the year, which have low coverage as they are partially covered by credit insurance and guarantees, includ/i.rightng export credit agencies. Stage 3 provis/i.rightons at $5.6 bill/i.righton increased by $338 mill/i.righton from 31 December 2019. Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking provis/i.rightons increased by $115 mill/i.righton. Retail Banking provis/i.rightons increased by $195 mill/i.righton, mainly from the secured portfolio in the ASEAN & South Asia region. Across all segments, addit/i.rightonal provis/i.rightons of $1.7 bill/i.righton were offset by $1.9 bill/i.righton of write-offs.",

This may not be the same driver that caused the in/i.righttial transfer into stage 2.\n\nWhere multiple drivers apply, the exposure is allocated based on the table order. For example, a loan may have breached the PD thresholds and could also be on non-purely precautionary early alert; in this instance, the exposure is reported under 'Increase in PD'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                         | 2020                                       | 2020                                       | 2020     | 2020   | 2020                | 2020                | 2020            | 2020            | 2020     | 2020   | 2020     | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|--------|----------|--------|\n|                                         | Corporate &  Institut/i.rightonal  Banking | Corporate &  Institut/i.rightonal  Banking |          |        | Commercial  Banking | Commercial  Banking | Private Banking | Private Banking |          |        | Total    | Total  |\n|                                         | Gross  %                                   | ECL  %                                     | Gross  % | ECL  % | Gross  %            | ECL  %              | Gross  %        | ECL  %          | Gross  % | ECL  % | Gross  % | ECL  % |\n| Increase in PD                          | 62%                                        | 84%                                        | 87%      | 84%    | 61%                 | 71%                 | -

The proportion of PD driven gross inflows into stage 2 has reduced compared with 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 relief measures, which were in place for much of 2020.\n\nDebt securit/i.rightes are largely held in the Group's Treasury business in Central & Others. Debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated prior to 1 January 2018 that had a sub-investment grade rating were allocated into stage 2. For debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated after 1 January 2018, SICR is assessed based on the relative and absolute increases in PD. Central & Others has seen a sign/i.rightficant increase in the CG 12 category in 2020 primar/i.rightly due to newly downgraded sovereign counterparties in the Africa & Middle East region.\n\n'Others' primar/i.rightly incorporates exposures where orig/i.rightnation data is incomplete and the exposures are allocated into stage 2. Sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk for Private Banking clients is assessed by referencing the nature and level of collateral against which credit is extended.\n\n## Credit impa/i.rightrment charge (audited)\n\nThe underlying credit impa/i.rightrment charge is $2.3 bill/i.righton,\n\nhigher at $1.5 bill/i.righton, of which more than 60 per cent is from\n\nup $1.4 bill/i.righton compared with 2019. Stage 3 is $823 mill/i.righton\n\nCorporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking.\n\nStage 1 and stage 2 impa/i.rightrments have also increased by $565 mill/i.righton to $827 mill/i.righton (2019: $262 mill/i.righton), of which more than half of the increase is due to management overlays of $353 mill/i.righton, with the remainder due to deteriorat/i.rightng macroeconomic forecasts and stage downgrades as a result of COVID-19 related uncertaint/i.rightes.\n\nCorporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking stage 3 impa/i.rightrments were $0.9 bill/i.righton (2019: $0.4 bill/i.righton), mainly from three sign/i.rightficant but unrelated downgrades in the first quarter of 2020. Commercial Banking stage 3 impa/i.rightrment was slightly higher at $0.2 bill/i.righton (2019: $ 0.1 bill/i.righton) due to a few new client downgrades, reflecting in part the impact of the pandemic.",

A judgemental overlay of $197 mill/i.righton has also been taken, representing an estimate of the impact of further deteriorat/i.righton to the non-purely precautionary early alert portfolio.\n\nRetail stage 3 impa/i.rightrments are higher, particularly in the ASEAN & South Asia region in unsecured products as volatil/i.rightty created by the pandemic resulted in a slowdown in field collections in key markets. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment of\n\n$414 mill/i.righton was driven by higher flows into stage 2 and deteriorat/i.righton in macroeconomic forecasts, as well as a judgemental overlay of $156 mill/i.righton to account for the expected increase in delinquenc/i.rightes following the expiry of government relief measures.\n\nPrivate Banking stage 3 impa/i.rightrment charge is $4 mill/i.righton, compared with a release in 2019 driven by an ASEAN & South Asia client.

These schemes are generally in/i.righttiated by country regulators and governments. Measures include princ/i.rightpal and/or interest moratoria and term extensions, and are generally available to elig/i.rightble borrowers (those that are current or less than 30 days past due, unless local regulators have specif/i.righted different criter/i.righta). Certain schemes may be restricted to those in industr/i.rightes sign/i.rightficantly impacted by COVID-19, such as aviat/i.righton or consumer services, but are not borrower-specif/i.rightc in nature.\n\nRelief measures are generally mandated or supported by regulators and governments and are available to all elig/i.rightble customers who request it. However, in a number of countries, particularly in ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle East, compulsory (regulatory approved) moratoria reliefs are applied to all elig/i.rightble loans unless a customer has specif/i.rightcally asked to opt out.\n\nIn most major Retail Banking markets, the period of relief provided is between 6 and 12 months. In some smaller markets, reliefs are in place for 3 months.\n\nCOVID-19 related tenor extensions have also been made available to Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking clients, primar/i.rightly for periods between 3 to 9 months, if they are expected to return to normal payments with/i.rightn 12 months.\n\n## Assessment for expected credit losses\n\nCOVID-19 payment reliefs that are generally available to a market or industry as a whole and are not borrower-specif/i.rightc in nature have not, on their own, resulted in an automatic change in stage (that is, ind/i.rightvidual customers are not considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk or an improvement in credit risk) nor have they been considered to be forborne.\n\nA customer's stage and past due status reflects their status immed/i.rightately prior to the granting of the relief, with past due amounts assessed based on the new terms as set out in the temporary payment reliefs.\n\nIf a customer requires addit/i.rightonal support after the expiry of the in/i.righttial payment relief period, these will be considered at a borrower level, after taking into account their ind/i.rightvidual circumstances. Depending on the type of subsequent support provided, these customers may be classif/i.righted with/i.rightn stage 2 or stage 3.\n\nWhere client-level government guarantees are in place, these do not affect staging but are taken into account when determin/i.rightng the level of credit impa/i.rightrment.\n\n## Impact from temporary changes to loan contractual terms\n\n$3.6 bill/i.righton of outstanding loan balances are subject to payment relief measures at 31 December 2020. This represents 1 per cent of the Group's gross loans and advances to banks and customers.\n\nThe granting of COVID-19 payment-related relief measures may cause a time value of money loss for the Group where interest is not permitted to be compounded (that is, interest charged on interest) or where interest is not permitted to be charged or accrued during the relief period. As set out above, such reliefs do not impact a customer's stage and are not considered to be forborne even though a time value of money loss arises. As the relief periods are relatively short-term in nature, and a small percentage of the total loans outstanding, this has not resulted in a material impact for the Group.\n\nThe table below sets out the extent to which payment reliefs are in place across the Group's loan portfolio based on the amount outstanding at 31 December 2020.",

A large part of moratoria has ended and thus the portfolio under moratoria reduced from $8.9 bill/i.righton at its peak in the first half of the year (a sign/i.rightficant portion of which was applied to all elig/i.rightble loans and generally mandated or supported by regulators) to $2.4 bill/i.righton mainly\n\nconcentrated in Singapore and Hong Kong, which are largely secured. 16 per cent of the total amounts approved are to Business Banking customers, concentrated in industr/i.rightes that have been materially disrupted, of which over 45 per cent is collateralised by commercial immovable property.\n\nIn Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking, around 54 per cent of the amounts outstanding have a remain/i.rightng tenor of 90 days or less, and around 19 per cent of the amounts outstanding are to clients in vulnerable sectors.\n\n## COVID-19 relief measures\n\n|                                            |                              |                   | Greater China &   North Asia   | Greater China &   North Asia   | ASEAN & South Asia           | ASEAN & South Asia   | Africa & Middle East         | Africa & Middle East   | Europe & Americas            | Europe & Americas   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Segment                                    | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of  portfolio 1 | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton   | % of  portfolio 1              | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of  portfolio 1    | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of  portfolio 1      | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of  portfolio 1   |\n| Credit card &   Personal loans             | 241                          | 2%                | 23                             | 0%                             | 90                           | 0%                   | 128                          | 7%                     |                              |                     |\n| Resident/i.rightal mortgages               | 1,758                        | 2%                | 526                            | 1%                             | 1,202                        | 7%                   | 30                           | 1%                     |                              |                     |\n| Business banking                           | 373                          | 3%                | 103                            | 2%                             | 262                          | 4%                   | 8                            | 1%                     |                              |                     |\n| Total Retail Banking                       | 2,372                        | 2%                | 652                            | 1%                             | 1,554                        | 5%                   | 166                          | 3%                     |                              |                     |\n| Corporate &   Institut/i.rightonal Banking | 727                          |                   | 51                             |                                | 320                          |                      | 336                          |                        | 20                           |                     |\n| Commercial Banking                         | 468                          |                   | 262                            |                                | 113                          |                      | 93                           |                        | -

Inflows in 2020 were mainly in the ASEAN & South Asia and Africa & Middle East regions, driven by sign/i.rightficant clients across unrelated sectors downgraded in Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking.\n\nStage 3 loans in the Retail Banking portfolio increased by $0.3 bill/i.righton driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the portfolio, but remains at 1 per cent of total Retail loans.\n\nGross stage 3 loans in Private Banking remained stable at $0.4/uni00A0bill/i.righton.\n\n## Stage 3 cover ratio (audited)\n\nThe stage 3 cover ratio measures the proportion of stage 3 impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons to gross stage 3 loans, and is a metric commonly used in consider/i.rightng impa/i.rightrment trends. This metric does not allow for variat/i.rightons in the composit/i.righton of stage 3 loans and should be used in conjunct/i.righton with other Credit Risk informat/i.righton provided, includ/i.rightng the level of collateral cover.\n\nThe balance of stage 3 loans not covered by stage 3 impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons represents the adjusted value of collateral held and the net outcome of any workout or recovery strategies.\n\nCollateral provides risk mit/i.rightgation to some degree in all client segments and supports the credit quality and cover ratio assessments post impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons. Further informat/i.righton on collateral is provided in the Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation section.\n\nThe Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking cover ratio decreased by 15 percentage points to 56 per cent as a result of write-offs, debt sales and new downgrades that have low levels of coverage as they benefit from collateral. The tangible collateral cover ratio is 14 per cent lower than 2019 at 69 per cent, as new downgrades are partially covered by credit insurance and guarantees, includ/i.rightng export credit agencies which are not included in collateral cover.\n\nThe Commercial Banking cover ratio reduced to 72 per cent from 75 per cent mainly due to write-offs of heavily impa/i.rightred exposures.\n\nThe Retail Banking cover ratio increased to 49 per cent from 44 per cent.\n\nThe Private Banking cover ratio increased to 42 per cent. Private Banking clients remain highly collateralised and the cover ratio after collateral remained broadly stable at 99 per cent.\n\n|                                            | 2020                                                        | 2020                              | 2020                                 | 2020                               | 2020                   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Amortised cost                             | Corporate &  Institut/i.rightonal  Banking  $mill/i.righton | Retail   Banking  $mill/i.righton | Commercial  Banking  $mill/i.righton | Private   Banking  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Gross credit-impa/i.rightred               | 5,506                                                       | 1,173                             | 2,146                                | 389                                | 9,214                  |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons | (3,065)                                                     | (569)                             | (1,545)                              | (162)                              | (5,341)                |\n| Net credit-impa/i.rightred                 | 2,441                                                       | 604                               | 601                                  | 227                                | 3,873                  |\n| Cover ratio                                | 56%                                                         | 49%                               | 72%                                  | 42%                                | 58%                    |\n| Collateral ($ mill/i.righton)              | 737                                                         | 419                               | 326                                  | 224                                | 1,706                  |\n| Cover ratio (after collateral)             | 69%                                                         | 84%                               | 87%                                  | 99%                                | 76%                    |\n\n2019\n\n| Amortised cost                             | Corporate &  Institut/i.rightonal  Banking  $mill/i.righton   | Retail   Banking  $mill/i.righton   | Commercial  Banking  $mill/i.righton   | Private   Banking  $mill/i.righton   | Total  $mill/i.righton   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Gross credit-impa/i.rightred               | 4,173                                                         | 846                                 | 2,013                                  | 366                                  | 7, 3 9 8                 |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons | (2,980)                                                       | (374)                               | (1,503)                                | (147)                                | (5,004)                  |\n| Net credit-impa/i.rightred                 | 1,193                                                         | 472                                 | 510                                    | 219                                  | 2,394                    |\n| Cover ratio                                | 71%                                                           | 44%                                 | 75%                                    | 40%                                  | 68%                      |\n| Collateral ($ mill/i.righton)              | 497                                                           | 286                                 | 263                                    | 211                                  | 1,257                    |\n| Cover ratio (after collateral)             | 83%                                                           | 78%                                 | 88%                                    | 98%                                  | 85%                      |\n\n## Credit-impa/i.rightred (stage 3) loans and advances by geographic region\n\nStage 3 gross loans increased by $1.8 bill/i.righton or 25 per cent compared with 31 December 2019.

The extent of over-collateralisat/i.righton has been determined with reference to both the drawn and undrawn components of exposure as this best reflects the effect of collateral and other credit enhancements on the amounts aris/i.rightng from expected credit losses. The value of collateral reflects management's best estimate and is backtested against our prior experience. On average, across all types of non-cash collateral, the value ascribed is approximately half of its current market value. In the Retail Banking and Private Banking segments, a secured loan is one where the borrower pledges an asset as collateral of which the Group is able to take possession in the event that the borrower defaults.

Our underwrit/i.rightng standards encourage taking specif/i.rightc charges on assets and we consistently seek high-quality, investment grade collateral.\n\n82 per cent of tangible collateral held comprises physical assets or is property based, with the remainder largely in cash and investment securit/i.rightes.\n\nNon-tangible collateral, such as guarantees and standby letters of credit, is also held against corporate exposures, although the financ/i.rightal effect of this type of collateral is less sign/i.rightficant in terms of recoveries.

        "page_content": "## Collateral and other credit enhancements possessed or called upon (audited)\n\nThe Group obtains assets by taking possession of collateral or calling upon other credit enhancements (such as guarantees). Repossessed properties are sold in an orderly fashion. Where the proceeds are in excess of the outstanding loan balance the excess is returned to the borrower.\n\nCertain equity securit/i.rightes acquired may be held by the Group for investment purposes and are classif/i.righted as fair value through profit or loss, and the related loan written off. The carrying value of collateral possessed and held by the Group as at 31 December 2020 is $23.2 mill/i.righton (2019: $37.0 mill/i.righton).\n\n|                               | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |   2019  $mill/i.righton |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment | 18.2                    |                    29   |\n| Guarantees                    | 4.8                     |                     5.2 |\n| Cash                          | -                       |                     2.7 |\n| Other                         | 0.2                     |                     0.1 |\n| Total                         | 23.2                    |                    37   |\n\n## Other Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation (audited)\n\nOther forms of Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation are set out below.\n\n## Credit default swaps\n\nThe Group has entered into credit default swaps for portfolio management purposes, referencing loan assets with a notional value of $10.5 bill/i.righton (2019: $14.5 bill/i.righton). These credit default swaps are accounted for as financ/i.rightal guarantees as per IFRS 9 as they will only reimburse the holder for an incurred loss on an underlying debt instrument. The Group continues to hold the underlying assets referenced in the credit default swaps and it continues to be exposed to related Credit and Foreign Exchange Risk on these assets.\n\n## Credit linked notes\n\nThe Group has issued credit linked notes for portfolio management purposes, referencing loan assets with a notional value of $8.0 bill/i.righton (2019: $4.5 bill/i.righton). The Group continues to hold the underlying assets for which the credit linked notes provide mit/i.rightgation.\n\n## Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the posit/i.rightve and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivat/i.rightve transactions. These are set out in more detail under Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation (page 237).\n\n## Off-balance sheet exposures\n\nFor certain types of exposures, such as letters of credit and guarantees, the Group obtains collateral such as cash depending on internal Credit Risk assessments, as well as in the case of letters of credit holding legal title to the underlying assets should a default take place.\n\n## Other portfolio analysis\n\nThis section provides maturity analysis by business segment, credit quality by industry, and industry and retail products analysis by region.\n\n## Maturity analysis of loans and advances by client segment\n\nLoans and advances to the Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking segments remain predominantly short-term, with 61 per cent (2019: 62 per cent) maturing in less than one year. 94 per cent (2019: 97 per cent) of loans to banks mature in less than one year, a decrease compared with 2019 as net exposures reduced by $9 bill/i.righton. Shorter maturit/i.rightes give us the flexib/i.rightlity to respond promptly to events and rebalance or reduce our exposure to clients or sectors that are facing increased pressure or uncertainty.\n\nThe Private Banking loan book is mostly short-term with around 93 per cent of lending maturing in one year or less, which is typical for loans that are secured on wealth management assets.\n\nThe Retail Banking loan book continues to be longer-term in nature with 69 per cent (2019: 69 per cent) of the loans maturing over five years, as mortgages constitute the major/i.rightty of this portfolio.",

In Retail Banking, the increase is primar/i.rightly from stage 1 mortgage orig/i.rightnations in the Greater China & North Asia region.\n\nTotal wholesale stage 2 loans increased by $2 bill/i.righton largely due to an increase in loans placed on non-purely precautionary early alert, which particularly impacted the Transport, Telecom and Util/i.rightties sector. This was partly offset by reductions of $0.7 bill/i.righton in Retail Banking mainly due to repayments and few transfers to stage 3 in mortgages.\n\n|                                              |

amortised cost loan portfolio, net of provis/i.rightons, by industry and region.\n\nIn the Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking segments, our largest industry exposures are to Financ/i.rightng, insurance and non-banking, Government, and Manufacturing, with each constitut/i.rightng at least 15 per cent of Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking loans and advances to customers.\n\nFinanc/i.rightng, insurance and non-banking industry clients are mostly investment grade inst/i.righttutions and this lending forms part of the liqu/i.rightdity management of the Group. The manufacturing sector group is spread across a diverse range of industr/i.rightes, includ/i.rightng automobiles and components, capital goods, pharmaceuticals, biotech and life sciences, technology hardware and equipment, chemicals, paper products and packaging, with lending spread over 4,100 clients.\n\nLoans and advances to the energy sector reduced to 8 per cent (2019: 10 per cent) of total loans and advances to Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking. The Energy sector lending is spread across five sub-sectors and over 230 clients.\n\nThe Group provides loans to commercial real estate counterparties of $19 bill/i.righton, which represent 7 per cent of total customer loans and advances. In total, $8.8 bill/i.righton of this lending is to counterparties where the source of repayment is substantially derived from rental or sale of real estate and is secured by real estate collateral. The remain/i.rightng commercial real estate loans comprise working capital loans to real estate corporates, loans with non-property collateral, unsecured loans and loans to real estate entit/i.rightes of divers/i.rightfied conglomerates. The average LTV ratio of the commercial real estate portfolio has increased to 51 per cent, compared with 46 per cent in 2019. The proportion of loans with an LTV greater than 80 per cent has increased to 4 per cent in 2020, compared with 1 per cent in 2019.\n\nThe mortgages portfolio continues to be the largest portion of the Retail Products portfolio, at 66 per cent (2019: 65 per cent). CCPL and other unsecured lending has reduced to 13 per cent of total Retail Products loans and advances (2019: 14 per cent).",

The reductions were largely due to increased levels of collateral and reduced undrawn commitments, particularly in the Commodity traders, Metals & min/i.rightng, and Commercial real estate sectors.\n\nStage 2 loans increased to 18 per cent (2019: 13 per cent) of loans to vulnerable sectors. This was primar/i.rightly driven by an increase in loans placed on non-purely precautionary early alert in the Aviat/i.righton and Commercial real estate sectors, offset by Commodity traders sector clients, some of which were transferred to stage 3.\n\nStage 3 loans increased by $0.6 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2019 primar/i.rightly due to downgrades from stage 2 exposures in the Commodity traders and Aviat/i.righton sectors due to COVID-19 related volatil/i.rightty.\n\n## Maximum exposure\n\n|                                                                        | 2020

Debt securit/i.rightes held that have a short-term rating are reported against the long-term rating of the issuer. For securit/i.rightes that are unrated, the Group applies an internal credit rating, as described under the credit rating and measurement section (page 255).\n\nTotal debt securit/i.rightes and other elig/i.rightble bills increased by $9.4 bill/i.righton as part of the Group's liqu/i.rightdity management to meet regulatory requirement and to support the Group's strategy to provide more credit solutions to customers.\n\nAs the total balance sheet increased, excess funding from customers was deployed in highly rated securit/i.rightes to boost holdings of high-quality liqu/i.rightd assets. This can be observed in the increase of stage 1 securit/i.rightes rated A- and above of $10.9 bill/i.righton. Investment in stage 1 unrated securit/i.rightes decreased by $2.9 bill/i.righton as matured securit/i.rightes were not rolled over and funding channelled to investment in rated securit/i.rightes. Stage 2 securit/i.rightes decreased by $1.1 bill/i.righton mainly due to balances transferred to stage 1 as a result of improved credit quality.",

However, for some of the key countries, country-specif/i.rightc models have also been developed.\n\nThe calibrat/i.righton of forward-looking informat/i.righton is assessed at a country or region level to take into account local macroeconomic condit/i.rightons.\n\nRetail Banking expected credit loss models are country and product specif/i.rightc given the local nature of the Retail Banking business.\n\nFor less material Retail Banking portfolios, the Group has adopted less sophist/i.rightcated approaches based on histor/i.rightcal roll rates or loss rates:\n\n- \u00b7 For medium-sized Retail Banking portfolios, a roll rate model is applied, which uses a matrix that gives the average loan migrat/i.righton rate between delinquency states from period to period. A matrix multipl/i.rightcation is then performed to generate the final PDs by delinquency bucket over different time horizons.\n- \u00b7 For smaller Retail Banking portfolios, loss rate models are applied. These use an adjusted gross charge-off rate, developed using monthly write-off and recoveries over the preceding 12 months and total outstanding balances.\n- \u00b7 While these models do not incorporate forward-looking informat/i.righton, to the extent that there are sign/i.rightficant changes in the macroeconomic forecasts an assessment will be completed on whether an adjustment to the modelled output is required.\n\nFor a lim/i.rightted number of exposures, proxy parameters or approaches are used where the data is not available to calculate the orig/i.rightnation PDs for the purpose of applying the SICR criter/i.righta; or for some retail portfolios where a full history of LGD data is not available, estimates based on the loss experience from sim/i.rightlar portfolios are used. The use of proxies is monitored and will reduce over time.\n\nThe following processes are in place to assess the ongoing performance of the models:\n\n- \u00b7 Quarterly model monitor/i.rightng that uses recent data to compare the differences between model predict/i.rightons and actual outcomes against approved thresholds.\n- \u00b7 Annual independent validat/i.rightons of the performance of material models by Group Model Validat/i.righton (GMV); an abridged validat/i.righton is completed for non-material models.\n\n## Applicat/i.righton of lifet/i.rightme\n\nExpected credit loss is estimated based on the period over which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk. For the major/i.rightty of exposures this equates to the maximum contractual period. For Retail Banking credit cards and Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking overdraft facil/i.rightties however, the Group does not typically enforce the contractual period, which can be as short as one day. As a result, the period over which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk for these instruments reflects their behavioural life, which incorporates expectations of customer behaviour and the extent to which Credit Risk management actions curtail the period of that exposure. The average behavioural life for Retail Banking credit cards is between 3 and 6 years across our footprint markets.\n\nIn 2020, the behavioural life for corporate overdraft facil/i.rightties was re-estimated using recent data, and a lifet/i.rightme of 24 months is now being applied (2019: 32 months). The change in approach does not have a material impact on the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Post model adjustments\n\nWhere a model's performance breaches the monitor/i.rightng thresholds or validat/i.righton standards, an assessment is completed to determine whether an ECL Post Model Adjustment (PMA) is required to correct for the ident/i.rightfied model issue. PMAs will be removed when the models are updated to correct for the ident/i.rightfied model issue or the estimates return to being with/i.rightn the monitor/i.rightng thresholds.\n\nThe unprecedented volatil/i.rightty in the quarterly macroeconomic forecasts seen over 2020 has meant that a number of the Group's IFRS 9 ECL models are now operating outside the boundaries to which they were calibrated. Over the COVID-19 period we have commonly seen GDP decreases over a single quarter of/uni00A0around 10 to 20 per cent while a country is in lock down, followed by a recovery of 10 to 20 per cent the following quarter when the lock down is assumed to end. This can lead to the models in some instances either seeing a very large economic deteriorat/i.righton or a very optim/i.rightstic GDP increase (i.e./uni00A0if/uni00A0the model only uses the period in the scenario with the recovery). In these cases, this causes a sudden PD increase or\n\ndecrease, which will then return to more normal levels once the volatil/i.rightty in the quarterly forecasts returns to histor/i.rightcal norms. As a result, at 31 December 2020 the Group has made adjustments to the modelled output to remove this volatil/i.rightty to ensure that the resulting ECL remains unbiased and appropriately reflects the Group's credit risks in the current environment. The adjustments are based on a combinat/i.righton of portfolio-level Credit Risk analysis (retail) and an evaluation of ECL coverage at an exposure level (wholesale). These adjustments will be removed once the quarterly macroeconomic forecasts and associated model estimates become less volatile in line with histor/i.rightcal norms.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, PMAs have been applied for 13 models out of the total of 186. In aggregate, the PMAs decrease the Group's impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons by $158 mill/i.righton (9 per cent of modelled provis/i.rightons) compared with a $13 mill/i.righton decrease at 31 December 2019. As set out on page 228, a separate management overlay that covers risk not captured by the models has been applied after taking into account these PMAs.\n\n|                                                                                   | 2020   $m   | 2019   $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Volatil/i.rightty-related PMAs                                                    |             |             |\n| Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking, Commercial Banking and Central & Others | (49)        | -           |\n| Retail Banking                                                                    | (12)        | -           |\n|                                                                                   | (61)        | -           |\n| Model performance PMAs                                                            |             |             |\n| Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking                   | (73)        | -           |\n| Retail Banking                                                                    | (24)        | (13)        |\n|                                                                                   | (97)        | (13)        |\n| Total PMAs                                                                        | (158)       | (13)        |\n\n## Key assumptions and judgements in determin/i.rightng expected credit loss\n\n## Incorporation of forward-looking informat/i.righton\n\nThe evolving economic environment is a key determinant of the abil/i.rightty of a bank's clients to meet their obligat/i.rightons as they fall due. It is a fundamental princ/i.rightple of IFRS 9 that the provis/i.rightons banks hold against potential future Credit Risk losses should depend not just on the health of the economy today but should also take into account potential changes to the economic environment. For example, if a bank were to antic/i.rightpate a sharp slowdown in the world economy over the coming year, it should hold more provis/i.rightons today to absorb the credit losses likely to occur in the near future.\n\nTo capture the effect of changes to the economic environment, the PDs and LGDs used to calculate ECL incorporate forward-looking informat/i.righton in the form of forecasts of the values of economic variables and asset prices that are likely to have an effect on the repayment abil/i.rightty of the Group's clients.\n\nThe 'Base Forecast' of the economic variables and asset prices is based on management's view on the five-year outlook, supported by project/i.rightons from the Group's in-house research team and outputs from a third-party model that project specif/i.rightc economic variables and asset prices. The research team takes consensus views into considerat/i.righton and senior management review project/i.rightons for some core country variables against consensus when forming their view of the outlook. For the period beyond five years, management util/i.rightses the in-house research view and third-party model outputs, which allow for a reversion to long-term growth rates or norms. All project/i.rightons are updated on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Forecast of key macroeconomic variables underlying the expected credit loss calculation and the impact on non-linear/i.rightty\n\nThe Base Forecast - management's view of the most likely outcome - is that the prospects for a path out of the COVID-19 cris/i.rights have improved with progress on vaccines and virus treatments. Early into the new year, this has raised confidence over the economic outlook and is expected to support the recovery of economic activ/i.rightty over the next two years. Global GDP is expected to grow by around 5 per cent in 2021, well above the average of 3.7 per cent for the ten years between 2010 to 2019. However, this follows a contraction of almost 4 per cent in 2020, the worst performance since the Great Depression of 1929-31.\n\nKey to the outlook is the assumption that vaccines will be rolled out early in 2021 in major markets, and reach the major/i.rightty of the population by the third quarter of the year. In addit/i.righton, renewed virus outbreaks in many countries are expected to be contained. The global economic recovery will strengthen in the second half of 2021 as investment picks up around the world.\n\nWith the global recovery under way, many countries are expected to be close to their forward-looking long-term or future potential - growth levels by the end of the next two years. However, the outlook remains highly uncertain. A faster distr/i.rightbution of vaccines will likely support stronger growth, while delays and disrupt/i.rightons will hold it back. The current (and any future) resurgence of the virus in many countries could also force governments to tighten restrict/i.rightons on economic activ/i.rightty for longer than antic/i.rightpated.",

        "page_content": "While the quarterly base forecasts inform the Group's strategic plan, one key requirement of IFRS 9 is that the assessment of provis/i.rightons should consider multiple future economic environments. For example, the global economy may grow more quickly or more slowly than the Base Forecast, and these variat/i.rightons would have different impl/i.rightcations for the provis/i.rightons that the Group should hold today. As the negative impact of an economic downturn on credit losses tends to be greater than the posit/i.rightve impact of an economic upturn, if the Group sets provis/i.rightons only on the ECL under the Base Forecast it might mainta/i.rightn a level of provis/i.rightons that does not appropriately capture the range of potential outcomes. To address this property of skewness (or non-linear/i.rightty), IFRS 9 requires reported ECL to be a probabil/i.rightty-weighted ECL calculated over a range of possible outcomes.\n\nTo assess the range of possible outcomes, the Group simulates a set of 50 scenarios around the Base Forecast, calculates the ECL under each of them and assigns an equal weight of 2 per cent to each scenario outcome. These scenarios are generated by a Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton, which addresses the challenges of crafting many realist/i.rightc alternative scenarios in the many countries in which the Group operates by means of a model, which produces these alternative scenarios while consider/i.rightng the degree of histor/i.rightcal uncertainty (or volatil/i.rightty) observed over 1Q'90 to 3Q'20 around economic outcomes and how these outcomes have tended to move in relation to one another (or correlation). This naturally means that each of the 50 scenarios do not have a specif/i.rightc narrative, although collectively they explore a range of hypothetical alternative outcomes for the global economy, includ/i.rightng scenarios that turn out better than expected and scenarios that amplify antic/i.rightpated stresses.\n\n## China GDP YoY%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Singapore GDP YoY%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table on page 227 provides a summary of the Group's Base Forecast for key footprint markets, alongside the corresponding range seen across the multiple scenarios. The peak/trough amounts in the table show the highest and lowest points with/i.rightn the Base Forecast, and the GDP graphs below illustrate the shape of the Base Forecast in relation to prior periods' actuals and the long-term growth rates.\n\nThe global economic recovery in the near term is expected to be uneven. While the US and Europe are likely to recover this year, Asia - particularly China and India - is expected to lead the global economic rebound. China is likely to continue its strong recovery and is expected to grow by 8 per cent in 2021, having already exceeded end-2019 GDP levels in 2020. Among Asian economies, India has faced the sharpest negative shock, with an expected GDP contraction of around 8 per cent in FY21 (year ending in March 2021). The expected pick-up in FY22 is around 10 per cent. Open economies that are reliant on trade such as Singapore will be lifted by the global economic recovery. Its GDP is expected to grow by around 5 per cent after a 6 per cent contraction in 2020. Sim/i.rightlarly, Hong Kong's economy is expected to expand by 4 per cent this year from a 6 per cent contraction previously. Korea was one of the first countries to be affected by the pandemic, but the effective strategies employed by the government helped contain the spread of the virus and lim/i.rightted the economic fallout compared with other advanced economies. Korea's GDP is expected to grow by 3.3 per cent in 2021 after contracting by less than 1 per cent in 2020.\n\nGains in commodity prices are also likely to be uneven. Metal prices such as copper are expected to benefit from the improved outlook for Asia, particularly China. However, global oil demand is not expected to recover all of its 2020 losses this year and this will lim/i.rightt any price gains. Oil prices are expected to average $44 in 2021, showing only a marginal gain from the $41 average in 2020. However, there are upside risks to oil prices should the economic recovery be stronger than expected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## India GDP YoY%\n\nLong-term growth = forward-looking future GDP growth potential\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Management overlay - COVID-19\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group held a $359 mill/i.righton management overlay relating to uncertaint/i.rightes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not captured by the models, $197 mill/i.righton of which relates to Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking and $162 mill/i.righton to Retail Banking. The overlay has been determined after taking account of the PMAs reported on page 225 and is re-assessed quarterly. It is reviewed and approved by the IFRS9 Impairment Committee.\n\nCorporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking The amount of loans placed on non-purely precautionary early alert increased sign/i.rightficantly over 2020 as the impact of COVID-19 was evaluated on the Group's portfolio. However, the impact of the rapid deteriorat/i.righton in the economic environment in 2020 has not yet been fully observed in customers' financ/i.rightal performance. In part this has been due to ongoing government support measures across the Group's markets and we have not yet seen a sign/i.rightficant increase in the level of stage 3 loans relating to COVID-19 as at 31 December 2020. To take account of the heightened Credit Risk and the continu/i.rightng uncertaint/i.rightes in the pace and tim/i.rightng of economic recovery, a judgemental overlay has been taken by estimat/i.rightng the impact of further deteriorat/i.righton to the non-purely precautionary early alert portfolio. The overlay is held in stage 2. The basis of determin/i.rightng the overlay remained unchanged during 2020. The overlay increased to $227 mill/i.righton at 30 September 2020 compared with $198 mill/i.righton at 30 June 2020, and reduced to $197 mill/i.righton at 31 December 2020 as the level of non-purely precautionary early alerts reduced relative to previous quarters.\n\nRetail Banking A number of components contribute to the judgemental overlay for Retail Banking. With/i.rightn Business Banking, the Group has evaluated those sectors that have been adversely impacted by COVID-19, both through internal credit processes as well as through a 'Voice of Customer' survey to understand how customers have been affected. The Group has also considered the extent to which lockdowns have impacted collections and recoveries, and the extent to which payment reliefs may mask underlying credit risks, particularly in those markets in ASEAN & South Asia where compulsory moratoria schemes were in place. For those markets, the Group has estimated the impact of increased delinquenc/i.rightes and flows to defaults when the moratoria are lifted as well as the extent to which customers in stage 1 may have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk if not for the moratoria. The Group assessment also considered employee banking relationsh/i.rightps with high-impact sectors, such as airl/i.rightnes, and the impact on mortgages in Africa & Middle East which generally have high LTVs. $78 mill/i.righton of the overlay is held in stage 1, $78 mill/i.righton in stage 2 and $6 mill/i.righton in stage 3. The basis of determin/i.rightng the overlay remained unchanged during 2020. The overlay increased to $166 mill/i.righton at 30 September compared with $118m at 30 June 2020 and reduced to $162 mill/i.righton at 31 December 2020, as general moratoria schemes ended in a number of markets and the increased delinquency flows were captured by the ECL models.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nCredit-impa/i.rightred assets managed by Group Special Assets Management (GSAM) incorporate forward-looking economic assumptions in respect of the recovery outcomes ident/i.rightfied, and are assigned ind/i.rightvidual probabil/i.rightty weight/i.rightngs. These assumptions are not based on a Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton but are informed by the Base Forecast.\n\n## Sensit/i.rightvity of expected credit loss calculation to macroeconomic variables\n\ninherently non-linear and portfolio-dependent, which impl/i.rightes that no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensit/i.rightvity of the ECL to changes in the macroeconomic variables. The Group has conducted a series of analyses with the aim of ident/i.rightfying the macroeconomic variables that might have the greatest impact on overall ECL. These encompassed single variable and multi-variable exercises, using simple up/ down variat/i.righton and extracts from actual calculation data, as well as bespoke scenario design and assessments. The primary conclusion of these exercises is that no ind/i.rightvidual macroeconomic variable is materially influent/i.rightal. The Group believes this is plausible as the number of variables used in the ECL calculation is large. This does not mean that macroeconomic variables are uninfluent/i.rightal; rather, that the Group believes that considerat/i.righton of macroeconomics should involve whole scenarios, as this aligns with the multi-variable nature of the calculation.\n\nThe ECL calculation relies on multiple variables and is\n\nThe Group faces downside risks in the operating environment related to the uncertaint/i.rightes surrounding the effect of COVID-19 on the macroeconomic outlook. To explore this, a sensit/i.rightvity analysis of ECL was undertaken to explore the effect of slower economic recoveries across the Group's footprint markets. Two downside scenarios were considered, with both assuming a second wave of COVID-19 early in 2021 across all Standard Chartered markets. The shock is assumed to be 50 per cent as severe as the first wave as governments have learnt lessons on how to tackle the spread of the virus from the prior years' experience. In the moderate scenario, a reasonable recovery takes hold in the second half of 2021. In the severe scenario measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and stimulate activ/i.rightty prove insuff/i.rightcient and the economies are stuck in a prolonged slowdown with a recovery not material/i.rightsing until 2022.",

Note that these scenarios are not incorporated into the Group's determinat/i.righton of ECL provis/i.rightons and the actual outcome of any scenario may be materially different due to, amongst other factors, the effect of management actions to mit/i.rightgate potential increases in risk and changes in the underlying portfolio.\n\n## Modelled provis/i.rightons\n\n|                                          |   Moderate  downside  increase   $m | Severe   downside  increase   $m   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking |                                  75 | 890                                |\n| Retail Banking                           |                                  79 | 175                                |\n| Commercial Banking                       |                                  50 | 237                                |\n| Private Banking                          |                                   1 | 1                                  |\n| Central & other items                    |                                  37 | 45                                 |\n| Total                                    |                                 242 | 1,348                              |\n\n## Proportion of assets in stage 2 1\n\n|                                          | Base   Forecast   scenario   %   | Moderate  downside  scenario   %   | Severe   downside  scenario   %   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking | 10.9%                            | 11.6%                              | 25.9%                             |\n| Retail Banking                           | 2.1%                             | 2.5%                               | 2.9%                              |\n| Commercial Banking                       | 1 7. 2 %                         | 23.4%                              | 45.5%                             |\n| Private Banking                          | 7. 2 %                           | 7. 2 %                             | 7. 2 %                            |\n| Central & other items                    | 0.6%                             | 0.9%                               | 2.7%                              |\n| Total                                    | 5.7%                             | 6.5%                               | 13.5%                             |",

        "page_content": "## Sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk (SICR) Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nSICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date to the risk of default at orig/i.rightnation. Whether a change in the risk of default is sign/i.rightficant or not is assessed using quantitat/i.rightve and qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta. These quantitat/i.rightve sign/i.rightficant deteriorat/i.righton thresholds have been separately defined for each business and where meaningful are consistently applied across business lines.\n\nAssets are considered to have experienced SICR if they have breached both relative and absolute thresholds for the change in the average annualised lifet/i.rightme probabil/i.rightty of default over the residual term of the exposure.\n\nThe absolute measure of increase in credit risk is used to capture instances where the PDs on exposures are relatively low at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton as these may increase by several multiples without representing a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk. Where PDs are relatively high at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, a relative measure is more appropriate in assessing whether there is a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk, as the PDs increase more quickly.\n\nThe SICR thresholds have been calibrated based on the following princ/i.rightples:\n\n- \u00b7 Stabil/i.rightty - The thresholds are set to achieve a stable stage 2 population at a portfolio level, trying to min/i.rightmise the number of accounts moving back and forth between stage 1 and stage 2 in a short period of time\n- \u00b7 Accuracy - The thresholds are set such that there is a materially higher propensity for stage 2 exposures to eventually default than is the case for stage 1 exposures\n- \u00b7 Dependency from backstops - The thresholds are stringent enough such that a high proportion of accounts transfer to stage 2 due to movements in forward-looking PD rather than relying on backward-looking backstops such as arrears\n- \u00b7 Relationsh/i.rightp with business and product risk profiles The thresholds reflect the relative risk differences between different products, and are aligned to business processes\n\nFor Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking clients, the relative threshold is a 100 per cent increase in PD and the absolute change in PD is between 50 and 100 bps.\n\nFor Retail Banking clients, the relative threshold is a 100 per cent increase in PD and the absolute change in PD is between 100 and 350 bps depending on the product. Certain countries have a higher absolute threshold reflecting the lower default rate with/i.rightn their personal loan portfolios compared with the Group's other personal loan portfolios.\n\nPrivate Banking clients are assessed qualitat/i.rightvely, based on a delinquency measure relating to collateral top-ups or sell-downs.\n\nDebt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated before 1 January 2018, with an internal credit rating mapped to an investment grade equivalent, are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt securit/i.rightes to stage 2. Debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated after 1 January 2018 apply the same approach and thresholds as for Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking clients.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nQualitat/i.rightve factors that ind/i.rightcate there has been a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk include processes linked to current risk management, such as placing loans on non-purely precautionary early alert.\n\n## Backstop\n\nAcross all portfolios, accounts that are 30 or more days past due (DPD) on contractual payments of princ/i.rightpal and/or interest that have not been captured by the criter/i.righta above are considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk.\n\nExpert credit judgement may be applied in assessing sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk to the extent that certain risks may not have been captured by the models or through the above criter/i.righta. Such instances are expected to be rare, for example due to events and material uncertaint/i.rightes aris/i.rightng close to the reporting date.\n\n## Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking clients\n\n## Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nExposures are assessed based on both the absolute and the relative movement in the PD from orig/i.rightnation to the reporting date as described above.\n\nTo account for the fact that the mapping between internal credit grades (used in the orig/i.rightnation process) and PDs is non-linear (e.g. a one-notch downgrade in the investment grade universe results in a much smaller PD increase than in the sub-investment grade universe), the absolute thresholds have been different/i.rightated by credit quality at orig/i.rightnation, as measured by internal credit grades being investment grade or sub-investment grade.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nAll assets of clients that have been placed on early alert (for non-purely precautionary reasons) are deemed to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk.\n\nAn account is placed on non-purely precautionary early alert if it exhib/i.rightts risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requir/i.rightng closer monitor/i.rightng, supervis/i.righton or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deteriorat/i.righton of repayment prospects and the likel/i.righthood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of posit/i.righton with/i.rightn the industry, concerns over management's abil/i.rightty to manage operations, weak/deteriorat/i.rightng operating results, liqu/i.rightdity strain and overdue balances, among other factors.\n\nAll client assets that have been assigned a CG12 rating, equivalent to 'Higher risk', are deemed to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk. Accounts rated CG12 are managed by the GSAM unit. All Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking clients are placed on CG12 when they are 30 DPD unless they are granted a waiver through a strict governance process.\n\n## Retail Banking clients\n\n## Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nMaterial portfolios (defined as a combinat/i.righton of country and product, for example Hong Kong mortgages, Taiwan credit cards) for which a statist/i.rightcal model has been built, are assessed based on both the absolute and relative movement in the PD from orig/i.rightnation to the reporting date as described above. For these portfolios, the orig/i.rightnal lifet/i.rightme PD term structure is determined based on the orig/i.rightnal applicat/i.righton score or risk segment of the client.",

For less material portfolios, which are modelled based on a roll-rate or loss-rate approach, SICR is primar/i.rightly assessed through the 30 DPD trigger.\n\n## Private Banking clients\n\nFor Private Banking clients, SICR is assessed by referencing the nature and the level of collateral against which credit is extended (known as 'Classes of Risk').\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nFor all Private Banking classes, in line with risk management practice, an increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred where margin/i.rightng or loan-to-value covenants have been breached.\n\nFor Class I assets (lending against divers/i.rightfied liqu/i.rightd collateral), if these margin/i.rightng requirements have not been met with/i.rightn 30 days of a trigger, a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk is assumed to have occurred.\n\nFor Class I and Class III assets (real-estate lending), a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk is assumed to have occurred where the bank is unable to 'sell down' the applicable assets to meet revised collateral requirements with/i.rightn five days of a trigger.\n\nClass II assets are typically unsecured or partially secured, or secured against ill/i.rightquid collateral such as shares in private companies. Sign/i.rightficant credit deteriorat/i.righton of these assets is deemed to have occurred when any early alert trigger has been breached.\n\n## Debt securit/i.rightes\n\n## Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nFor debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated before 1 January 2018, the bank is util/i.rightsing the low Credit Risk simpl/i.rightfied approach, where debt securit/i.rightes with an internal credit rating mapped to an investment grade equivalent are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt securit/i.rightes are allocated to stage 2. Debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated after 1 January 2018 are assessed based on the absolute and relative movements in PD from orig/i.rightnation to the reporting date.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nDebt securit/i.rightes util/i.rightse the same qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta as the Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking client segments, includ/i.rightng being placed on early alert or being classif/i.righted as CG12.\n\n## Assessment of credit-impa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal assets\n\n## Retail Banking clients\n\nThe core components in determin/i.rightng credit-impa/i.rightred expected credit loss provis/i.rightons are the value of gross chargeoff and recoveries. Gross charge-off and/or loss provis/i.rightons are recognised when it is established that the account is unlikely to pay through the normal process. Recovery of unsecured debt post credit impa/i.rightrment is recognised based on actual cash collected, either directly from clients or through the sale of defaulted loans to third-party inst/i.righttutions. Release of credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons for secured loans is recognised if the loan outstanding is paid in full (release of full provis/i.righton), or the provis/i.righton is higher than the loan outstanding (release of the excess provis/i.righton).\n\n## Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking, Commercial Banking and Private Banking clients\n\nCredit-impa/i.rightred accounts are managed by the Group's special/i.rightst recovery unit, Group Special Assets Management (GSAM), which is independent from its main businesses. Where any amount is considered irrecoverable, a stage 3 credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.righton is raised. This stage 3 provis/i.righton is the difference between the loan-carrying amount and the probabil/i.rightty-weighted present value of estimated future cashflows, reflecting a range of scenarios (typically the best, worst and most likely recovery outcomes). Where the cashflows include realisable collateral, the values used will incorporate the impact of forward-looking economic informat/i.righton.\n\nThe ind/i.rightvidual circumstances of each client are considered when GSAM estimates future cashflows and the tim/i.rightng of future recoveries which involves sign/i.rightficant judgement. All available sources, such as cashflow aris/i.rightng from operations, selling assets or subsid/i.rightaries, realis/i.rightng collateral or payments under guarantees are considered. In any decis/i.righton relating to the rais/i.rightng of provis/i.rightons, the Group attempts to balance economic condit/i.rightons, local knowledge and experience, and the results of independent asset reviews.\n\n## Write-offs\n\nWhere it is considered that there is no realist/i.rightc prospect of recovering a portion of an exposure against which an impa/i.rightrment provis/i.righton has been raised, that amount will be written off.\n\n## Governance and applicat/i.righton of expert credit judgement in respect of expected credit losses\n\nThe Group's Credit Policy and Standards framework details the requirements for continuous monitor/i.rightng to ident/i.rightfy any changes in credit quality and resultant ratings, as well as ensuring a consistent approach to monitor/i.rightng, managing and mit/i.rightgating credit risks. The framework aligns with the governance of ECL estimat/i.righton through the early recognit/i.righton of sign/i.rightficant deteriorat/i.rightons in ratings which drive stage 2 and 3 ECL.\n\nThe models used in determin/i.rightng expected credit losses are reviewed and approved by the Group Credit Model Assessment Committee (CMAC) which is appointed by the Model Risk Committee. CMAC has the responsib/i.rightlity to assess and approve the use of models and to review all IFRS 9 interpretat/i.rightons related to models. CMAC also provides oversight on operational matters related to model development, performance monitor/i.rightng and model validat/i.righton activ/i.rightties includ/i.rightng standards, regulatory and Group Internal Audit matters.\n\nPrior to submiss/i.righton to CMAC for approval, the models are validated by Group Model Validat/i.righton (GMV), a function which is independent of the business and the model developers. GMV's analysis comprises review of model documentation, model design and methodology, data validat/i.righton, review of the model development and calibrat/i.righton process, out-ofsample performance testing, and assessment of compliance review against IFRS 9 rules and internal standards.\n\nA quarterly model monitor/i.rightng process is in place that uses recent data to compare the differences between model predict/i.rightons and actual outcomes against approved thresholds. Where a model's performance breaches the monitor/i.rightng thresholds, an assessment of whether a PMA is required to correct for the ident/i.rightfied model issue is completed.",

Changes in the pace of economic activ/i.rightty and portfolio management activ/i.rightty had an impact on the growth of Country Risk exposure for certain markets.\n\nThere has been an increase in exposure to the United States, driven by increased nostros balances kept with the Federal Reserve and growth in domestic short-term lending, particularly to non-financ/i.rightal corporations.\n\nThere has been a slight increase in exposure to Hong Kong, primar/i.rightly due to increased nostros balances kept with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. This was partially offset by reduced domestic treasury market activ/i.rightties.\n\nExposure to South Korea increased due to growth in the retail portfolio combined with increased domestic treasury market activ/i.rightty.\n\nExposure to China increased due to growth in cross-border treasury market volumes and higher nostros balances. This was partially offset by a reduction in cross-border trade finance activ/i.rightty.\n\nThe increase in exposure to Singapore is due to higher nostros balances kept with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and increased cross-border lending to financ/i.rightal inst/i.righttutions.\n\nUnited Kingdom exposure increased due to higher nostros balances kept with the Bank of England. This was partially offset by reduced cross-border trade finance activ/i.rightty.\n\nExposure to India increased slightly, with increased domestic treasury market activ/i.rightties offsetting the reductions in the retail and private banking portfolios.\n\nThe increase in exposure to Taiwan is driven by higher nostros balances and increased cross-border lending, particularly to non-financ/i.rightal corporations.\n\nExposure to Germany increased due to increased term loans and higher nostros balances. This was partially offset by a reduction in government bond holdings.\n\nExposure to the UAE decreased due to lower domestic treasury market activ/i.rightty and a reduction in the retail portfolio.\n\nThe table below, which is based on the Group's internal Country Risk reporting requirements shows the 10 largest country/market exposures across the Group.\n\n|                      | 2020                  | 2020                  | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2019                  | 2019                  |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Country/Market       | TCR   $mill/i.righton | LCR   $mill/i.righton | GCR   $mill/i.righton | TCR   $mill/i.righton | LCR   $mill/i.righton | GCR   $mill/i.righton |\n| United States        | 32,677                | 63,355                | 96,032                | 25,966                | 58,930                | 84,896                |\n| Hong Kong            | 19,113                | 67, 6 5 5             | 86,768                | 21,361                | 63,214                | 84,575                |\n| South Korea          | 15,526                | 59,089                | 74,615                | 1 7, 8 0 9            | 49,351                | 67,1 6 0              |\n| China                | 42,661                | 21,838                | 64,499                | 36,469                | 20,977                | 5 7, 4 4 6            |\n| Singapore            | 20,113                | 39,145                | 59,258                | 18,304                | 34,046                | 52,350                |\n| United Kingdom       | 20,887                | 26,207                | 47,094                | 27,563                | 16,782                | 44,345                |\n| India                | 13,713                | 21,388                | 35,101                | 14,008                | 20,305                | 34,313                |\n| Taiwan               | 6,732                 | 1 7, 2 9 2            | 24,024                | 2,733                 | 14,827                | 1 7, 5 6 0            |\n| Germany              | 14,323                | 7,9 1 0               | 22,233                | 11,890                | 4,546                 | 16,436                |\n| United Arab Emirates | 15,807                | 5,714                 | 21,521                | 16,461                | 6,145                 | 22,606                |\n\n## Traded Risk\n\nTraded Risk is the potential for loss resulting from activ/i.rightties undertaken by the Group in financ/i.rightal markets. Under the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the Traded Risk Framework brings together Market Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk, Issuer Risk, XVA, Algorithm/i.rightc Trading and Pension Risk. Traded Risk Management is the core risk management function supporting market-facing businesses, predominantly Financ/i.rightal Markets and Treasury Markets.\n\n## Market Risk (audited)\n\nMarket Risk is the potential for loss of economic value due to adverse changes in financ/i.rightal market rates or prices. The Group's exposure to Market Risk arises predominantly from the following sources:\n\n## \u00b7 Trading book:\n\n- -  The Group provides clients access to financ/i.rightal markets, facil/i.righttation of which entails the Group taking moderate Market Risk posit/i.rightons. All trading teams support client activ/i.rightty. There are no proprietary trading teams. Hence, income earned from Market Risk-related activ/i.rightties is primar/i.rightly driven by the volume of client activ/i.rightty rather than risk-taking\n\n## \u00b7 Non-trading book:\n\n- -  The Treasury Markets desk is required to hold a liqu/i.rightd assets buffer, much of which is held in high-quality marketable debt securit/i.rightes\n- -  The Group has capital invested and related income streams denominated in currencies other than US dollars. To the extent that these are not hedged, the Group is subject to Structural Foreign Exchange Risk which is reflected in reserves\n\nA summary of our current polic/i.rightes and practices regarding Market Risk management is provided in the Princ/i.rightpal Risks section (page 257).",

The actual level of total trading and non-trading VaR as at the end of 2020 was $137.6 mill/i.righton, 300 per cent higher than in 2019 ($34.4 mill/i.righton). The increase in total average VaR was driven by the extreme market volatil/i.rightty in interest rates and credit spreads following the outbreak of COVID-19 and the collapse in oil prices, with the largest increase observed in the non-trading book from high-quality marketable securit/i.rightes held in the Treasury Markets liqu/i.rightd assets buffer. The credit bonds that are included in the buffer are almost exclusively of investment grade. The histor/i.rightcal scenarios driv/i.rightng the total VaR are all from March 2020, hence VaR is expected to remain elevated until at least March 2021.\n\nFor the trading book, the average level of VaR in 2020 was $17.0 mill/i.righton, 55 per cent higher than in 2019 ($11.0 mill/i.righton). Trading activ/i.rightties have remained relatively unchanged and client-driven.\n\n## Daily value at risk (VaR at 97.5%, one day) (audited)\n\n|                         | 2020                     | 2020                   | 2020                  | 2020                     | 2019                     | 2019                   | 2019                  | 2019                     |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Trading and non-trading | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 1 $mill/i.righton | Low 1 $mill/i.righton | Actual 2 $mill/i.righton | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 1 $mill/i.righton | Low 1 $mill/i.righton | Actual 2 $mill/i.righton |\n| Interest Rate Risk 3    | 93.9                     | 121.6                  | 29.0                  | 115.7                    | 28.9                     | 35.2                   | 24.1                  | 34.2                     |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk   | 6.4                      | 15.1                   | 3.0                   | 15.1                     | 4.3                      | 8.5                    | 2.3                   | 5.1                      |\n| Commodity Risk          | 2.5                      | 5.5                    | 0.7                   | 4.9                      | 1.3                      | 2.2                    | 0.8                   | 1.4                      |\n| Equity Risk             | 2.6                      | 5.4                    | 1.5                   | 1.5                      | 3.5                      | 4.6                    | 2.5                   | 2.5                      |\n| Total 4                 | 108.0                    | 158.0                  | 28.8                  | 1 3 7. 6                 | 30.2                     | 37.1                   | 24.1                  | 34.4                     |\n\n|                       | 2020                     | 2020                   | 2020                  | 2020                     | 2019                     | 2019                   | 2019                  | 2019                     |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Trading 5             | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 1 $mill/i.righton | Low 1 $mill/i.righton | Actual 2 $mill/i.righton | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 1 $mill/i.righton | Low 1 $mill/i.righton | Actual 2 $mill/i.righton |\n| Interest Rate Risk 3  | 10.6                     | 15.4                   | 6.5                   | 9.9                      | 8.0                      | 11.8                   | 6.3                   | 7. 0                     |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk | 6.4                      | 15.1                   | 3.0                   | 15.1                     | 4.3                      | 8.5                    | 2.3                   | 5.1                      |\n| Commodity Risk        | 2.5                      | 5.5                    | 0.7                   | 4.9                      | 1.3                      | 2.2                    | 0.8                   | 1.4                      |\n| Equity Risk           | 0.0                      | 0.0                    | 0.0                   | 0.0                      | -

The histor/i.rightcal one-year VaR observation period does not reflect the future possib/i.rightlity of a change in the currency regime such as sudden depegging. The other material Market Risk not reflected in VaR was associated with basis risks where histor/i.rightcal market price data for VaR is sometimes more lim/i.rightted and therefore proxied, generating a potential basis risk. Addit/i.rightonal capital is set aside to cover such 'risks not in VaR'. For further details on Market Risk capital, see the Market Risk section in the Standard Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures for 31 December 2020.\n\n## Backtesting\n\nIn 2020, there were three regulatory backtesting negative exceptions at Group level (in 2019, there were five regulatory backtesting negative exceptions at Group level). These exceptions occurred on:\n\n- \u00b7 10 March: When markets rallied following the announcement of measures to stimulate the US economy\n- \u00b7 13 March: When markets rallied as the Federal Reserve provided details of US Treasury purchases, and cut interest rates\n- \u00b7 24 March: When markets rallied as US Congress final/i.rightsed a $2 trill/i.righton package to stimulate the economy, also impact/i.rightng gold prices\n\nIn total, there have been three Group exceptions in the previous 250 business days which is with/i.rightn the 'amber zone' applied internat/i.rightonally to internal models by bank supervisors (Basel Committee on Banking Supervis/i.righton, Supervisory framework for the use of backtesting in conjunct/i.righton with the internal models approach to market risk capital requirements, January 1996).",

An analysis has been performed on these exposures to assess the impact of a 1 per cent fall in the US dollar exchange rates, adjusted to incorporate the impacts of correlations of these currencies to the US dollar. The impact on the posit/i.rightons above would be an increase of $381 mill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $358 mill/i.righton). Changes in the valuation of these posit/i.rightons are taken to reserves. For analysis of the Group's capital posit/i.righton and requirements, refer to the Capital Review (page 277).\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk is the potential for loss in the event of the default of a derivat/i.rightve counterparty, after taking into account the value of elig/i.rightble collaterals and risk mit/i.rightgation techniques. The Group's counterparty credit exposures are included in the Credit Risk section.\n\n## Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the posit/i.rightve and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivat/i.rightve transactions. The value of exposure under master netting agreements is $47,097 mill/i.righton (2019: $28,659 mill/i.righton).\n\nIn addit/i.righton, the Group enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) with counterparties where collateral is deemed a necessary or desirable mit/i.rightgant to the exposure. Cash collateral includes collateral called under a variat/i.righton margin process from counterparties if total uncollateralised mark-tomarket exposure exceeds the threshold and min/i.rightmum transfer amount specif/i.righted in the CSA. With certain counterparties, the CSA is reciprocal and requires us to post collateral if the overall mark-to-market values of posit/i.rightons are in the counterparty's favour and exceed an agreed threshold.\n\n## Liqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk\n\nLiqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk is the risk that we may not have suffic/i.rightent stable or diverse sources of funding to meet our obligat/i.rightons as they fall due.\n\nThe Group's Liqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk framework requires each country to ensure that it operates with/i.rightn predefined liqu/i.rightdity lim/i.rightts and remains in compliance with Group liqu/i.rightdity polic/i.rightes and practices, as well as local regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group achieves this through a combinat/i.righton of setting Risk Appetite and associated lim/i.rightts, policy formation, risk measurement and monitor/i.rightng, prudential and internal stress testing, governance and review.\n\n## Primary sources of funding (audited)\n\nThe Group's funding strategy is largely driven by its policy to mainta/i.rightn adequate liqu/i.rightdity at all times, in all geographic locations and for all currencies, and hence to be in a posit/i.righton to meet all obligat/i.rightons as they fall due. The Group's funding profile is therefore well divers/i.rightfied across different sources, maturit/i.rightes and currencies.\n\nA substantial portion of our assets are funded by customer deposits aligned with our policy to fund customer assets predominantly using customer deposits. Wholesale funding is divers/i.rightfied by type and maturity and represents a stable source of funds for the Group.\n\nWe mainta/i.rightn access to wholesale funding markets in all major financ/i.rightal centres in which we operate. This seeks to ensure that we have market intell/i.rightgence, mainta/i.rightn stable funding lines and can obtain optimal pric/i.rightng when performing our Interest Rate Risk management activ/i.rightties.\n\nIn 2020, the Group issued approximately $6.8 bill/i.righton of senior debt securit/i.rightes, $2.4 bill/i.righton of subordinated debt securit/i.rightes and $1 bill/i.righton of Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 securit/i.rightes from its holding company (HoldCo) Standard Chartered PLC. (2019: $6.1 bill/i.righton of term senior debt, $1 bill/i.righton of subordinated securit/i.rightes and $0.5 bill/i.righton of Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1).",

The Group mainta/i.rightned strong liqu/i.rightdity ratios despite the impacts of the COVID-19 stress. For further detail see the Liqu/i.rightdity section in the Standard Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures for FY 2020.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group LCR was 143 per cent (2019: 144 per cent) with a prudent surplus to both Board-approved Risk Appetite and regulatory requirements. Both the liqu/i.rightdity buffer and cash outflows grew during the year in line with the overall balance sheet growth.\n\nWe also held adequate liqu/i.rightdity across our footprint to meet all local prudential LCR requirements where applicable.\n\n|                                 | 2020   $mill/i.righton   | 2019   $mill/i.righton   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Liqu/i.rightdity buffer         | 175,948                  | 158,415                  |\n| Total net cash outflows         | 122,664                  | 110,269                  |\n| Liqu/i.rightdity coverage ratio | 143%                     | 144%                     |",

        "page_content": "## Stressed coverage\n\nThe Group intends to mainta/i.rightn a prudent and sustainable funding and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton, in all countries and currencies, such that it can withstand a severe but plausible liqu/i.rightdity stress.\n\nOur approach to managing liqu/i.rightdity and funding is reflected in the following Board-level Risk Appetite Statement:\n\n'The Group should hold an adequate buffer of high-quality liqu/i.rightd assets to survive extreme but plausible liqu/i.rightdity stress scenarios for at least 60 days without recourse to extraordinary central bank support.'\n\nThe Group's internal liqu/i.rightdity stress testing framework covers the following stress scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 Standard Chartered-specif/i.rightc - This scenario captures the liqu/i.rightdity impact from an id/i.rightosyncratic event affecting Standard Chartered only i.e. the rest of the market is assumed to operate normally.\n- \u00b7 Market wide - This scenario captures the liqu/i.rightdity impact from a market-wide cris/i.rights affecting all partic/i.rightpants in a country, region or globally.\n- \u00b7 Combined - This scenario assumes both Standard Chartered-specif/i.rightc and Market-wide events affecting the Group simultaneously and hence is the most severe scenario.\n\nAll scenarios include, but are not lim/i.rightted to, modelled outflows for retail and wholesale funding, Off-Balance Sheet Funding Risk, Cross Currency Funding Risk, Intraday Risk, Franchise Risk and risks associated with a deteriorat/i.righton of a firm's credit rating.\n\nStress testing results show that a posit/i.rightve surplus was mainta/i.rightned under all scenarios at 31 December 2020, i.e. respective countries are able to survive for a period of time as defined under each scenario. The combined scenario at 31 December 2020 showed the Group mainta/i.rightned liqu/i.rightdity resources to survive greater than 60 days, as per our Board Risk Appetite. The results take into account currency convertib/i.rightlity and portabil/i.rightty constraints across all major presence countries.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank's credit ratings as at 31 December 2020 were A+ with negative outlook (Fitch), A with stable outlook (S&P) and A1 with stable outlook (Moody's). A downgrade in the Group's long-term credit ratings would increase derivat/i.rightve collateral requirements and outflows due to rating-linked liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. At 31 December 2020, the estimated contractual outflow of a three -notch long-term ratings downgrade is $1.4 bill/i.righton.\n\n## External wholesale borrowing\n\nThe Board sets a risk lim/i.rightt to prevent excessive reliance on wholesale borrowing. External Wholesale Borrowing includes Certif/i.rightcates of Deposit, Commercial Paper, Deposits from Banks and Medium Term Notes. Lim/i.rightts are applied to all branches and operating subsid/i.rightaries in the Group and as at the reporting date the Group remained with/i.rightn Board Risk Appetite.\n\n## Advances-to-deposits ratio\n\nThis is defined as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer accounts. An advancesto-deposits ratio of below 100 per cent demonstrates that customer deposits exceed customer loans as a result of the emphasis placed on generating a high level of funding from customers.\n\nThe advances-to-deposits ratio has declined by 3.1 per cent to 61.1 per cent as customer deposit growth of 9 per cent outpaced customer loan growth of 3 per cent. Strong customer deposit growth was driven by TB CASA and Retail CASA partly offset by a reduction in Corporate and Retail term deposits, resulting in an overall improvement in the quality of the Group's customer deposit base. Customer loan growth was mainly in Retail mortgages in Hong Kong and Korea partly offset by lower volumes in corporate lending and transaction banking due to lower activ/i.rightty levels and demand, in part due to the impacts of COVID-19.\n\n|                                           | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Total loans and advances to customers 1,2 | 273,861                 | 264,841                 |\n| Total customer accounts 3                 | 448,236                 | 412,303                 |\n| Advances-to-deposits ratio                | 61.1%                   | 64.2%                   |",

        "page_content": "## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nOn 23 November 2016, the European Commiss/i.righton, as part of a package of risk-reducing measures, proposed a regulatory requirement for stable funding (net stable funding ratio (NSFR)) at European Union level. The proposal aims to implement the European Banking Authority's interpretat/i.righton of the Basel standard on NSFR (BCBS295). The NSFR is due to become a regulatory requirement in January 2022 with a min/i.rightmum of 100 per cent. Pending implementat/i.righton of the final rules, the Group continues to monitor NSFR in line with the BCBS' final recommendation (BCBS295).\n\nThe NSFR is a balance sheet metric which requires inst/i.righttutions to mainta/i.rightn a stable funding profile in relation to the characterist/i.rightcs of their assets and off-balance sheet activ/i.rightties over a one-year horizon. It is the ratio between the amount of available stable funding (ASF) and the amount of required\n\nstable funding (RSF). ASF factors are applied to balance sheet liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and capital, based on their perceived stabil/i.rightty and the amount of stable funding they provide. Likew/i.rightse, RSF factors are applied to assets and off-balance sheet exposures according to the amount of stable funding they require. At the last reporting date, the Group NSFR remained above 100 per cent.\n\n## Liqu/i.rightdity pool\n\nThe liqu/i.rightdity value of the Group's LCR elig/i.rightble liqu/i.rightdity pool at the reporting date was $176 bill/i.righton. The figures in the below table account for haircuts, currency convertib/i.rightlity and portabil/i.rightty constraints, and therefore are not directly comparable with the consolidated balance sheet. The pool is held to offset stress outflows as defined in European Commiss/i.righton Delegated Regulation 2015/61.\n\n|                                                                               | 2020                                              | 2020                                  | 2020                                    | 2020                                | 2020                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                               | Greater China &  North East Asia  $mill/i.righton | ASEAN &   South Asia  $mill/i.righton | Africa &   Middle East  $mill/i.righton | Europe &  Americas  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Level 1 securit/i.rightes                                                     |                                                   |                                       |                                         |                                     |                        |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                            | 10,104                                            | 16,622                                | 1,421                                   | 42,502                              | 70,649                 |\n| Central banks, governments /public sector entit/i.rightes                     | 32,580                                            | 8,434                                 | 1,569                                   | 33,652                              | 76,235                 |\n| Multilateral development banks and internat/i.rightonal  organisat/i.rightons | 4,919                                             | 453                                   | 236                                     | 6,818                               | 12,426                 |\n| Other                                                                         | -

Contractual maturit/i.rightes do not necessarily reflect actual repayments or cashflows.\n\nWith/i.rightn the tables below, cash and balances with central banks, interbank placements and investment securit/i.rightes that are fair value through other comprehensive income are used by the Group princ/i.rightpally for liqu/i.rightdity management purposes.\n\nAs at the reporting date, assets remain predominantly short-dated, with 59 per cent maturing in under one year. Our less than three-month cumulative net funding gap increased from the previous year, largely due to an increase in customer accounts as the Group focused on improv/i.rightng the quality of its deposit base. In practice, these deposits are recognised as stable and have behavioural profiles that extend beyond their contractual maturit/i.rightes.\n\n|

However, contractual maturit/i.rightes do not necessarily reflect the tim/i.rightng of actual repayments or cashflow. In practice, certain assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes behave differently from their contractual terms, especially for shortterm customer accounts, credit card balances and overdrafts, which extend to a longer period than their contractual maturity. On the other hand, mortgage balances tend to have a shorter repayment period than their contractual maturity date. Expected customer behaviour is assessed and managed on a country basis using qualitat/i.rightve and quantitat/i.rightve techniques, includ/i.rightng analysis of observed customer behaviour over time.",

The sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes shown represent the estimated change to a hypothetical base case projected net interest income (NII), plus the change in interest rate impl/i.righted income and expense from FX swaps used to manage banking book currency posit/i.rightons, under the different interest rate shock scenarios.\n\nThe interest rate sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes are ind/i.rightcative and based on simpl/i.rightfied scenarios, estimat/i.rightng the aggregate impact of an instantaneous parallel shock across all yield curves over a one-year horizon, includ/i.rightng the time taken to implement\n\nchanges to pric/i.rightng before becoming effective. The assessment assumes that non-interest rate sensit/i.rightve aspects of the size and mix of the balance sheet remain constant and that there are no specif/i.rightc management actions in response to the change in rates. Furthermore, revenue associated with trading book income posit/i.rightons is recognised in trading book income and is therefore excluded from the reported sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes.

The equivalent impact from a parallel decrease of 50 basis points would result in a reduction in projected NII of $380 mill/i.righton. The Group estimates the one-year impact of an instantaneous, parallel increase across all yield curves of 100 basis points to increase projected NII by $480 mill/i.righton.\n\nThe benefit from ris/i.rightng interest rates is primar/i.rightly from reinvest/i.rightng at higher yields and from assets re-pric/i.rightng faster and to a greater extent than deposits. Overall NII sensit/i.rightvity in all scenarios has increased versus 31 December 2019, driven by Treasury Markets risk management activ/i.rightty as rates fell during March 2020, and changes in the composit/i.righton of the balance sheet and modelling assumptions.\n\nThe asymmetry between the up and down 50 basis point shock has widened primar/i.rightly due to the low level of interest rates, which may constrain the Group's abil/i.rightty to reprice liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes should rates fall by a further 50 basis points, as well as differ/i.rightng behavioural assumptions, which are scenario specif/i.rightc. The decis/i.righton to pass on changes in interest rates is highly speculative and depends on a range of factors includ/i.rightng market environment and competitor behaviour.\n\nThe US dollar sensit/i.rightvity is dampened further by the exclusion of trading book revenue. The reported sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes include the cost of banking book liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes used to fund the trading book, however the income associated with the corresponding trading book assets is excluded and recognised in trading book income. Further informat/i.righton on the impact of changes in interest rates on trading book is set out in the Market Risk section (pages 233 to 237).",

The Group adds value to clients and the communit/i.rightes in which they operate by taking and managing appropriate levels of risk, which in turn generates returns for shareholders.\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) enables the Group to manage enterprise-wide risks, with the object/i.rightve of maxim/i.rightsing risk-adjusted returns while remain/i.rightng with/i.rightn our Risk Appetite. The ERMF has been designed with the explic/i.rightt goal of improv/i.rightng the Group's risk management, and since its launch in January 2018, it has been embedded across the Group and rolled out to its branches and subsid/i.rightaries.\n\nIn 2020, we completed a comprehensive review of the ERMF, and the following changes were approved by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 Given its overarching nature, Conduct Risk management has been incorporated as an integral component of the overall ERMF rather than viewed as a standalone risk. This change allows the Group to view Conduct Risk through the lens of deliver/i.rightng posit/i.rightve outcomes for our clients, markets, and internal and external stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Given the Group's diverse footprint, Country Risk management has also been incorporated as an integral component of the overall ERMF, as part of Group strategy and strategic risk management\n- \u00b7 Reputational Risk has been expanded to include Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk. There is increas/i.rightng focus on issues relating to environment, social and governance risk, from both regulators and investors, and the Group's commitments to be a leader in sustainable and responsible banking make this is a core tenet of our franchise\n- \u00b7 Technology Risk has been made more prominent with/i.rightn the Operational Risk Princ/i.rightpal Risk Type, in order to meet the needs of the dig/i.righttal agenda of the Group and further strengthen Technology Risk management capabil/i.rightties\n\nThe revised ERMF was approved on 10/uni00A0December 2020 and became effective on 1 January 2021.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nThe Group's risk culture provides guid/i.rightng princ/i.rightples for the behaviours expected from our people when managing risk. The Board has approved a risk culture statement that encourages the following behaviours and outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 An enterprise-level abil/i.rightty to ident/i.rightfy and assess current and future risks, openly discuss these and take prompt actions\n- \u00b7 The highest level of integr/i.rightty by being transparent and proactive in disclos/i.rightng and managing all types of risks\n- \u00b7 A constructive and collaborative approach in provid/i.rightng oversight and challenge, and taking decis/i.rightons in a timely manner\n- \u00b7 Everyone to be accountable for their decis/i.rightons and feel safe in using their judgement to make considered decis/i.rightons\n\nWe acknowledge that banking inherently involves risk-taking, and undesired outcomes will occur from time to time; however, we will take the opportunity to learn from our experience and formalise improvements. We expect managers to\n\ndemonstrate a high awareness of risk and control by self-ident/i.rightfying issues and managing them in a manner that will deliver lasting change.\n\n## Strategic risk management\n\nThe Group approaches strategic risk management as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 By conducting an impact analysis on the risk profile from growth plans, strategic in/i.righttiat/i.rightves and business model vulnerabil/i.rightties, with the aim of proactively ident/i.rightfying and managing new risks or exist/i.rightng risks that need to be reprior/i.righttised as part of the strategy review process\n- \u00b7 By confirm/i.rightng that growth plans and strategic in/i.righttiat/i.rightves can be delivered with/i.rightn the approved Risk Appetite and/or proposing addit/i.rightonal Risk Appetite for Board considerat/i.righton as part of the strategy review process\n- \u00b7 By validat/i.rightng the Corporate Plan against the approved or proposed Risk Appetite Statement to the Board. The Board approves the strategy review and the five-year Corporate Plan with a confirmat/i.righton from the Group Chief Risk Officer that it is aligned with the ERMF and the Group Risk Appetite Statement where project/i.rightons allow\n- \u00b7 Country Risk management approach and Country Risk reviews are used to ensure the country lim/i.rightts and exposures are reasonable and in line with Group strategy, country strategy, and the operating environment, consider/i.rightng the ident/i.rightfied risks.\n\n## Roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\n## Senior Managers Regime\n\nRoles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes under the ERMF are aligned to the object/i.rightves of the Senior Managers Regime. The Group Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall development and maintenance of the Group's ERMF and for ident/i.rightfying material risk types to which the Group may be potentially exposed. The Group Chief Risk Officer delegates effective implementat/i.righton of the Risk Type Frameworks (RTFs) to Risk Framework Owners who provide second line of defence oversight for the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types (PRTs). In addit/i.righton, the Group Chief Risk Officer has been formally ident/i.rightfied as the relevant senior manager responsible for Climate Risk management as it relates to financ/i.rightal and non-financ/i.rightal risks to the Group aris/i.rightng from climate change. This does not include elements of corporate social responsib/i.rightlity, the Group's contribut/i.righton to climate change and the Sustainable Finance strategy supporting a low-carbon transit/i.righton, which are the responsib/i.rightlity of other relevant senior managers.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Appetite and profile\n\nWe recognise the following constraints which determine the risks that we are will/i.rightng to take in pursuit of our strategy and the development of a sustainable business:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk the Group can assume, given its current capabil/i.rightties and resources, before breaching constraints determined by capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements and internal operational capabil/i.rightty (includ/i.rightng but not lim/i.rightted to technical infrastructure, risk management capabil/i.rightties, expertise), or otherwise fail/i.rightng to meet the expectations of regulators and law enforcement agencies\n- \u00b7 Risk Appetite is defined by the Group and approved by the Board. It is the maximum amount and type of risk the Group is will/i.rightng to assume in pursuit of its strategy. Risk Appetite cannot exceed risk capacity\n\nThe Board has approved a Risk Appetite Statement, which is underpinned by a set of financ/i.rightal and operational control parameters known as Risk Appetite metrics and their associated thresholds. These directly constrain the aggregate risk exposures that can be taken across the Group.\n\nThe Group Risk Appetite is reviewed at least on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for purpose and aligned with strategy, and focus is given to emerging or new risks. The Risk Appetite Statement is supplemented by an overarching statement outlin/i.rightng the Group's Risk Appetite princ/i.rightples.\n\n## Risk Appetite princ/i.rightples\n\nThe Group Risk Appetite is defined in accordance with risk management princ/i.rightples that inform our overall approach to risk management and our risk culture. We follow the highest ethical standards and ensure a fair outcome for our clients, as well as facil/i.righttating the effective operation of financ/i.rightal markets, while at the same time meeting expectations of regulators and law enforcement agencies. We set our Risk Appetite to enable us to grow sustainably and to avoid shocks to earnings or our general financ/i.rightal health, as well as manage our Reputational Risk in a way that does not materially undermine the confidence of our investors and all internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group will not compromise adherence to its Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue growth or higher returns. The Group Risk Appetite is supplemented by risk control tools such as granular level lim/i.rightts, polic/i.rightes, standards and other operational control parameters that are used to keep the Group's risk profile with/i.rightn Risk Appetite. The Group's risk profile is its overall exposure to risk at a given point in time, covering all applicable risk types. Status against Risk Appetite is reported to the Board, Board Risk Committee and the Group Risk Committee, includ/i.rightng the status of breaches and remediat/i.righton plans where applicable. To keep the Group's risk profile with/i.rightn Risk Appetite (and therefore also risk capacity), we have cascaded crit/i.rightcal Group Risk Appetite metrics across our Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types to our footprint markets with sign/i.rightficant business operations.\n\nCountry Risk Appetite is managed at a country or local level with Group and regional oversight. In addit/i.righton to Risk Appetite Statements for the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types, the Group also has a Risk Appetite Statement for Climate Risk which is a material cross-cutting risk that can manifest through other risk types. The Group Risk Committee, the Group Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, the Group Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committee and the Group Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committee are responsible for ensuring that our risk profile is managed in compliance with the Risk Appetite set by the Board. The Board Risk Committee and the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee (for Financ/i.rightal Crime Compliance) advise the Board on the Risk Appetite Statement and monitor the Group's compliance with it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe ind/i.rightvidual Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types' Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board are set out in the Princ/i.rightpal risks section ( pages 254 to 269 )\n\n## Risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and assessment\n\nIdentif/i.rightcation and assessment of potentially adverse risk events is an essential first step in managing the risks of any business or activ/i.rightty. To ensure consistency in communicat/i.righton we use Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types to classify our risk exposures. Nevertheless, we also recognise the need to mainta/i.rightn an overall perspective since a single transaction or activ/i.rightty may give rise to multiple types of risk exposure, risk concentrations may arise from multiple exposures that are closely correlated, and a given risk exposure may change its form from one risk type to another. There are also sources of risk that arise beyond our own operations such as the Group's dependency on suppliers for the provis/i.righton of services and technology. As the Group remains accountable for risks aris/i.rightng from the actions of such third parties, failure to adequately monitor and manage these relationsh/i.rightps could materially impact the Group's abil/i.rightty to operate and could have an impact on our abil/i.rightty to continue to provide services that are material to the Group.\n\nTo facil/i.righttate risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and assessment, the Group mainta/i.rightns a dynamic risk-scanning process with inputs from the internal and external risk environment, as well as potential threats and opportunit/i.rightes from the business and client perspectives. The Group mainta/i.rightns an inventory of the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types and risk sub-types that are inherent to the strategy and business model; and emerging risks that include near-term as well as longer-term uncertaint/i.rightes. Near-term risks are those that are on the horizon and can be measured and mit/i.rightgated to some extent, while uncertaint/i.rightes are longer-term matters that should be on the radar but are not yet fully measurable.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk Officer and the Group Risk Committee review regular reports on the risk profile for the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types, adherence to the approved Risk Appetite and the Group risk inventory includ/i.rightng emerging risks. They use this informat/i.righton to escalate material developments in each risk event and make recommendations to the Board annually on any potential changes to our Corporate Plan.",

Bespoke scenarios are applied to our traded and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.rightons as described in the sections on Traded Risk (page 257), and Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk (page 259).\n\nIn addit/i.righton to these, our stress tests also focus on the potential impact of macroeconomic, geopolit/i.rightcal and physical events on relevant regions, client segments and risk types.\n\nThe Board delegates approval of stress test submiss/i.rightons to the Bank of England to the Board Risk Committee, which reviews the recommendations from the Group Risk Committee.\n\nBased on the stress test results, the Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer and Group Chief Risk Officer can recommend strategic actions to the Board to ensure that the Group strategy remains with/i.rightn the Board-approved Risk Appetite.\n\n## Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types\n\nPrinc/i.rightpal Risk Types are risks that are inherent in our strategy and business model and have been formally defined in the Group's ERMF. These risks are managed through dist/i.rightnct RTFs which are approved by the Group Chief Risk Officer. The Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types and associated Risk Appetite Statements are approved by the Board.\n\nThe Group currently recognises Climate Risk as a material cross-cutting risk. Climate Risk is defined as the potential for financ/i.rightal loss and non-financ/i.rightal detriments aris/i.rightng from climate change and society's response to it.\n\nIn future reviews, we will continue to consider if exist/i.rightng Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types or incremental risks should be treated as cross-cutting risks.

To facil/i.righttate this, an ERMF effectiveness review was established in 2018, which follows the princ/i.rightple of evidence-based self-assessments for all the Risk Type Frameworks and relevant polic/i.rightes.\n\nThe annual ERMF effectiveness review, first introduced in 2018, was conducted in 2019 and 2020, and enables measurement of progress against the 2018 baseline. The 2020 effectiveness review has shown that:\n\n- \u00b7 Since the launch of the ERMF in 2018, the focus in 2020 has been on effective embedding of the framework across the organisat/i.righton and we continue to make progress on overall effectiveness",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In 2020, effectiveness has improved year-on-year, with a substantial focus on development of non-financ/i.rightal risk management practices. Financ/i.rightal risks continue to be managed more effectively on a relative basis as compared with the non-financ/i.rightal risks. This reflects the maturity of these Risk Type Frameworks and the underlying risk management practices.\n- \u00b7 Self-assessments performed in our footprint markets reflect the use of the ERMF and PRTs, with reinforced first-line ownership of risks. Country and regional risk committees continue to play an active role in managing and overseeing material issues aris/i.rightng in countries. Automation opportunit/i.rightes for manual risk oversight processes and effective change management will continue to be explored in 2021. Ongoing structured ERMF effectiveness reviews enable us to ident/i.rightfy improvement opportunit/i.rightes and proactively build plans to address them. Over the course of 2021, the Group aims to further strengthen its risk management practices and target improvements in the management of non-financ/i.rightal risk types.\n\n## Executive and Board Risk oversight\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Board has ultimate responsib/i.rightlity for risk management and is supported by six Board-level committees. The Board approves the ERMF based on the recommendation from the Board Risk Committee, which also recommends the Group Risk Appetite Statement for all Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types other than Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk. Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Appetite is reviewed and recommended to the Board by the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee. In addit/i.righton, the Brand Values and Conduct Committee oversees the brand, valued behaviours, reputation and conduct of the Group, and manages Reputational Risk in line with the Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk Type Framework.\n\n## Board and executive level risk committee governance structure\n\nThe Committee governance structure below presents the view as of 2020. Our business and regional committees have been amended to reflect the new organisat/i.rightonal structure, with changes effective 1 January 2021. Two new risk committees have been appointed by the Group Risk Committee. The Asia Risk Committee oversees the effective management of risk across the ASEAN & South Asia (ASA) and Greater China & North Asia (GCNA) regions, and replaces the ASA risk committee and GCNA risk committee. The Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) risk committee ensures the effective management of risk throughout CPBB, in support of the Group's strategy. The revised structure will be provided in the 2021 Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Credit Risk function is the second line control function responsible for independent challenge, monitor/i.rightng and oversight of the Credit Risk management practices of the business and functions engaged in or supporting revenuegenerating activ/i.rightties which constitute the first line of defence. In addit/i.righton, they ensure that credit risks are properly assessed and transparent; and that credit decis/i.rightons are controlled in accordance with the Group's Risk Appetite, credit polic/i.rightes and standards.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nSegment-specif/i.rightc polic/i.rightes are in place for the management of Credit Risk.\n\nThe Credit Policy for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage sets the princ/i.rightples that must be followed for the end-to-end credit process includ/i.rightng credit in/i.righttiat/i.righton, credit grading, credit assessment, product structuring, Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation, monitor/i.rightng and control, and documentation.\n\nThe Retail Credit Risk Management Policy sets the princ/i.rightples for the management of retail and business banking lending, account and portfolio monitor/i.rightng, collections management and forbearance programmes. In addit/i.righton, there are other Group-wide polic/i.rightes integral to Credit Risk management such as those relating to Risk Appetite, Model Risk, stress testing, and impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightoning.\n\nThe Group also set out standards for the elig/i.rightbil/i.rightty, enforceabil/i.rightty and effectiveness of Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation arrangements. Potential credit losses from a given account, client or portfolio are mit/i.rightgated using a range of tools such as collateral, netting agreements, credit insurance, credit derivat/i.rightves and guarantees.\n\nRisk mit/i.rightgants are also carefully assessed for their market value, legal enforceabil/i.rightty, correlation and counterparty risk of the protection provider.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group manages its credit exposures following the princ/i.rightple of divers/i.rightficat/i.righton across products, geographies, client segments and industry sectors\n\nCollateral must be valued prior to drawdown and regularly thereafter as required to reflect current market condit/i.rightons, the probabil/i.rightty of recovery and the period of time to realise the collateral in the event of liqu/i.rightdation. The Group also seeks to divers/i.rightfy its collateral holdings across asset classes and markets.\n\nWhere guarantees, credit insurance, standby letters of credit or credit derivat/i.rightves are used as Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation, the creditworth/i.rightness of the protection provider is assessed and monitored using the same credit approval process applied to the obligor.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt the Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Credit Risk.\n\nAt the executive level, the Group Risk Committee (GRC) oversees and appoints sub-committees for the management of Credit Risk - in particular the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Risk Committee (CCIBRC), the Private Banking Process Governance and Risk Committee, and the regional risk committees for ASEAN & South Asia, and Africa & Middle East. The GRC also receives reports from other key Group Committees such as the Greater China & North Asia Executive Risk Committee and SC Bank Risk Committee. These committees are responsible for overseeing the Credit Risk profile of the Group with/i.rightn the respective business areas and regions. Meetings are held regularly, and the committees monitor all material Credit Risk exposures, as well as key internal developments and external trends, and ensure that appropriate action is taken.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Credit Risk Type Frameworks are the formal mechanism which delegate Credit Risk authorit/i.rightes cascading from the Group Chief Risk Officer, as the Senior Manager of the Credit Risk Type, to ind/i.rightviduals such as the business segments' Chief Risk Officers. Named ind/i.rightviduals further delegate credit authorit/i.rightes to ind/i.rightvidual credit officers by applying delegated credit authority matrices, which determine the maximum lim/i.rightts based on risk-adjusted scales by customer type or portfolio.",

        "page_content": "Credit Risk authorit/i.rightes are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate. In Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage and Private Banking, the ind/i.rightviduals delegating the Credit Risk authorit/i.rightes perform oversight by review/i.rightng a sample of the lim/i.rightt applicat/i.rightons approved by the delegated credit officers on a monthly basis. In Retail Banking, credit decis/i.righton systems and tools (e.g. applicat/i.righton scorecards) are used for credit decis/i.rightoning. Where manual credit decis/i.rightons are applied, these are subject to period/i.rightc quality control assessment and assurance checks.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nWe regularly monitor credit exposures, portfolio performance, and external trends that may impact risk management outcomes. Internal risk management reports that are presented to risk committees contain informat/i.righton on key polit/i.rightcal and economic trends across major portfolios and countries, portfolio delinquency and loan impa/i.rightrment performance.\n\nThe Industry Portfolio Mandate, developed jo/i.rightntly by the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage business and the Risk function, provides a forwardlooking assessment of risk using a platform from which business strategy, risk considerat/i.rightons and client planning are performed with one consensus view of the external industry outlook, portfolio overviews, Risk Appetite, underwrit/i.rightng princ/i.rightples and stress test ins/i.rightghts.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage, clients and portfolios are subjected to addit/i.rightonal review when they display signs of actual or potential weakness; for example, where there is a decline in the client's posit/i.righton with/i.rightn the industry, financ/i.rightal deteriorat/i.righton, a breach of covenants, or non-performance of an obligat/i.righton with/i.rightn the stipulated period. Such accounts are subjected to a dedicated process overseen by the Credit Issues Committees in the relevant countries where client account strategies and credit grades are re-evaluated. In addit/i.righton, remedial actions, includ/i.rightng exposure reduction, security enhancement or exit/i.rightng the account, could be undertaken, and certain accounts could also be transferred into the control of Group Special Assets Management (GSAM), which is our special/i.rightst recovery unit for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage and Private Banking that operates independently from our main business.\n\nFor Retail Banking exposures, portfolio delinquency trends are monitored on an ongoing basis. Account monitor/i.rightng is based on behavioural scores and bureau performance (where available). Accounts that are past due (or perceived as high risk but not yet past due) are subject to a collections or recovery process managed by a special/i.rightst function independent from the orig/i.rightnation function. In some countries, aspects of collections and recovery activ/i.rightties are outsourced.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, an independent Credit Risk Review team as part of Enterprise Risk Management, performs judgment-based assessments of the Credit Risk profiles at various portfolio levels, with focus on selected countries and segments through deep dives, comparative analysis, and review and challenge of the basis of credit approvals. The review ensures that the evolving Credit Risk profiles of Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Retail Banking are well managed with/i.rightn our Risk Appetite and polic/i.rightes through prompt and forward-looking mit/i.rightgating actions.\n\n## Credit rating and measurement\n\nAll credit proposals are subject to a robust Credit Risk assessment. It includes a comprehensive evaluation of the client's credit quality, includ/i.rightng will/i.rightngness, abil/i.rightty and capacity to repay. The primary lending considerat/i.righton is based on the client's credit quality and the repayment capacity from operating cashflows for counterparties; and personal income or wealth for ind/i.rightvidual borrowers. The risk assessment gives due considerat/i.righton to the client's liqu/i.rightdity and leverage posit/i.righton. Where applicable, the assessment includes a detailed analysis of the Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation arrangements to determine the level of reliance on such arrangements as the secondary source of repayment in the event of a sign/i.rightficant deteriorat/i.righton in a client's credit quality leading to default.\n\nRisk measurement plays a central role, along with judgement and experience, in inform/i.rightng risk-taking and portfolio management decis/i.rightons. Since 1 January 2008, we have used the advanced internal ratings-based approach under the Basel regulatory framework to calculate Credit Risk capital requirements. The Group has also established a global programme to undertake a comprehensive assessment of capital requirements necessary to be implemented to meet the latest revised Basel III final/i.rightsation (Basel IV) regulations.\n\nA standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade system is used for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage. The numeric grades run from 1 to 14 and some of the grades are further sub-classif/i.righted. Lower numeric credit grades are ind/i.rightcative of a lower likel/i.righthood of default. Credit grades 1 to 12 are assigned to performing customers, while credit grades 13 and 14 are assigned to non-performing or defaulted customers.\n\nRetail Banking internal ratings-based portfolios use applicat/i.righton and behavioural credit scores that are calibrated to generate a probabil/i.rightty of default and then mapped to the standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade system. We refer to external ratings from credit bureaus (where these are available); however, we do not rely solely on these to determine Retail Banking credit grades.\n\nAdvanced internal ratings-based models cover a substantial major/i.rightty of our exposures and are used in assessing risks at a customer and portfolio level, setting strategy and optim/i.rightsing our risk-return decis/i.rightons. Material internal ratings-based risk measurement models are approved by the Model Risk Committee. Prior to review and approval, all internal ratingsbased models are validated in detail by a model validat/i.righton team, which is separate from the teams that develop and mainta/i.rightn the models. Models undergo annual validat/i.righton by the model validat/i.righton team. Reviews are also triggered if the performance of a model deteriorates materially against predetermined thresholds during the ongoing model performance monitor/i.rightng process which takes place between the annual validat/i.rightons.",

        "page_content": "## Credit Concentration Risk\n\nCredit Concentration Risk may arise from a single large exposure to a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties, or from multiple exposures across the portfolio that are closely correlated. Large exposure Concentration Risk is managed through concentration lim/i.rightts set for a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties based on control and economic dependence criter/i.righta. Risk Appetite metrics are set at portfolio level and monitored to control concentrations, where appropriate, by industry, specif/i.rightc products, tenor, collateralisat/i.righton level, top clients and exposure to holding companies. Single name credit concentration thresholds are set by client group depending on credit grade, and by customer segment. For concentrations that are material at a Group level, breaches and potential breaches are monitored by the respective governance committees and reported to the Group Risk and Board Risk Committees.\n\n## Credit impa/i.rightrment\n\nExpected credit losses (ECL) are determined for all financ/i.rightal assets that are classif/i.righted as amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. ECL is computed as an unbiased, probabil/i.rightty-weighted provis/i.righton determined by evaluating a range of plausible outcomes, the time value of money, and forward-looking informat/i.righton such as crit/i.rightcal global or country-specif/i.rightc macroeconomic variables. For more detailed informat/i.righton on macroeconomic data feeding into IFRS 9 ECL calculations, please refer to page 224.\n\nAt the time of orig/i.rightnation or purchase of a non-creditimpa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal asset (stage 1), ECL represent cash shortfalls aris/i.rightng from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. ECL continue to be determined on this basis until there is a sign/i.rightficant increase in the Credit Risk of the asset (stage 2), in which case an ECL is recognised for default events that may occur over the lifet/i.rightme of the asset. If there is observed object/i.rightve evidence of credit impa/i.rightrment or default (stage 3), ECL continue to be measured on a lifet/i.rightme basis. To provide the Board with oversight and assurance that the quality of assets orig/i.rightnated are aligned to the Group's strategy, there is a Risk Appetite metric to monitor the stage 1 and stage 2 expected credit losses from assets orig/i.rightnated in the last 12 months.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage and Private Banking, a loan is considered creditimpa/i.rightred where analysis and review ind/i.rightcate that full payment of either interest or princ/i.rightpal, includ/i.rightng the timel/i.rightness of such payment, is questionable, or as soon as payment of interest or princ/i.rightpal is 90 days overdue. These credit-impa/i.rightred accounts are managed by our special/i.rightst recovery unit (GSAM). Where appropriate, non-material credit-impa/i.rightred accounts are co-managed with the business under the supervis/i.righton of GSAM.\n\nIn Retail Banking, a loan is considered credit-impa/i.rightred as soon as payment of interest or princ/i.rightpal is 90 days overdue or meets other object/i.rightve evidence of impa/i.rightrment such as bankruptcy, debt restructuring, fraud or death. Financ/i.rightal assets are written off when there is no realist/i.rightc prospect of recovery and the amount of loss has been determined. For Retail Banking assets, a financ/i.rightal asset is written off when it meets certain threshold condit/i.rightons which are set at the point where empir/i.rightcal evidence suggests that the client is unlikely to meet their contractual obligat/i.rightons, or a loss of princ/i.rightpal is expected.\n\nEstimat/i.rightng the amount and tim/i.rightng of future recoveries involves sign/i.rightficant judgement and considers the assessment of matters such as future economic condit/i.rightons and the value of collateral, for which there may not be a readily accessible market. The total amount of the Group's impa/i.rightrment provis/i.righton is inherently uncertain, being sensit/i.rightve to changes in economic and credit condit/i.rightons across the regions in which the Group operates. For further details on sensit/i.rightvity analysis of expected credit losses under IFRS 9, please refer to page 224.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is a forward-looking risk management tool that constitutes a key input into the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, monitor/i.rightng and mit/i.rightgation of Credit Risk, as well as contribut/i.rightng to Risk Appetite calibrat/i.righton. Period/i.rightc stress tests are performed on credit portfolios/segments to antic/i.rightpate vulnerabil/i.rightties from stressed condit/i.rightons and in/i.righttiate timely right-siz/i.rightng and mit/i.rightgation plans. Addit/i.rightonally, multiple enterprise-wide and country-level stress tests are mandated by regulators to assess the abil/i.rightty of the Group and its subsid/i.rightaries to continue to meet their capital requirements during a plausible, adverse shock to the business. These regulatory stress tests are conducted in line with the princ/i.rightples stated in the Enterprise Stress Testing Policy. Stress tests for key portfolios are reviewed by the Credit Risk Type Framework Owners (or delegates) as part of portfolio oversight; and matters considered material to the Group are escalated to the Group Chief Risk Officer and respective regional risk committee.",

The business, acting as first line of defence, is responsible for the effective management of risks with/i.rightn the scope of its direct organisat/i.rightonal responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes set by the Board. The TRM function is the second line control function that performs independent challenge, monitor/i.rightng and oversight of the Traded Risk management practices of the first line of defence. The first and second lines of defence are supported by the organisat/i.righton structure, job descript/i.rightons and authorit/i.rightes delegated by Traded Risk control owners.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe Group controls its trading portfolio and activ/i.rightties with/i.rightn Risk Appetite by assessing the various Traded Risk factors. These are captured and analysed using proprietary analytical tools, in addit/i.righton to risk managers' special/i.rightst market and product knowledge.\n\nThe Group's Traded Risk exposure is aligned with its Risk Appetite for Traded Risk, and assessment of potential losses that might be incurred by the Group as a consequence of extreme but plausible events.\n\nAll businesses incurr/i.rightng Traded Risk must be in compliance with the TRTF. The TRTF requires that Traded Risk lim/i.rightts are defined at a level appropriate to ensure that the Group remains with/i.rightn Traded Risk Appetite.\n\nThe TRTF, and underlying polic/i.rightes and standards ensure that these Traded Risk lim/i.rightts are implemented. All Traded Risk exposures throughout the Group aggregate up to TRM's Group-level reporting. This aggregation approach ensures that the lim/i.rightts structure across the Group is consistent with the Group's Risk Appetite.\n\nThe TRTF and Enterprise Stress Testing Policy ensure that adherence to stress-related Risk Appetite metrics is achieved. Stress testing aims at supplementing other risk metrics used with/i.rightn the Group by provid/i.rightng a forward-looking view of posit/i.rightons and an assessment of their resil/i.rightence to stressed market condit/i.rightons. Stress testing is performed on all Group businesses with Traded Risk exposures, either where the risk is actively traded or where material risk remains. This addit/i.rightonal informat/i.righton is used to inform the management of the Traded Risk taken with/i.rightn the Group. The outcome of stress tests is discussed across the various business lines and management levels so that exist/i.rightng and potential risks can be reviewed, and related management actions can be decided upon where appropriate.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should control its trading portfolio and activ/i.rightties to ensure that Traded Risk losses (financ/i.rightal or reputational) do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise\n\nPolic/i.rightes are reviewed and approved by the Global Head, TRM annually to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt the Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Traded Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee delegates responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to the CCIBRC to act as the primary risk governance for Traded Risk. Where Traded Risk lim/i.rightts are set at a country level, committee governance is:\n\n- \u00b7 Subsid/i.rightary authority for setting Traded Risk lim/i.rightts, where applicable, is delegated from the local board to the local risk committee, Country Chief Risk Officer and Traded Risk managers.\n- \u00b7 Branch authority for setting Traded Risk lim/i.rightts remains with TRM which retains responsib/i.rightlity for monitor/i.rightng and reporting excesses.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Group's Risk Appetite Statement, along with the key associated Risk Appetite metrics, is approved by the Board with responsib/i.rightlity for Traded Risk lim/i.rightts, then tiered accordingly.\n\nSubject to the Group's Risk Appetite for Traded Risk, the Group Risk Committee sets Group-level Traded Risk lim/i.rightts, via delegation to the Group Chief Risk Officer. The Group Chief Risk Officer delegates authority for all Traded Risk lim/i.rightts to the TRTF Owner (Global Head, TRM) who in turn delegates approval authorit/i.rightes to ind/i.rightvidual Traded Risk managers.\n\nAddit/i.rightonal lim/i.rightts are placed on specif/i.rightc instruments, posit/i.rightons, and portfolio concentrations where appropriate. Authorit/i.rightes are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate and to assess the quality of decis/i.rightons taken by the authorised person. Key risk-taking decis/i.rightons are made only by certain ind/i.rightviduals with the skills, judgement and perspective to ensure that the Group's control standards and risk-return object/i.rightves are met. Authority delegators are responsible for monitor/i.rightng the quality of the risk decis/i.rightons taken by their delegates and the ongoing suitab/i.rightlity of their authorit/i.rightes.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nThe Group uses a Value at Risk (VaR) model to measure the risk of losses aris/i.rightng from future potential adverse movements in market rates, prices and volatil/i.rightties. VaR is a quantitat/i.rightve measure of Market Risk that applies recent histor/i.rightcal market condit/i.rightons to estimate the potential future loss in market value that will not be exceeded in a set time period at a set statist/i.rightcal confidence level. VaR provides a consistent measure that can be applied across trading businesses and products over time and can be set against actual daily trading profit and loss outcomes.",

        "page_content": "For day-to-day risk management, VaR is calculated as at the close of business, generally at UK time for expected market movements over one business day and to a confidence level of 97.5 per cent. Intra-day risk levels may vary from those reported at the end of the day.\n\nThe Group applies two VaR methodologies:\n\n- \u00b7 Histor/i.rightcal simulat/i.righton: this involves the revaluation of all exist/i.rightng posit/i.rightons to reflect the effect of histor/i.rightcally observed changes in Market Risk factors on the valuation of the current portfolio. This approach is applied for general Market Risk factors and the major/i.rightty of specif/i.rightc (credit spread) risk VaRs\n- \u00b7 Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton: this methodology is sim/i.rightlar to histor/i.rightcal simulat/i.righton but with considerably more input risk factor observations. These are generated by random sampling techniques, but the results retain the essential variab/i.rightlity and correlations of histor/i.rightcally observed risk factor changes. This approach is applied for some of the specif/i.rightc (credit spread) risk VaRs in relation to id/i.rightosyncratic exposures in credit markets\n\nA one-year histor/i.rightcal observation period is applied in both methods.\n\nAs an input to regulatory capital, trading book VaR is calculated for expected movements over 10 business days and to a confidence level of 99 per cent. Some types of Market Risk are not captured in the regulatory VaR measure, and these Risks-not-in-VaR (RNIVs) are subject to capital add-ons.\n\nAn analysis of VaR and backtesting results in 2020 is available in the Risk profile section (pages 185 to 247).\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nThe Counterparty Credit Risk aris/i.rightng from activ/i.rightties in financ/i.rightal markets is in scope of the Risk Appetite set by the Group for Traded Risk.\n\nThe Group uses a Potential Future Exposure (PFE) model to measure the credit exposure aris/i.rightng from the posit/i.rightve mark to market of traded products and future potential movements in market rates, prices and volatil/i.rightties. PFE is a quantitat/i.rightve measure of Counterparty Credit Risk that applies recent histor/i.rightcal market condit/i.rightons to estimate the potential future credit exposure that will not be exceeded in a set time period at confidence level of  97.5 per cent.\n\nPFE is calculated for expected market movements over different time horizons, based on the tenor of the transactions.\n\nThe Group applies two PFE methodologies, predominantly simulat/i.righton-based, as well as by way of add-ons.\n\n## Underwrit/i.rightng\n\nThe underwrit/i.rightng of securit/i.rightes and loans is in scope of the Risk Appetite set by the Group for Traded Risk. Addit/i.rightonal lim/i.rightts approved by the Group Chief Risk Officer are set on the underwrit/i.rightng portfolio stress loss, and the maximum holding period. The Underwrit/i.rightng Committee, under the authority of the Group Chief Risk Officer, approves ind/i.rightvidual proposals to underwrite new security issues and loans for our clients.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nTRM monitors the overall portfolio risk and ensures that it is with/i.rightn specif/i.righted lim/i.rightts and therefore Risk Appetite. Lim/i.rightts are typically reviewed twice a year.\n\nMost of the Traded Risk exposures are monitored daily against approved lim/i.rightts. Traded Risk lim/i.rightts apply at all times, unless separate intra-day lim/i.rightts have been set. Lim/i.rightt excess approval decis/i.rightons are based on an assessment of the circumstances driv/i.rightng the excess and of the proposed remediat/i.righton plan. Lim/i.rightts and excesses can only be approved by a Traded Risk manager with the appropriate delegated authority.\n\nTRM reports and monitors lim/i.rightts applied to stressed exposures. Stress scenario analysis is performed on all Traded Risk exposures in financ/i.rightal markets and in portfolios outside financ/i.rightal markets such as syndicated loans and princ/i.rightpal finance. Stress loss excesses are discussed with the business and approved where appropriate, based on delegated authority levels.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe VaR and PFE measurements are complemented by weekly stress testing of Market Risk and Counterparty Credit Risk to highl/i.rightght the potential risk that may arise from severe but plausible market events.\n\nStress testing is an integral part of the Traded Risk management framework and considers both histor/i.rightcal market events and forward-looking scenarios. A consistent stress testing methodology is applied to trading and nontrading books. The stress testing methodology assumes that scope for management action would be lim/i.rightted during a stress event, reflecting the decrease in market liqu/i.rightdity that often occurs.\n\nRegular stress test scenarios are applied to interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. This covers all asset classes in the Financ/i.rightal Markets and Treasury books. Ad hoc scenarios are also prepared, reflecting specif/i.rightc market condit/i.rightons and for particular concentrations of risk that arise with/i.rightn the business.\n\nStress scenarios are regularly updated to reflect changes in risk profile and economic events. The TRM function reviews stress testing results and, where necessary, enforces reductions in overall Traded Risk exposures. The Group Risk Committee considers the results of stress tests as part of its supervis/i.righton of Risk Appetite.\n\nWhere required, Group and business-wide stress testing will be supplemented by entity stress testing at a country level. This stress testing is coordinated at the country level and subject to the relevant local governance.",

The Treasury and Finance functions, as the second line of defence, provide independent challenge and oversight of the first-line risk management activ/i.rightties relating to Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk. In country, the Treasurer is supported by Treasury and Finance in implement/i.rightng the Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk Type Framework.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe Group develops polic/i.rightes to address material Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity risks and aims to mainta/i.rightn its risk profile with/i.rightn Risk Appetite. In order to do this, metrics are set against Capital Risk, Liqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book. Where appropriate, Risk Appetite metrics are cascaded down to regions and countries in the form of lim/i.rightts and management action triggers.\n\n## Capital Risk\n\nIn order to manage Capital Risk, strategic business and capital plans are drawn up covering a five-year horizon and are approved by the Board annually. The capital plan ensures that adequate levels of capital, includ/i.rightng loss- absorbing capacity, and an effic/i.rightent mix of the different components of capital are mainta/i.rightned to support our strategy and business plans. Treasury is responsible for the ongoing assessment of the demand for capital and the updating of the Group's capital plan.\n\nCapital planning takes the following into account:\n\n- \u00b7 Current regulatory capital requirements and our assessment of future standards and how these might change\n- \u00b7 Demand for capital due to the business and loan impa/i.rightrment outlook and potential market shocks or stresses\n- \u00b7 Available supply of capital and capital rais/i.rightng options, includ/i.rightng ongoing capital accretion from the business\n\nAddit/i.rightonally, Risk Appetite metrics includ/i.rightng capital, leverage, min/i.rightmum requirement for own funds and elig/i.rightble liab/i.rightlity (MREL) and double leverage are assessed with/i.rightn the Corporate Plan to ensure that our business plan can be achieved with/i.rightn risk tolerances.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should mainta/i.rightn a strong capital posit/i.righton includ/i.rightng the maintenance of management buffers suffic/i.rightent to support its strategic aims and hold an adequate buffer of high-quality liqu/i.rightd assets to survive extreme but plausible liqu/i.rightdity stress scenarios for at least 60 days without recourse to extraordinary central bank support\n\n## Structural FX Risk\n\nThe Group's structural posit/i.righton results from the Group's nonUS dollar investment in the share capital and reserves of subsid/i.rightaries and branches. The FX translation gains or losses are recorded in the Group's translation reserves with a direct impact on the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio.\n\nThe Group contracts hedges to manage its structural FX posit/i.righton in accordance with the Board-approved Risk Appetite, and as a result the Group has taken net investment hedges to partially cover its exposure to the Korean won, Chinese renminb/i.right, Taiwanese dollar and Indian rupee to mit/i.rightgate the FX impact of such posit/i.rightons on its capital ratios\n\n## Liqu/i.rightdity Risk\n\nAt Group, region and country level we implement various business-as-usual and stress risk metrics and monitor these against lim/i.rightts and management action triggers. This ensures that the Group mainta/i.rightns an adequate and well-divers/i.rightfied liqu/i.rightdity buffer, as well as a stable funding base, and that it meets its liqu/i.rightdity and funding regulatory requirements. The approach to managing risks and the Board Risk Appetite are assessed annually through the Internal Liqu/i.rightdity Adequacy Assessment Process. A funding plan is also developed for effic/i.rightent liqu/i.rightdity project/i.rightons to ensure that the Group is adequately funded in the required currencies, to meet its obligat/i.rightons and client funding needs.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nThe Group defines Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) as the potential for a reduction in future earnings or economic value due to changes in interest rates. This risk arises from differences in the repric/i.rightng profile, interest rate basis, and optional/i.rightty of banking book assets, liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and off-balance sheet items. IRRBB represents an economic and commercial risk to the Group and its capital adequacy. The Group monitors IRRBB against a Board-approved Risk Appetite.\n\n## Recovery and Resolution Planning\n\nIn line with PRA requirements, the Group mainta/i.rightns a Recovery Plan which is a live document to be used by management in the event of stress in order to restore the Group to a stable and sustainable posit/i.righton. The Recovery Plan includes a set of Recovery Indicators, an escalation framework and a set of management actions capable of being implemented in a stress. A Recovery Plan is also mainta/i.rightned with/i.rightn each major entity, and all recovery plans are subject to period/i.rightc firedrill testing.",

The BoE's preferred resolution strategy is whole Group single point of entry bail-in at the ultimate holding company level (Standard Chartered PLC) and would be led by the BoE as the Group's home resolution authority. In support of this strategy, the Group has been developing a set of capabil/i.rightties, arrangements and resources to achieve the following three outcomes, as per the BoE's approach to assessing resolvabil/i.rightty, published in 2019:\n\n- \u00b7 Adequate financ/i.rightal resources in the context of resolution\n- \u00b7 Being able to continue to do business through resolution and restructuring\n- \u00b7 Being able to coordinate and communicate effectively with/i.rightn the Group and with authorit/i.rightes and markets so that resolution and subsequent restructuring are orderly\n\nThe Group expects to disclose a summary of its preparations in 2022, alongside a public statement from the BoE on the resolvabil/i.rightty of each in-scope firm.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt the Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk. At the executive level, the Group Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committee ensures the effective management of risk throughout the Group in support of the Group's strategy, guides the Group's strategy on balance sheet optim/i.rightsation and ensures that the Group operates with/i.rightn the internally approved Risk Appetite and other internal and external capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements.\n\nThe Group Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committee delegates part of this responsib/i.rightlity to the Operational Balance Sheet Committee to ensure alignment with business object/i.rightves.\n\nRegional and country oversight under the capital and liqu/i.rightdity framework resides with regional and country Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committees. Regions and countries must ensure that they remain in compliance with Group capital and liqu/i.rightdity polic/i.rightes and practices, as well as local regulatory requirements.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer has responsib/i.rightlity for capital, funding and liqu/i.rightdity under the Senior Managers Regime. The Group Chief Risk Officer has delegated the Risk Framework Owner responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes associated with Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk to the Treasurer. The Treasurer delegates second-line oversight and challenge responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to relevant and suitably qualif/i.righted Treasury and Finance ind/i.rightviduals.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, the management of Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk at the country level is performed by the Country Chief Executive Officer and Treasury Markets respectively. The Group regularly reports and monitors Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk inherent in its business activ/i.rightties and those that arise from internal and external events. The management of capital and liqu/i.rightdity is monitored by Treasury and Finance with appropriate escalation processes in place.\n\nInternal risk management reports covering the balance sheet and the capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton of the Group are presented to the Operational Balance Sheet Committee and the Group Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committee. The reports contain key informat/i.righton on balance sheet trends, exposures against Risk Appetite and supporting risk measures which enable members to make informed decis/i.rightons around the overall management of the Group's balance sheet. Oversight at regional and country level is provided by the regional and country Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committee, with a focus on the local capital and liqu/i.rightdity risks, local prudential requirements and risks that arise from local internal and external events.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, an independent Liqu/i.rightdity Risk Review team as part of Enterprise Risk Management reviews the prudency and effectiveness of Liqu/i.rightdity and Interest Rate Risk management. The team focuses on balance sheet structure and strategy, policy development and implementat/i.righton, risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, monitor/i.rightng and control.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are an integral part of the capital and liqu/i.rightdity framework and are used to ensure that the Group's internal assessment of capital and liqu/i.rightdity considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on its risk profile. A number of stress scenarios, some designed internally, some required by regulators, are run period/i.rightcally. They provide an ins/i.rightght into the potential impact of sign/i.rightficant adverse events on the Group's capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton and how this could be mit/i.rightgated through appropriate management actions to ensure that the Group remains with/i.rightn the approved Risk Appetite and regulatory lim/i.rightts. Daily liqu/i.rightdity stress scenarios are also run to ensure that the Group holds suffic/i.rightent high-quality liqu/i.rightd assets to withstand extreme liqu/i.rightdity events.",

This Framework collectively defines the Group's operational risk sub-types which have not been classif/i.righted as Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types (PRTs) and sets standards for the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, control, monitor/i.rightng and treatment of risks. These standards are applicable across all PRTs and risk sub-types in the ORTF. These risk sub-types relate to execution capabil/i.rightty, governance, reporting and obligat/i.rightons, legal enforceabil/i.rightty, and operational resil/i.rightence (includ/i.rightng client service, third party vendor services, change management, people management, safety and security, and system availab/i.rightlity).\n\nThe ORTF reinforces clear accountabil/i.rightty for managing risk throughout the Group and delegates second line of defence responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to ident/i.rightfied subject matter experts. For each risk sub-type, the expert sets polic/i.rightes and standards for the organisat/i.righton to comply with, and provides guidance, oversight and challenge over the activ/i.rightties of the Group. They ensure that key risk decis/i.rightons are only taken by ind/i.rightviduals with the requis/i.rightte skills, judgement, and perspective to ensure that the Group's risk-return object/i.rightves are met.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe ORTF sets out the Group's overall approach to the management of Operational Risk in line with the Group's Operational Risk Appetite. This is supported by Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) which defines roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, control and monitor/i.rightng of risks (applicable to all PRTs and risk sub-types).\n\nThe RCSA is used to determine the design strength and reliab/i.rightlity of each process, and requires:\n\n- \u00b7 The recording of processes run by client segments, products, and functions into a process universe\n- \u00b7 The ident/i.rightficat/i.righton of potential breakdowns to these processes and the related risks of such breakdowns\n- \u00b7 An assessment of the impact of the ident/i.rightfied risks based on a consistent scale\n- \u00b7 The design and monitor/i.rightng of controls to mit/i.rightgate prior/i.righttised risks\n\nAssessments of residual risk and timely actions for elevated risks. Risks that exceed the Group's Operational Risk Appetite require treatment plans to address underlying causes.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt the Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Operational Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee is responsible for the governance and oversight of Operational Risk for the Group,\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to control operational risks to ensure that operational losses (financ/i.rightal or reputational), includ/i.rightng any related to conduct of business matters, do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise\n\nmonitors the Group's Operational Risk Appetite and relies on other key Group committees for the management of Operational Risk in particular the Group Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committee (GNFRC).\n\nRegional business segments and functional committees also provide enterprise oversight of their respective processes and related operational risks. In addit/i.righton, Country Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committees (CNFRCs) oversee the management of Operational Risk at the country (or entity) level. In smaller countries, the responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the CNFRC may be exercised directly by the Country Risk Committee (for branches) or Executive Risk Committee (for subsid/i.rightaries).\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe ORTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Operational Risk authorit/i.rightes is made. The GHRFOR delegates second-line authorit/i.rightes to designated subject matter experts (SMEs) responsible for the risk subtypes through this framework. The SMEs may further delegate their second-line responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to designated ind/i.rightviduals at a global business, product and function level, as well as regional or country level.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nTo deliver services to clients and to partic/i.rightpate in the financ/i.rightal services sector, the Group runs processes which are exposed to operational risks. The Group prior/i.righttises and manages risks which are sign/i.rightficant to clients and to the financ/i.rightal services sectors. Control ind/i.rightcators are regularly monitored to determine the residual risk the Group is exposed to. The residual risk assessments and reporting of events form the Group's Operational Risk profile. The completeness of the Operational Risk profile ensures appropriate prior/i.righttisat/i.righton and timel/i.rightness of risk decis/i.rightons, includ/i.rightng risk acceptances with treatment plans for risks that exceed acceptable thresholds.\n\nThe Board is informed on adherence to Operational Risk Appetite through metrics reported for selected risks. These metrics are monitored, and escalation thresholds are devised based on the material/i.rightty and sign/i.rightficance of the risk. These Operational Risk Appetite metrics are consolidated on a regular basis and reported at relevant Group committees. This provides senior management with the relevant informat/i.righton to inform their risk decis/i.rightons.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements for operational risks. This approach considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on the Group's Operational Risk profile. A number of scenarios have been ident/i.rightfied to test the robustness of the Group's processes and assess the potential impact on the Group. These scenarios include anti-money laundering, sanctions, as well as informat/i.righton and cyber security.",

This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 The endorsement of the Group's Green and Sustainable Product Framework and control framework for the review and approval of products and transactions which carry the sustainable finance label\n- \u00b7 Decis/i.righton-making authority on the elig/i.rightbil/i.rightty of a sustainable asset for any risk-weighted assets (RWA) relief\n\nThe Group Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committee has oversight of the control environment and effective management of Reputational Risk incurred when there are negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions of the Group due to failure of other PRTs. The regional and client-business risk committees provide oversight on the Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk profile with/i.rightn their remit. The Country Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committee (CNFRC) provides oversight of the Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk profile at a country level.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity RTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk authorit/i.rightes is made. The Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management delegates risk acceptance authorit/i.rightes for stakeholder perception risks to designated ind/i.rightviduals in the first line and second line or to Committees such as the GRRRC via risk authority matrices.\n\nThese risk authority matrices are tiered at country, regional, business segment or Group levels and are established for risks incurred in strategic coverage, clients, products or transactions. For environmental and social Risks, the ESRM must review and support the risk assessments for clients and transactions and escalate to the Reputational Risk leads as required. Risk authorit/i.rightes will be enhanced through 2021 as Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk is embedded throughout the Group.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nReputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk polic/i.rightes and standards are applicable to all Group entit/i.rightes. However, local regulators in some markets may impose addit/i.rightonal requirements on how banks manage and track Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk. In such cases, these are complied with in addit/i.righton to Group polic/i.rightes and standards.\n\nExposure to stakeholder perception risks aris/i.rightng from transactions, clients, products and strategic coverage are monitored through established triggers outlined in risk material/i.rightty matrices to prompt the right levels of risk-based considerat/i.righton by the first line and escalations to the second line where necessary. Risk acceptance decis/i.rightons and thematic trends are also being reviewed on a period/i.rightc basis.\n\nExposure to Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk is monitored through triggers embedded with/i.rightn the first-line processes where environmental and social risks are considered for clients and transactions via the Environmental and Social Risk Assessments; and considered for vendors in our supply chain through the Modern Slavery questionna/i.rightres.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nReputational Risk outcomes are taken into account in enterprise stress tests, and incorporated into the Group's stress testing scenarios. For example, the Group might consider what impact a hypothetical event leading to loss of confidence among liqu/i.rightdity providers in a particular market might have, or what the impl/i.rightcations might be for supporting part of the organisat/i.righton in order to protect the brand.",

        "page_content": "## Climate Risk - Material cross-cutting risk\n\nThe Group currently recognises Climate Risk as a material cross-cutting risk. Climate Risk is defined as the potential for financ/i.rightal loss and non-financ/i.rightal detriments aris/i.rightng from climate change and society's response to it.\n\nClimate Risk has been recognised as an emerging risk since 2017 and was elevated to a material cross-cutting risk in 2019. We are in the process of integrat/i.rightng Climate Risk into mainstream risk management in alignment with the Bank of England's Supervisory Statement 3/19 requirements. We have a Climate Risk workplan with defined milestones for 2021 and are making good progress. However, it is still a relatively nascent risk area which will mature and stabil/i.rightse over the years to come.\n\n## Roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nThe three lines of defence model as per the Enterprise Risk Management Framework applies to Climate Risk. The Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) has the ultimate second line and senior management responsib/i.rightlity for Climate Risk. The GCRO is supported by the Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management who has day-to-day oversight and central responsib/i.rightlity for second-line Climate Risk activ/i.rightties. As Climate Risk is integrated into the relevant Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types (PRTs), second-line responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes between the Risk Framework Owner (at Group, regional and country level) and the central Climate Risk team will be shared.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nAs a material cross-cutting risk manifests through other PRTs, risk mit/i.rightgation activ/i.rightties are specif/i.rightc to ind/i.rightvidual PRTs. Centrally, a cross-cutting standard is being put in place to capture practices across various PRTs. With/i.rightn each ind/i.rightvidual PRT, relevant framework, policy and standards are being updated as per the Climate Risk workplan. As an example, for Operational Risk in our own operations, the checklist for new property acquis/i.righttion has been updated to include a physical risk rating.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nBoard-level oversight is exercised through the Board Risk Committee (BRC), and regular  Climate Risk updates are provided to the Board and BRC. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee oversees implementat/i.righton of the Climate Risk workplan. The GCRO has also appointed a Climate Risk Management Forum consist/i.rightng of senior representatives from the business, risk, strategy and other functions such as sustainab/i.rightlity and legal. The Climate Risk Management Forum meets quarterly to discuss development and implementat/i.righton of the Climate Risk workplan, and to provide structured governance around engagement with the relevant PRTs impacted by Climate Risk.\n\n## Tools and methodologies\n\nApplying exist/i.rightng risk management tools to quantify Climate Risk is challenging given inherent data and methodology challenges, includ/i.rightng the need to be forward-looking over long time horizons. To leverage expertise from various areas, we have invested in a number of tools and partnerships:\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to measure and manage financ/i.rightal and non-financ/i.rightal risks from climate change, and reduce emiss/i.rightons related to our own activ/i.rightties and those related to the financ/i.rightng of clients in alignment with the Paris Agreement\n\n- 1.  Munich Re - we are using Munich Re's physical risk assessment tool, which is built on extensive re-insurance experience\n- 2. Baringa Partners - we are using Baringa's flagship climate models to understand climate scenarios, compute transit/i.righton risk and temperature alignment\n- 3. Standard and Poor - we are leveraging S&P and Trucost's wealth of climate data covering asset locations, energy mixes and emiss/i.rightons\n- 4. Imperial College - we are leveraging Imperial's academic expertise to advance our understanding of climate science, upskill our staff and senior management, and progress the state of independent research on climate risks with an acute focus on emerging markets\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management is supported by a centralised Climate Risk team with/i.rightn the ERM function. The Global Head, Risk Governance and Enterprise Risks and the Head of Climate Risk are responsible for ensuring and executing the delivery of the Climate Risk workplan which will define decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegations across the Group.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nThe Climate Risk Appetite Statement is approved and reviewed annually by the Board. In 2020, we began in/i.righttial management reporting on prior/i.righttised Climate Risk metrics and this will be further strengthened over 2021 with the development of risk categories and an authority matrix. Strategic Risk Appetite reporting will begin in 2022.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nClimate Risk intens/i.rightfies over time, and future global temperature rises depend on today's transit/i.righton pathway. Consider/i.rightng different transit/i.righton scenarios is crucial to assessing Climate Risk over the next 10, 20 and 50 years. Stress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements for Climate Risk and in 2020 physical and transit/i.righton risks were included in the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In 2021, we will undertake a number of Climate Risk stress tests, includ/i.rightng by the Bank of England and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. This will help us develop our understanding and management of Climate Risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails on the Group's Taskforce on Climate-related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures can be found on sc.com/tcfd",

        "page_content": "## Emerging risks\n\nIn addit/i.righton to our Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types that we manage through Risk Type Frameworks, polic/i.rightes and Risk Appetite, we also mainta/i.rightn an inventory of emerging risks. Emerging risks refer to unpredictable and uncontrollable events which may have the potential to materially impact our business. These include near-term risks that are on the horizon and can be measured or mit/i.rightgated to some extent, as well as longer-term uncertaint/i.rightes that are on the radar but not yet fully measurable.\n\nIn 2020, we undertook a thorough review of our emerging risks, using the approach described in the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) section (pages 248 to 253). The key results of the review are detailed below.\n\n## Key changes to our emerging risks:\n\nThe following items have been removed as emerging risks:\n\n- \u00b7 'Hong Kong Social Unrest' - This has been incorporated into 'US-China trade tensions driven by geopolit/i.rightcs and trade imbalance'\n- \u00b7 'China slowdown and impact on regional economies with close ties to China' - This has been removed as China is on target to be the first large market to rebound from the COVID-19 slowdown and is on track for recovery\n- \u00b7 'Climate related transit/i.righton and physical risks' - This has been removed as it is now formally classif/i.righted in the ERMF as a material cross-cutting risk. The emerging risks section of the Half Year report 2020 stated that, in addit/i.righton to princ/i.rightpal risks, the Group also recognises Climate Risk as a crosscutting risk that manifests through other princ/i.rightpal risks\n- \u00b7 'Negotiat/i.rightng the future EU-UK relationsh/i.rightp' - This has been removed as it has been resolved with the sign/i.rightng of an agreement. The outcome and impact of the future relationsh/i.rightp will need to be monitored and assessed\n- \u00b7 'Regulatory changes and regulatory reviews and invest/i.rightgations, legal proceedings' - These have been removed as they are considered intr/i.rightnsic risks for being in the financ/i.rightal services industry. Any Group-specif/i.rightc risks would be disclosed as appropriate\n- \u00b7 'Japan Korea diplomat/i.rightc dispute' - This has been removed due to the manageable immed/i.rightate impact to the Group's portfolio\n\nThe following items have been amended or added as new emerging risks:\n\n- \u00b7 'Rise of populism and national/i.rightsm driven by unemployment and a shift in global supply chains' - Populism is on the rise globally. Polic/i.rightes such as income redistr/i.rightbution, public spending increases, a rise in trade barriers and tariffs, tax cuts, restrict/i.rightons on imm/i.rightgration, and pro-national/i.rightst or anti-global rhetoric pose a risk to long-term economic progression\n- \u00b7 'Social unrest driven by economic downturns, water crises, medical provis/i.righton and food security' - 2019 and 2020 saw a surge in protests globally and the risk is these will increase with greater severity and frequency as economic growth is challenging, while health systems and food shortages are becoming more sign/i.rightficant factors. Energy, food transportation and nature all depend on a lim/i.rightted reserve of clean, flowing water, the availab/i.rightlity of which is becoming an increas/i.rightng concern\n- \u00b7 'Ris/i.rightng sovereign default risk and private sector creditor partic/i.rightpation in the Common Framework Agreement (CFA), - The combinat/i.righton of economic downturns, capital flight, commodity price collapses, polit/i.rightcal instab/i.rightlity resulting from the social consequences of COVID-19, and increased debt obligat/i.rightons for extending financ/i.rightal support may make it diff/i.rightcult for some countries to refinance their debts. The CFA for the world's poorest nations could impact market access and medium-term lending to some sovereigns.\n- \u00b7 'Unintended consequences of accommodative monetary policy and the risk of asset bubbles and inflat/i.righton' Developed market central banks have seen record balance sheet expansion in response to the economic downturn and there is a risk this may result in asset bubbles and/or inflat/i.righton in the longer term. Refinance risk may become an increas/i.rightng concern\n- \u00b7 'Third party dependency' - The global pandemic, it's economic fallout and increased cyber threats have impacted companies globally, resulting in sign/i.rightficant pressure on the financ/i.rightal health and security of suppliers, vendors and other third parties that the Group relies upon.\n- \u00b7 'Increase in long-term remote working provid/i.rightng new challenges' - This risk has increased as malic/i.rightous actors are increas/i.rightng their capabil/i.rightty and maturity by adapting to varying trends and new technologies to personalise attacks on organisat/i.rightons e.g. ransomware. This risk is exacerbated by remote working with reduced monitor/i.rightng capabil/i.rightties\n\nOur list of emerging risks, based on our current knowledge and assumptions, is set out below, with our subject/i.rightve assessment of their impact, likel/i.righthood and velocity of change. This reflects the latest internal assessment of material risks that the Group faces as ident/i.rightfied by senior management. This list is not designed to be exhaustive and there may be addit/i.rightonal risks which could material/i.rightse or have an adverse effect on the Group.\n\nOur mit/i.rightgation approach for these risks may not be successful in completely elim/i.rightnating them, but rather shows the Group's attempt to reduce or manage the risk. As certain risks develop and material/i.rightse over time, management will take appropriate incremental steps based on the material/i.rightty of the impact of the risk to the operations of the Group.",

The Group is well capital/i.rightsed with low leverage and high levels of loss-absorbing capacity.\n\n|                                            | 2020    | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| CET1 capital                               | 14.4%   | 13.8%   |\n| Tier 1 capital                             | 16.5%   | 16.5%   |\n| Total capital                              | 21.2%   | 21.2%   |\n| UK leverage                                | 5.2%    | 5.2%    |\n| MREL                                       | 30.9%   | 28.6%   |\n| Risk-weighted assets (RWA) $mill/i.righton | 268,834 | 264,090 |\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital and Tier 1 leverage posit/i.righton are well above current requirements. For further detail see the Capital section in the Standard Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures for FY 2020.\n\nThe Group's CET1 ratio increased 60 basis points to 14.4 per cent as profits, the sale of its interest in Permata, favourable regulatory changes and other movements more than offset higher RWA (mainly due to COVID-19 related credit migrat/i.righton) and the impact of the part completed share buy-back.\n\nIn the period, the PRA set the Group's current Pillar 2A requirement as a nominal value instead of a percentage of RWA. At the full year this equated to 3.2 per cent of RWA, of which at least 1.8 per cent must be held in CET1. This requirement will vary over time with movements in RWA and as Pillar 2A remains subject to regular PRA review. The Group's countercyclical buffer reduced by 21 basis points to 14 basis points mainly due to reductions in countercyclical buffer rates in Hong Kong and the UK in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of these changes to Pillar 2A and countercyclical buffer rates the Group's min/i.rightmum CET1 requirement reduced by 28bps to 10.0 per cent.\n\nOn 30 June, the PRA published a statement on various amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) includ/i.rightng revis/i.rightons to certain IFRS 9 transit/i.rightonal arrangements and the treatment of software assets in CET1 with the intent/i.righton of part offsetting COVID impacts on CET1 ratios (CRR Quick Fix). As at 31 December 2020 the CRR Quick Fix changes provided a CET1 benefit of around 29 basis points of which the change in treatment of software assets contributed 22 basis points. However, the PRA is consulting on mainta/i.rightning the earlier posit/i.righton whereby all software assets are fully deducted from CET1.\n\nThe Group's fully phased min/i.rightmum requirement for own funds and elig/i.rightble liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes (MREL) will be 22.5 per cent of RWA from 1 January 2022 based on RWA and leverage exposure at FY'20 1 . The Group's combined buffer (compris/i.rightng the capital conservation buffer, the GSII buffer and the countercyclical buffer) is addit/i.rightve to the min/i.rightmum MREL, resulting in a total MREL of 26.1 per cent of FY'20 RWA from 1 January 2022. The Group's MREL posit/i.righton was 30.9 per cent of RWA and 9.9 per cent of leverage exposure at 31 December 2020.\n\nDespite challenging market condit/i.rightons, the Group successfully raised around $10.1 bill/i.righton of MREL elig/i.rightble debt from its holding company in the period. Issuance was across the capital structure includ/i.rightng $1.0 bill/i.righton of Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1, $2.4 bill/i.righton of Tier 2 and around $6.8 bill/i.righton of callable senior debt.\n\nIn response to a request from the PRA and as a consequence of the unprecedented challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board decided to cancel the 2019 final div/i.rightdend of 20 cents per ordinary share and to suspend the $0.5 bill/i.righton share buy-back programme announced in February 2020. Addit/i.rightonally, no inter/i.rightm div/i.rightdend on ordinary shares was accrued, recommended or paid in 2020. Following recent PRA guidance, the Board has recommended a final div/i.rightdend for 2020 of $284 mill/i.righton or 9 cents a share and, in addit/i.righton, has decided to carry out a share buy-back for up to a maximum considerat/i.righton of $254 mill/i.righton. The impact of this buy-back will be reflected in the Group's CET1 posit/i.righton in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe Group is a G-SII, with a 1.0 per cent G-SII CET1 buffer. The Standard Chartered PLC G-SII disclosure is published at: sc.com/fullyearresults\n\n- 1 Potential future offset to Pillar 2A requirements from changes to the countercyclical buffer in PS 15/20 are not considered here. MREL end state requirements are based on FY'20 RWA, leverage exposure and Pillar 2A requirements.",

The increase was in the internal models approach (IMA) RWA due to increased market volatil/i.rightty and increased charges for IMA Risks not in VaR. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the IMA RWA multipl/i.righter as back-testing exceptions rolled out of the 250-day window and reduced posit/i.rightons in both the IMA and standardised approach.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk RWA reduced by $0.8 bill/i.righton, or 3 per cent from 31 December 2019 to $26.8 bill/i.righton.

Our responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for the audit of the financ/i.rightal statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financ/i.rightal statements in the UK, includ/i.rightng the Financ/i.rightal Reporting Council's (FRC) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entit/i.rightes, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffic/i.rightent and appropriate to provide a basis for our opin/i.righton.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn audit/i.rightng the financ/i.rightal statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financ/i.rightal statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's abil/i.rightty to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding management's going concern assessment process, includ/i.rightng the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19);\n- \u00b7 Review of the Corporate Plan, includ/i.rightng assessing the reasonableness of assumptions and histor/i.rightcal forecasting accuracy;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the results of management's stress testing, includ/i.rightng considerat/i.righton of princ/i.rightpal and emerging risks on funding, liqu/i.rightdity and regulatory capital;\n- \u00b7 Review/i.rightng correspondence with prudential regulators and authorit/i.rightes for matters that may impact the going concern assessment; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern disclosure included in note 1 to the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not ident/i.rightfied any material uncertaint/i.rightes relating to events or condit/i.rightons that, ind/i.rightvidually or collectively, may cast sign/i.rightficant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's abil/i.rightty to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financ/i.rightal statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financ/i.rightal statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes and the responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or condit/i.rightons can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's abil/i.rightty to continue as a going concern.",

This involved consider/i.rightng previous commercial relationsh/i.rightps and personal financ/i.rightal arrangements and confirm/i.rightng that all staff who work on the audit are independent of the Group. Following our selection, we held discuss/i.rightons with the predecessor auditor and reviewed their 2019 financ/i.rightal statement audit work papers. We gained an understanding of the Group's processes, includ/i.rightng the risk assessment and key judgements made by the predecessor auditors. At the outset of our audit we gained an understanding of the business issues and met with executive and key management of the Group and Parent Company. We used this understanding in the formulation of our audit strategy for the 2020 Group audit. Our procedures are in line with the requirements of ISA 510 in/i.righttial audit engagements to gain comfort over the opening balances as at 1 January 2020.\n\n## An overview of the scope of the Parent Company and Group audits\n\n## Tailor/i.rightng the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of material/i.rightty and our allocation of performance material/i.rightty determine our audit scope for each entity with/i.rightn the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opin/i.righton on the consolidated financ/i.rightal statements. We took into account the size, risk profile, the organisat/i.righton of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as material issues or misstatements noted in prior periods by the predecessor auditor when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financ/i.rightal statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitat/i.rightve coverage of sign/i.rightficant accounts in the financ/i.rightal statements, of the 365 reporting components of the Group, we selected 33 components across 20 countries covering entit/i.rightes with/i.rightn Bangladesh, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Mainland China, Malaysia, Niger/i.righta, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and the United States of America which represent the princ/i.rightpal business units with/i.rightn the Group. The defin/i.righttion of a component is aligned with the structure of the Group's consolidat/i.righton system, typically these are either a branch, group of branches or a subsid/i.rightary.\n\nWe took a centralised approach to audit/i.rightng certain processes and controls, as well as the substantive testing of specif/i.rightc balances. This included audit work over Global Business Services, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, Credit Impairment and Technology.\n\nOf the 33 components selected representing 20 countries, we performed an audit of the complete financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton of 28 components representing 17 countries ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characterist/i.rightcs. For the remain/i.rightng 5 components representing 3 countries ('specif/i.rightc scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specif/i.rightc accounts with/i.rightn those components that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the sign/i.rightficant accounts in the financ/i.rightal statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 86% (2019: KPMG 89%) of the Group's adjusted PBT, 89% of the Group's absolute operating income and 97% (2019: KPMG 96%) of the Group's total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 82% (2019: KPMG 88%) of the Group's adjusted PBT, 82% of the Group's absolute operating income and 90% (2019: KPMG 87%) of the Group's total assets. The specif/i.rightc scope components contributed 4% of the Group's adjusted PBT, 7% of the Group's absolute operating income and 7% (2019: KPMG 9%) of the Group's total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all sign/i.rightficant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of sign/i.rightficant accounts tested for the Group.\n\nOf the remain/i.rightng 332 components that together represent 14% of the Group's adjusted PBT, none are ind/i.rightvidually greater than 1.7% of the Group's adjusted PBT. For these components, we performed other procedures which included, but were not lim/i.rightted to, performing analytical reviews at a Group financ/i.rightal statement line item level, testing entity level controls, performing audit procedures on the centralised shared service centres, testing of consolidat/i.righton journals and intercompany elim/i.rightnations, inqu/i.rightring with local component teams and assessing the outcome of prior year local statutory audits.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.\n\n## Adjusted absolute profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n82% Full scope components\n\n4% Specif/i.rightc scope components\n\n- 14% Other procedures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Absolute operating income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n82% Full scope components\n\n7% Specif/i.rightc scope components\n\n- 11% Other procedures\n\n90% Full scope components\n\n7% Specif/i.rightc scope components\n\n3% Other procedures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establish/i.rightng our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by the Group audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms and another firm operating under our instruct/i.righton. Of the 28 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these directly by the primary audit team, EY London (includ/i.rightng audit of the parent Company). In addit/i.righton, the Group has centralised processes and controls over key areas in its shared service centres. Members of the Group audit engagement team provide direct oversight, review and coordinat/i.righton of our shared service centres audit teams.\n\nOur programme of planned vis/i.rightts to components and shared service centres in several locations were impacted by the current travel restrict/i.rightons and other imposed government measures as a result of COVID-19. As part of our alternative procedures during the current year's audit cycle, we undertook virtual site vis/i.rightts.

This includes the Group audit engagement partners and senior members of the primary audit team increas/i.rightng their involvement and\n\noversight, increased regular interact/i.rightons through calls and video conferences during various stages of the audit process, increas/i.rightng our written communicat/i.rightons to and reporting from the component teams and inv/i.rightting component teams to our virtual planning event and subsequent dedicated virtual events.\n\nFor all sign/i.rightficant and fraud risk areas, substantial elements of the audit work were led centrally, either with/i.rightn the Group audit engagement team, or with/i.rightn other teams performing centralised procedures.\n\nThese, together with the addit/i.rightonal procedures performed at Group level, gave us suffic/i.rightent and appropriate evidence for our opin/i.righton on the Group and Parent Company financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters (KAMs) are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most sign/i.rightficance in our audit of the financ/i.rightal statements of the current period and include the most sign/i.rightficant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we ident/i.rightfied. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and direct/i.rightng the efforts of the Group audit engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financ/i.rightal statements, and in our opin/i.righton thereon, and we do not provide a separate opin/i.righton on these matters.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit/uni00A0Committee\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Our response to the risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk 1.

Impairment of nonfinanc/i.rightal assets\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (pages 109 to 110);\n\n- a)  Impairment of aircraft: Accounting polic/i.rightes (page 369); and Note 18 of the financ/i.rightal statements\n\n## b)  Impairment of investment in subsid/i.rightary\n\nundertakings: Accounting polic/i.rightes (page 366); and Note 17 of the financ/i.rightal statements\n\n- c)  Impairment of Goodwill: Accounting polic/i.rightes (page 366); and Note 17 of the financ/i.rightal statements\n\nCOVID-19 and government measures taken in response to the pandemic have had, and are expected to continue to have, a sign/i.rightficant economic impact globally. As a result, the Group recorded impa/i.rightrment charges in respect of various non-financ/i.rightal assets during 2020, the most sign/i.rightficant of which are set out below. The Group owns a portfolio of aircraft, which are leased to airl/i.rightnes. The aircraft are measured at cost less accumulated depreciat/i.righton and impa/i.rightrment. As at 31 December 2020, the Group has reported a $132 mill/i.righton impa/i.rightrment charge in respect of aircraft. Each aircraft was tested for impa/i.rightrment.\n\nImpairment of aircraft is determined by comparing the carrying value to the higher of the current market value, provided by third party appraisers, and the value in use (VIU). The judgemental inputs into the VIU calculation are the discount rate and residual values.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, as at 31 December 2020, the Group impa/i.rightred goodwill by $489 mill/i.righton (2019: $27 mill/i.righton) and, in the Parent Company accounts, impa/i.rightred investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings by $349m (2019: $259m).\n\nImpairment of goodwill and investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings is determined by comparing the carrying value to VIU. The VIU is based on future profitab/i.rightlity forecasts, which are inherently uncertain, require sign/i.rightficant judgement and are subject to the risk of management bias.\n\nAside from profit forecasts, other sign/i.rightficant judgements included in the VIU are discount rates and macroeconomic assumptions such as long-term growth rates.\n\nConsequently, there is a risk that if the judgements and assumptions underpinn/i.rightng the impa/i.rightrment assessments are inappropr/i.rightate, then the aircraft, goodwill and investments in subsid/i.rightaries balances may be misstated.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of management's processes for impa/i.rightrment assessment and evaluated the design of controls.\n\n## Impairment of aircraft\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the Group's VIU methodology for testing the impa/i.rightrment of aircraft.\n\nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of the VIU model and engaged valuation special/i.rightsts to support the audit team in calculating an independent range for assumptions underlying the VIU calculations, such as discount rates and residual values. Where appraisal values were used to support the carrying value or as an input into the VIU, we benchmarked those values to external market data.\n\nWe evaluated management's sensit/i.rightvity analysis to assumptions in VIU calculations and performed stress testing for reasonably possible changes to the discount rate and market values.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and investment in subsid/i.rightary undertakings\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the Group's VIU methodology for testing the impa/i.rightrment of goodwill and investments in subsid/i.rightaries.\n\nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of the VIU model and engaged valuation special/i.rightsts to support the audit team in calculating an independent range for assumptions underlying the VIU calculations, such as the discount rate and long-term growth rates for each cash generating unit.\n\nWe reconciled the future profitab/i.rightlity forecasts to the Group's approved Corporate Plan. We performed audit procedures to assess the reasonableness of the forecasts by review/i.rightng the Group Strategy and Corporate Plan and conducted benchmarking analysis by review/i.rightng inst/i.righttutional forecasts and assessing the reasonableness of assumptions and testing histor/i.rightcal forecasting accuracy. In addit/i.righton, we performed a stand back test to assess whether the forecasts and assumptions util/i.rightsed by the Group were consistent across the key estimates. We evaluated management's sensit/i.rightvity analysis and performed independent stress tests to ident/i.rightfy the cash generating units that were most sensit/i.rightve to potential change in assumptions, includ/i.rightng the long-term growth rate, discount rates and profitab/i.rightlity forecasts. We assessed the appropriateness of goodwill disclosures in relation to the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the carrying values of non-financ/i.rightal assets.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit/uni00A0Committee\n\n## Impairment of aircraft\n\nWe concluded that management's methodology, judgements and assumptions related to the impa/i.rightrment assessment for aircraft were reasonable and in accordance with IFRS. We highl/i.rightghted the following matters to the Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Current market values and residual values were appropriate based on benchmarking to independently sourced market data; and\n- \u00b7 The discount rate was with/i.rightn our independent expectation of a reasonable range, with due regard to the risks facing the aviat/i.righton industry and the characterist/i.rightcs of the Group's portfolio of aircraft.\n\n## Impairment of Goodwill\n\nWe concluded that the goodwill balance as at 31 December 2020 was not materially misstated. We concluded that the disclosures in the annual report appropriately reflect the sensit/i.rightvity of the carrying value of goodwill to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions, and that these downside sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes could require an adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill in future.\n\n## Impairment of investment in subsid/i.rightary undertakings\n\nWe concluded that the investment in subsid/i.rightaries balance is not materially misstated as at 31 December 2020.",

Material/i.rightty provides a basis for determin/i.rightng the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined material/i.rightty for the Group to be $144 mill/i.righton (2019: KPMG $140 mill/i.righton), which is 5% of adjusted PBT. We believe that adjusted PBT provides us with the most appropriate measure for the users of the financ/i.rightal statements, given the Group is profit making; it is consistent with the wider industry and is the standard for listed and regulated entit/i.rightes and we believe it reflects the most useful measure for users of the financ/i.rightal statements. We also believe that the adjustments are appropriate as they relate to material non-recurring items.\n\n## Starting basis Starting basis\n\n- \u00b7  Statutory profit before tax $1.617bn\n\n## Adjustments Adjustments\n\n- \u00b7  Goodwill impa/i.rightrment of $489m\n- \u00b7  Provis/i.righton for regulatory matters of ($14)m\n- \u00b7  Restructuring costs of $382m\n- \u00b7  Net loss on businesses disposed of $38m\n- \u00b7  Total Adjustments per Note 2 of $895m\n- \u00b7  Management overlay relating to COVID-19 of $359m\n- \u00b7  Total Non-recurring items: $1.25bn\n\n## Material/i.rightty Material/i.rightty\n\n- \u00b7  Totals $2.87bn Adjusted profit before tax\n- \u00b7  Material/i.rightty of $144m (5% of Adjusted PBT)\n\nWe determined material/i.rightty for the Parent Company to be $130 mill/i.righton (2019: KPMG $110 mill/i.righton), which is 0.25% of net assets. We believe that net assets provide us with the most appropriate measure for the users of the Parent Company's financ/i.rightal statements, given that it is primar/i.rightly a holding Company.\n\nWe reassessed our material/i.rightty based on actual results for the year ended 31 December 2020 and have concluded that the planning material/i.rightty remains appropriate.\n\n## Performance material/i.rightty\n\nThe applicat/i.righton of material/i.rightty at the ind/i.rightvidual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probabil/i.rightty that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds material/i.rightty.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance material/i.rightty was 50% of our planning material/i.rightty, namely $72m (2019: KPMG $91m). We have set performance material/i.rightty at this percentage since this is an in/i.righttial audit.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtain/i.rightng audit coverage over sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightal statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance material/i.rightty. The performance material/i.rightty set for each component is based on the relative size and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance material/i.rightty allocated to components was $7m to $22m (2019: KPMG $1m to $60m).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which ident/i.rightfied misstatements are considered as being clearly triv/i.rightal.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $7m (2019: KPMG $5m), which is set at 5% of planning material/i.rightty, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitat/i.rightve grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitat/i.rightve measures of material/i.rightty discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitat/i.rightve considerat/i.rightons in forming our opin/i.righton.\n\n## Other informat/i.righton\n\nThe other informat/i.righton comprises the informat/i.righton included in the annual report includ/i.rightng the Strategic report, the Directors' report, the Directors' remuneration report, the Risk review and Capital review, and the Supplementary informat/i.righton, other than the financ/i.rightal statements, the specif/i.rightc disclosures or tables marked as 'audited' and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other informat/i.righton contained with/i.rightn the annual report.\n\nOur opin/i.righton on the financ/i.rightal statements does not cover the other informat/i.righton and, except to the extent otherwise explic/i.righttly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsib/i.rightlity is to read the other informat/i.righton and, in doing so, consider whether the other informat/i.righton is materially incons/i.rightstent with the financ/i.rightal statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we ident/i.rightfy such material incons/i.rightstencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financ/i.rightal statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other informat/i.righton, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, ind/i.rightvidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decis/i.rightons of users taken on the basis of these financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregular/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng fraud\n\nIrregularit/i.rightes, includ/i.rightng fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes, outlined below, to detect irregular/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intent/i.rightonal misrepresentat/i.rightons, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregular/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsib/i.rightlity for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.",

We also engaged EY financ/i.rightal crime special/i.rightsts to perform procedures on areas relating to anti-money laundering and sanctions. Through these procedures, we became aware of actual or suspected non-compliance. The ident/i.rightfied actual or suspected non-compliance was not suffic/i.rightently sign/i.rightficant to our audit that would have resulted in being ident/i.rightfied as a key audit matter.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptib/i.rightlity of the Group's financ/i.rightal statements to material misstatement, includ/i.rightng how fraud might occur by consider/i.rightng the controls that the Group has established to address risks ident/i.rightfied by the entity, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. Our procedures to address the risks ident/i.rightfied also included incorporation of unpredictab/i.rightlity into the nature, tim/i.rightng and/or extent of our testing, challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and journal entry testing.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to ident/i.rightfy non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inqu/i.rightries of Group legal counsel, money laundering reporting officer, internal audit, certain senior management executives and focused testing. We also performed inspect/i.righton of key regulatory correspondence from the relevant regulatory authorit/i.rightes.\n- \u00b7 For instances of actual or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations, which have a material impact on the financ/i.rightal statements, these were communicated to the Group audit engagement team and component teams who performed audit procedures such as inqu/i.rightries with management and external legal counsel, sending confirmat/i.rightons to external lawyers and meeting with external regulators. Where appropriate, we involved special/i.rightsts from our firm to support the audit team.\n- \u00b7 The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the Group audit engagement team, the component teams and the shared service centre teams to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabil/i.rightties, which included the use of special/i.rightsts where appropriate.\n\nA further descript/i.righton of our responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for the audit of the financ/i.rightal statements is located on the FRC's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsrespons/i.rightbil/i.rightties. This descript/i.righton forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, we were appointed as auditors of the Company and signed an engagement letter on 31 March 2020, and were appointed by the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2020, to audit the financ/i.rightal statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 and subsequent financ/i.rightal periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is one year, covering the year ended 31 December 2020.\n- \u00b7 The non-audit services prohib/i.rightted by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n- \u00b7 The audit opin/i.righton is consistent with the addit/i.rightonal report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsib/i.rightlity to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opin/i.rightons we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## David Canning-Jones (Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London\n\n25 February 2021",

Accounting polic/i.rightes\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Group financ/i.rightal statements consolidate Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) and its subsid/i.rightaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity account the Group's interests in associates and jo/i.rightntly controlled entit/i.rightes. The parent company financ/i.rightal statements present informat/i.righton about the Company as a separate entity.\n\nThe Group financ/i.rightal statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with internat/i.rightonal accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and with International Financ/i.rightal Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU IFRS). As the Group has early adopted 'Amendments to IFRS/uni00A09, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2', which have been endorsed by the EU and UK in January 2021 (see 'New accounting standards adopted by the Group' below), the Group has applied internat/i.rightonal accounting standards which have been adopted for use with/i.rightn the UK.\n\nThe Company financ/i.rightal statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with internat/i.rightonal accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its ind/i.rightvidual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these financ/i.rightal statements.\n\nThe following parts of the Risk review and Capital review form part of these financ/i.rightal statements:\n\na) Risk review: Disclosures marked as 'audited' from the start of the Credit Risk section (page 186) to the end of Other princ/i.rightpal risks in the same section (page 247).\n\nb) Capital review: Tables marked as 'audited' from the start of 'CRD Capital base' to the end of 'Movement in total capital', excluding 'Total risk-weighted assets' (pages 278 to 279).\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated and Company financ/i.rightal statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the histor/i.rightcal cost convention, as modif/i.righted by the revaluation of cash-settled share-based payments, fair value through other comprehensive income, and financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes (includ/i.rightng derivat/i.rightves) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe consolidated financ/i.rightal statements are presented in United States dollars ($), being the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the Company, and all values are rounded to the nearest mill/i.righton dollars, except when otherwise ind/i.rightcated.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn determin/i.rightng the carrying amounts of certain assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, the Group makes assumptions of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at the balance sheet date. The Group's estimates and assumptions are based on histor/i.rightcal experience and expectation of future\n\nevents and are reviewed period/i.rightcally. Further informat/i.righton about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimat/i.righton uncertainty and judgement, are set out in the relevant disclosure notes for the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit impa/i.rightrment, includ/i.rightng evaluation of management overlays and post-model adjustments, and determinat/i.righton of probabil/i.rightty weight/i.rightngs for Stage 3 ind/i.rightvidually assessed provis/i.rightons (Note 8)\n- \u00b7 Taxation (Note 10)\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal instruments measured at fair value (Note 13)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill impa/i.rightrment (Note 17)\n- \u00b7 Recoverable amounts for aircraft operating lease assets (Note 18)\n- \u00b7 Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges (Note 24)\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates (Note 32)\n\n## IFRS and Hong Kong accounting requirements\n\nAs required by the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules, an explanation of the differences in accounting practices between EU IFRS and Hong Kong Financ/i.rightal Reporting Standards is required to be disclosed. There would be no sign/i.rightficant differences had these accounts been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financ/i.rightal Reporting Standards.\n\n## Comparatives\n\nCertain comparatives have been restated in line with current year disclosures. Details of these changes are set out in the relevant sections and notes below:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 2 Segmental informat/i.righton\n- \u00b7 Note 13 Financ/i.rightal instruments\n- \u00b7 Note 19 Leased Assets\n- \u00b7 Note 25 Contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and commitments\n\n## New accounting standards adopted by the Group Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16\n\nIn August 2020 the IASB published the second phase of its amendments to IFRS concerning the global in/i.righttiat/i.rightve to replace or reform Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) that are used to determine interest cash flows on financ/i.rightal instruments such as loans to customers, debt securit/i.rightes and derivat/i.rightves. These amendments were endorsed by the EU on 14 January 2021 and by the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on 5 January 2021. Phase 2 focuses on issues expected to affect financ/i.rightal reporting when an exist/i.rightng IBOR is replaced with an alternative risk-free rate (RFR). The Group has elected to early adopt the Phase 2 amendments for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe first phase of amendments were early-adopted for the year ended 31 December 2019 (refer to pages 263 to 264 in the 2019 Annual Report), and continue to be in force until there is no longer uncertainty over the cash flows of both the hedged item and hedging instrument.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Accounting polic/i.rightes continued\n\nThe Phase 2 amendments contain a practical expedient, which requires changes to the basis for determin/i.rightng contractual cash flows as a direct result of interest rate benchmark reform to be treated as a change in floating interest rate, provided that the transit/i.righton from the IBOR benchmark to the alternative RFR takes place on an economically equivalent basis. This may include the addit/i.righton of a fixed spread to compensate for a basis difference between the exist/i.rightng IBOR benchmark and alternative RFR, changes to reset period, reset dates or number of days between coupon payment dates that are necessary to effect reform of an IBOR benchmark and the addit/i.righton of any fallback provis/i.righton to the contractual terms of a financ/i.rightal instrument that allow any of the above changes to be made.\n\nAny other change to contractual terms would be assessed under the Group's accounting polic/i.rightes for loan modif/i.rightcations, includ/i.rightng an assessment of whether derecognit/i.righton of the orig/i.rightnal instrument is required.\n\nThe amendments also provide reliefs which allow the Group to change hedge designat/i.rightons and corresponding documentation without the hedge relationsh/i.rightp being discont/i.rightnued. These include the abil/i.rightty to:\n\n- \u00b7 Redefine the descript/i.righton of the hedged item and/or hedging instrument\n- \u00b7 Redefine the hedged risk to reference an alternative RFR\n- \u00b7 Change the method for assessing hedge effectiveness due to modif/i.rightcations required by IBOR reform\n- \u00b7 Elect, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to reset the cumulative fair value changes in the assessment of retrospective hedge effectiveness to zero\n\nA hedge designat/i.righton may be modif/i.righted more than once, each time a relationsh/i.rightp is affected as a direct result of IBOR reform (for example, if the hedged item and hedging instrument are repapered into the alternative RFR at different times).\n\nWhere an alternative RFR designated as a non-contractually specif/i.righted risk portion is not separately ident/i.rightfiable (i.e. fair value hedge of a fixed-rate debt instrument), the Group may assume that the alternative RFR is deemed to have met that requirement provided it reasonably expected the alternative RFR will be separately ident/i.rightfiable with/i.rightn 24 months.\n\nThe 24-month period begins ind/i.rightvidually for each benchmark, but if it is subsequently assessed that the alternative RFR is no longer expected to be separately ident/i.rightfiable with/i.rightn 24 months of the first hedge designat/i.righton of a benchmark, then all hedges for that benchmark are discont/i.rightnued prospectively.\n\nDisclosures required under these amendments may be found in the Emerging Risks section on page 274 and in Notes 13 and 14.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 16: COVID-19-related Rent Concessions\n\nIn May 2020 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 Leases, which were endorsed by the EU on 12 October 2020. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginn/i.rightng on or after 1 June 2020, but the Group has elected to early adopt the amendments for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nThe amendments provide lessees of premises and equipment a practical expedient that permits them not to assess whether a rent concession granted as a direct\n\nconsequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is accounted for as a lease modif/i.rightcation. Entit/i.rightes may therefore account for such rent concessions by reducing the lease liab/i.rightlity by the value of the concession, with a corresponding gain recorded in Other income. A rent concession is only deemed a direct consequence of COVID-19 if all the following criter/i.righta are met:\n\n- \u00b7 A change in lease payments results in revised considerat/i.righton for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the considerat/i.righton for the lease immed/i.rightately preceding the change;\n- \u00b7 Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments orig/i.rightnally due up to and includ/i.rightng 30 June 2021 (this includes the case where the change results in reduced lease payments before this date and increased lease payments after this date); and\n- \u00b7 There is no substantive change to other terms and condit/i.rightons of the lease\n\nThe amendments have not had a material effect on the Group's financ/i.rightal statements, and do not result in any adjustment to opening retained earnings as of 1 January 2020.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3: Defin/i.righttion of a Business\n\nIn October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to the defin/i.righttion of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinat/i.rightons, which were endorsed by the EU in April 2020. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginn/i.rightng on or after 1 January 2020 and apply prospectively. The amendments:\n\n- \u00b7 Clarify the min/i.rightmum requirements for a business;\n- \u00b7 Remove the assessment of whether market partic/i.rightpants are capable of replacing any miss/i.rightng elements;\n- \u00b7 Add guidance to help entit/i.rightes assess whether an acquired process is substantive;\n- \u00b7 Narrow the defin/i.righttions of a business and of outputs; and\n- \u00b7 Introduce an optional fair value concentration test\n\nThese amendments do not have a material effect on these financ/i.rightal statements as no transactions in scope of IFRS 3 have occurred during the period and no adjustment is required to opening retained earnings.\n\n## Conceptual Framework for Financ/i.rightal Reporting\n\nIn March 2018 the IASB published a revised Conceptual Framework for Financ/i.rightal Reporting, often referred to as the 'Conceptual Framework', applicable to IFRS preparers for annual periods beginn/i.rightng on or after 1 January 2020. The Conceptual Framework provides guidance to preparers on determin/i.rightng accounting polic/i.rightes where no specif/i.rightc IFRS or IAS standard applies to a particular transaction or where a standard allows for an accounting policy choice. It includes lim/i.rightted revis/i.rightons of defin/i.righttions of an asset and a liab/i.rightlity, as well as new guidance on measurement and derecognit/i.righton, presentation and disclosure. The concept of prudence has been reintroduced with the statement that prudence supports neutrality. The Conceptual Framework is not an IFRS standard and does not replace any specif/i.rightc standards. The changes in the Conceptual Framework are not considered material to the Group since all of the Group's sign/i.rightficant accounting polic/i.rightes are derived from specif/i.rightc\n\nIFRS or IAS standards.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Accounting polic/i.rightes continued\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Defin/i.righttion of Material\n\nIn October 2018 the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financ/i.rightal Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Polic/i.rightes, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors ('the amendments'), applicable to IFRS preparers for annual periods beginn/i.rightng on or after 1 January 2020. The purpose is to align the defin/i.righttion of 'material' across the standards and to clarify certain aspects of the defin/i.righttion. Information is 'material' if omitt/i.rightng, misstat/i.rightng or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decis/i.rightons that the primary users of general-purpose financ/i.rightal statements make on the basis of those financ/i.rightal statements, which provide financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton about a specif/i.rightc reporting entity. The revised defin/i.righttion is already aligned to how the Group assesses whether the effect of a change in accounting policy, change in accounting estimate or error would be considered 'material' to the primary users of the Group's financ/i.rightal statements, hence these amendments have no specif/i.rightc effect on the preparation of these financ/i.rightal statements and are not expected to affect the preparation of future financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## New accounting standards in issue but not yet effective IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017 to replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and to establish a comprehensive standard for inceptors of insurance polic/i.rightes. The effective date has been deferred to 1 January 2023. The Group is assessing the likely implementat/i.righton impact on adopting the standards on its financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9 Financ/i.rightal Instruments: Fees in the '10 per cent' test for derecognit/i.righton of financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nIn May 2020 the IASB published its 2018-2020 annual improvements process which provides non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRS. This publicat/i.righton included changes to IFRS 9 that will be effective prospectively from 1 January 2022, with early adoption permitted. Under these amendments, when assessing changes in terms of a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity, the only fees considered in the assessment of whether the terms of a new or modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity are substantially different (i.e. a change in present value of more than 10 per cent) from the terms of the orig/i.rightnal financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity are fees paid or received between the borrower or lender. This includes fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. The effect of these amendments is not expected to be material to the Group's financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## 2. Segmental informat/i.righton\n\nThe Group's segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments and is reported consistently with the internal performance framework and as presented to the Group's Management Team. The four client segments are: Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking, Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, and Private Banking. The four geographic regions are: Greater China & North Asia, ASEAN & South Asia, Africa & Middle East, and Europe & Americas. Activ/i.rightties not directly related to a client segment and/or geographic region are included in Central & other items. These mainly include Corporate Centre costs, treasury activ/i.rightties, certain strategic investments and the UK bank levy.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThese financ/i.rightal statements were approved by the Board of directors on 25 February 2021. The directors have made an assessment of the Group's abil/i.rightty to continue as a going concern. This assessment has been made having considered the impact of COVID-19, macroeconomic and geopolit/i.rightcal headwinds, includ/i.rightng:\n\n- \u00b7 A review of the Group Strategy and Corporate Plan, both of which cover a year from the date of sign/i.rightng the annual report\n- \u00b7 An assessment of the actual performance to date, loan book quality, credit impa/i.rightrment, legal, regulatory and compliance matters, and the updated annual budget\n- \u00b7 Considerat/i.righton of stress testing performed, includ/i.rightng a bespoke COVID-19 stress test with scenario analysis focused on mild, moderate, severe and extreme variants across the Group's footprint markets to ensure that the Group has suffic/i.rightent capital to withstand this shock. Under a range of scenarios, the results of these stress tests demonstrate that the Group has suffic/i.rightent capital and liqu/i.rightdity to continue as a going concern and meet min/i.rightmum regulatory capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the capital, funding and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton of the Group, includ/i.rightng the capital and leverage ratios, and ICAAP which summarises the Group's capital and risk assessment processes, assesses its capital requirements and the adequacy of resources to meet them. Further, funding and liqu/i.rightdity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics, includ/i.rightng the ADR and LCR ratios\n- \u00b7 The Group's Internal Liqu/i.rightdity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which considers the Group's liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton, its framework and whether suffic/i.rightent liqu/i.rightdity resources are being mainta/i.rightned to meet liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes as they fall due, was also reviewed\n- \u00b7 The level of debt in issue, includ/i.rightng redemptions and issuances during the year, debt falling due for repayment in the next 12 months and further planned debt issuances, includ/i.rightng the appetite in the market for the Group's debt.\n- \u00b7 A detailed review of all princ/i.rightpal and emerging risks\n\nBased on the analysis performed, the directors confirm they are satisf/i.righted that the Group has adequate resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financ/i.rightal statements. For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for preparing the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\nThe following should also be noted:\n\n- \u00b7 Transactions and funding between the segments are carried out on an arm's-length basis\n- \u00b7 Corporate Centre costs represent stewardship and central management services roles and activ/i.rightties that are not directly attributable to business or country operations\n- \u00b7 Treasury markets, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associate investments are managed in the regions and are included with/i.rightn the applicable region. However, they are not managed directly by a client segment and are therefore included in the Central & other items segment",

Segmental informat/i.righton continued\n\n- \u00b7 In addit/i.righton to treasury activ/i.rightties, Corporate Centre costs and other Group-related functions, Central & other items for regions includes globally run businesses or activ/i.rightties that are managed by the client segments but not directly by geographic management. These include Princ/i.rightpal Finance and Portfolio Management\n- \u00b7 The Group allocated central costs (excluding Corporate Centre costs) relating to client segments and geographic regions using appropriate business drivers (such as in proportion to the direct cost base of each segment before allocation of ind/i.rightrect costs) and these are reported with/i.rightn operating expenses\n- \u00b7 The segmental and regional results reported for 2020 do not reflect changes made to the Group organisat/i.righton in January 2021 as discussed in the Strategic Report. The Group's segmental and regional results will start to reflect those organisat/i.rightonal changes in 2021.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe analysis reflects how the client segments and geographic regions are managed internally. This is described as the Management View (on an underlying basis) and is princ/i.rightpally the location from which a client relationsh/i.rightp is managed, which may differ from where it is financ/i.rightally booked and may be shared between businesses and/or regions. In certain instances this approach is not appropriate and a Financ/i.rightal View is disclosed, that is, the location in which the transaction or balance was booked. Typically, the Financ/i.rightal View is used in areas such as the Market and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk reviews where actual booking location is more important for an assessment. Segmental informat/i.righton is therefore on a Management View unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Restructuring items excluded from underlying results\n\nThe Group's statutory performance is adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent, other infrequent and/ or exceptional transactions that are sign/i.rightficant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period and items which management and investors would ordinar/i.rightly ident/i.rightfy separately when assessing underlying performance period-by period.\n\nRestructuring charges of $382 mill/i.righton for 2020 is broadly split evenly between actions to exit the Group's discont/i.rightnued businesses, primar/i.rightly ship leasing and princ/i.rightpal finance, and actions to transform the organisat/i.righton to improve productiv/i.rightty, primar/i.rightly redundancy related charges. Charges related to restructuring increased 50% due to the sign/i.rightficant decline in income from discont/i.rightnued businesses, includ/i.rightng negative movements in the valuation of princ/i.rightpal finance investments.\n\nThe goodwill impa/i.rightrment of $489 mill/i.righton reflects writ/i.rightng off all goodwill relating to the Group's businesses in India, UAE, Indonesia and Brunei. This was primar/i.rightly due to lower forwardlooking cash flows, lower economic growth forecasts and higher discount rates reflecting lower interest rate environments.\n\nOther restructuring items also include a $43 mill/i.righton dilut/i.righton loss following the in/i.righttial public offering of the Group's associate in China Bohai Bank. Charges related to other items reduced 86% primar/i.rightly due to the regulatory provis/i.rightons booked in the prior year.\n\nReconcil/i.rightations between underlying and statutory results are set out in the tables below:\n\n## Profit before taxation (PBT)\n\n|                                                                       | 2020                        | 2020                                                       | 2020                           | 2020                                                               | 2020                                         | 2020                                                                                | 2020                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Underlying  $mill/i.righton | Provis/i.righton for  regulatory  matters  $mill/i.righton | Restructuring  $mill/i.righton | Net loss on  businesses  disposed/  held for sale  $mill/i.righton | Goodwill  impa/i.rightrment  $mill/i.righton | Share of  profits of   PT Bank  Permata  Tbk jo/i.rightnt  venture  $mill/i.righton | Statutory   $mill/i.righton |\n| Operating income                                                      | 14,765                      | -

Net interest income\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nInterest income for financ/i.rightal assets held at either fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost, and interest expense on all financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financ/i.rightal asset or a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financ/i.rightal instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal asset or financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows consider/i.rightng all contractual terms of the financ/i.rightal instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Where the estimates of cash flows have been revised, the carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal asset or liab/i.rightlity is adjusted to reflect the actual and revised cash flows, discounted at the instrument's orig/i.rightnal effective interest rate. The adjustment is recognised as interest income or expense in the period in which the revis/i.righton is made.\n\nInterest income for financ/i.rightal assets that are either held at fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost that have become credit-impa/i.rightred subsequent to in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton (stage 3) and have had amounts written off, is recognised using the credit-adjusted effective interest rate. This rate is calculated in the same manner as the effective interest rate except that expected credit losses are included in the expected cash flows. Interest income is therefore recognised on the amortised cost of the financ/i.rightal asset includ/i.rightng expected credit losses. Should the Credit Risk on a stage 3 financ/i.rightal asset improve such that the financ/i.rightal asset is no longer considered credit-impa/i.rightred, interest income recognit/i.righton reverts to a computation based on the rehabil/i.righttated gross carrying value of the financ/i.rightal asset.\n\n|                                                                                              | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Balances at central banks                                                                    | 113                     | 329                     |\n| Loans and advances to banks                                                                  | 801                     | 1,834                   |\n| Loans and advances to customers                                                              | 8,473                   | 10,693                  |\n| Listed debt securit/i.rightes                                                                | 1,783                   | 2,113                   |\n| Unlisted debt securit/i.rightes                                                              | 542                     | 796                     |\n| Other elig/i.rightble bills                                                                  | 495                     | 702                     |\n| Accrued on impa/i.rightred assets (discount unwind)                                          | 85                      | 82                      |\n| Interest income                                                                              | 12,292                  | 16,549                  |\n| Of which: financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 2,134                   | 3,246                   |\n| Deposits by banks                                                                            | 237                     | 739                     |\n| Customer accounts                                                                            | 3,671                   | 6,202                   |\n| Debt securit/i.rightes in issue                                                              | 836                     | 1,120                   |\n| Subordinated liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and other borrowed funds                              | 637                     | 756                     |\n| Interest expense on IFRS 16 lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes                                  | 59                      | 65                      |\n| Interest expense                                                                             | 5,440                   | 8,882                   |\n| Net interest income                                                                          | 6,852                   | 7, 6 67                 |\n\n## 4.

Net fees and commiss/i.righton continued\n\nThe Group applies the following practical expedients:\n\n- \u00b7 Information on amounts of transaction price allocated to unsatisf/i.righted (or partially unsatisf/i.righted) performance obligat/i.rightons at the end of the reporting period is not disclosed as almost all fee-earning contracts have an expected duration of less than one year\n- \u00b7 Promised considerat/i.righton is not adjusted for the effects of a sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightng component as the period between the Group provid/i.rightng a service and the customer paying for it is expected to be less than one year\n- \u00b7 Incremental costs of obtain/i.rightng a fee-earning contract are recognised upfront in 'Fees and commiss/i.righton expense' rather than amortised, if the expected term of the contract is less than one year\n\nThe determinat/i.righton of the services performed for the customer, the transaction price, and when the services are completed depends on the nature of the product with the customer. The main considerat/i.rightons on income recognit/i.righton by product are as follows:\n\n## Transaction Banking\n\nThe Group recognises fee income associated with transactional trade and cash management at the point in time the service is provided. The Group recognises income associated with trade contingent risk exposures (such as letters of credit and guarantees) over the period in which the service is provided.\n\nPayment of fees is usually received at the same time the service is provided. In some cases, letters of credit and guarantees issued by the Group have annual upfront premiums, which are amortised on a straight-line basis to fee income over the year.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal Markets and Corporate Finance\n\nThe Group recognises fee income at the point in time the service is provided. Fee income is recognised for a sign/i.rightficant nonlending service when the transaction has been completed and the terms of the contract with the customer entitle the Group to the fee. Fees are usually received shortly after the service is provided.\n\nSyndicat/i.righton fees are recognised when the syndicat/i.righton is complete. Fees are generally received before completion of the syndicat/i.righton, or with/i.rightn 12 months of the transaction date.\n\nSecurit/i.rightes services include custody services, fund accounting and admin/i.rightstration, and broker clearing. Fees are recognised over the period the custody or fund management services are provided, or as and when broker services are requested.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nUpfront considerat/i.righton on bancassurance agreements is amortised straight-line over the contractual term. Commiss/i.rightons for bancassurance activ/i.rightties are recorded as they are earned through sales of third-party insurance products to customers. These commiss/i.rightons are received with/i.rightn a short time frame of the commiss/i.righton being earned. Target-linked fees are accrued based on a percentage of the target achieved, provided it is assessed as highly probable that the target will be met. Cash payment is received at a contractually specif/i.righted date after achievement of a target has been confirmed.\n\nUpfront and trail/i.rightng commiss/i.rightons for managed investment placements are recorded as they are confirmed. Income from these activ/i.rightties is relatively even throughout the period, and cash is usually received with/i.rightn a short time frame after the commiss/i.righton is earned.\n\n## Retail Products\n\nThe Group recognises most income at the point in time the Group is entitled to the fee, since most services are provided at the time of the customer's request.\n\nCredit card annual fees are recognised at the time the fee is received since, in most of our retail markets, there are contractual circumstances under which fees are waived, so income recognit/i.righton is constrained until the uncertaint/i.rightes associated with the annual fee are resolved. The Group defers the fair value of reward points on its credit card reward programmes, and recognises income and costs associated with fulfill/i.rightng the reward at the time of redemption.\n\n|                                                                              | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Fees and commiss/i.rightons income                                           | 3,865                   | 4,111                   |\n| Of which:                                                                    |                         |                         |\n| Financ/i.rightal instruments that are not fair valued through profit or loss | 1,122                   | 1,495                   |\n| Trust and other fiduc/i.rightary activ/i.rightties                           | 254                     | 166                     |\n| Fees and commiss/i.rightons expense                                          | (705)                   | (589)                   |\n| Of which:                                                                    |                         |                         |\n| Financ/i.rightal instruments that are not fair valued through profit or loss | (219)                   | (138)                   |\n| Trust and other fiduc/i.rightary activ/i.rightties                           | (11)                    | (27)                    |\n| Net fees and commiss/i.righton                                               | 3,160                   | 3,522                   |",

Credit impa/i.rightrment\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group's expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions. The sign/i.rightficant judgements in determin/i.rightng expected credit loss include:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's criter/i.righta for assessing if there has been a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk;\n- \u00b7 Development of expected credit loss models, includ/i.rightng the choice of inputs relating to macroeconomic variables;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of management overlays and post-model adjustments;\n- \u00b7 Determinat/i.righton of probabil/i.rightty weight/i.rightngs for Stage 3 ind/i.rightvidually assessed provis/i.rightons\n\nThe calculation of credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons also involves expert credit judgement to be applied by the Credit Risk Management Team based upon counterparty informat/i.righton they receive from various sources includ/i.rightng relationsh/i.rightp managers and on external market informat/i.righton. Details on the approach for determin/i.rightng expected credit loss can be found in the Credit Risk section, under IFRS 9 Methodology (page 224).\n\nEstimates of forecasts of key macroeconomic variables underlying the expected credit loss calculation can be found with/i.rightn the Risk review, Key assumptions and judgements in determin/i.rightng expected credit loss (page 225).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nExpected credit losses are determined for all financ/i.rightal debt instruments that are classif/i.righted at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, undrawn commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees.\n\nAn expected credit loss represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a financ/i.rightal asset, undrawn commitment or financ/i.rightal guarantee.\n\nA cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive over the contractual life of the instrument.",

Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\n## Measurement\n\nExpected credit losses are computed as unbiased, probabil/i.rightty-weighted amounts which are determined by evaluating a range of reasonably possible outcomes, the time value of money, and consider/i.rightng all reasonable and supportable informat/i.righton includ/i.rightng that which is forward-looking.\n\nFor material portfolios, the estimate of expected cash shortfalls is determined by multiply/i.rightng the probabil/i.rightty of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). There may be multiple default events over the lifet/i.rightme of an instrument. Further details on the components of PD, LGD and EAD are disclosed in the Credit Risk section. For less material Retail Banking loan portfolios, the Group has adopted less sophist/i.rightcated approaches based on histor/i.rightcal roll rates or loss rates.\n\nForward-looking economic assumptions are incorporated into the PD, LGD and EAD where relevant and where they influence Credit Risk, such as GDP growth rates, interest rates, house price ind/i.rightces and commodity prices among others. These assumptions are incorporated using the Group's most likely forecast for a range of macroeconomic assumptions. These forecasts are determined using all reasonable and supportable informat/i.righton, which includes both internally developed forecasts and those available externally, and are consistent with those used for budgeting, forecasting and capital planning.\n\nTo account for the potential non-linear/i.rightty in credit losses, multiple forward-looking scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes for all material portfolios. For example, where there is a greater risk of downside credit losses than upside gains, multiple forward-looking economic scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in respect of determin/i.rightng the PD (and where relevant, the LGD and EAD) and in determin/i.rightng the overall expected credit loss amounts. These scenarios are determined using a Monte Carlo approach centred around the Group's most likely forecast of macroeconomic assumptions.\n\nThe period over which cash shortfalls are determined is generally lim/i.rightted to the maximum contractual period for which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk. However, for certain revolving credit facil/i.rightties, which include credit cards or overdrafts, the Group's exposure to Credit Risk is not lim/i.rightted to the contractual period. For these instruments, the Group estimates an appropriate life based on the period that the Group is exposed to Credit Risk, which includes the effect of Credit Risk management actions such as the withdrawal of undrawn facil/i.rightties.\n\nFor credit-impa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal instruments, the estimate of cash shortfalls may require the use of expert credit judgement.\n\nThe estimate of expected cash shortfalls on a collateralised financ/i.rightal instrument reflects the amount and tim/i.rightng of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collateral less the costs of obtain/i.rightng and selling the collateral, regardless of whether foreclosure is deemed probable.\n\nCash flows from unfunded credit enhancements held are included with/i.rightn the measurement of expected credit losses if they are part of, or integral to, the contractual terms of the instrument (this includes financ/i.rightal guarantees, unfunded risk partic/i.rightpations and other non-derivat/i.rightve credit insurance). Although non-integral credit enhancements do not impact the measurement of expected credit losses, a reimbursement asset is recognised to the extent of the expected credit losses recorded.\n\nCash shortfalls are discounted using the effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or orig/i.rightnated credit-impa/i.rightred instruments (POCI)) on the financ/i.rightal instrument as calculated at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton or if the instrument has a variable interest rate, the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.\n\n## Instruments\n\n## Location of expected credit loss provis/i.rightons\n\n| Financ/i.rightal assets held at amortised cost        | Loss provis/i.rightons: netted against gross carrying value 1     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financ/i.rightal assets held FVOCI - Debt instruments | Other comprehensive income (FVOCI expected credit loss reserve) 2 |\n| Loan commitments                                      | Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges 3     |\n| Financ/i.rightal guarantees                           | Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges 3     |\n\n- 2  Debt and treasury securit/i.rightes classif/i.righted as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are held at fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The expected credit loss attributed to these instruments is held as a separate reserve with/i.rightn other comprehensive income (OCI) and is recycled to the profit and loss account along with any fair value measurement gains or losses held with/i.rightn FVOCI when the applicable instruments are derecognised\n- 3 Expected credit loss on loan commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees is recognised as a liab/i.rightlity provis/i.righton. Where a financ/i.rightal instrument includes both a loan (i.e. financ/i.rightal asset component) and an undrawn commitment (i.e. loan commitment component), and it is not possible to separately ident/i.rightfy the expected credit loss on these components, expected credit loss amounts on the loan commitment are recognised together with expected credit loss amounts on the financ/i.rightal asset. To the extent the combined expected credit loss exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal asset, the expected credit loss is recognised as a liab/i.rightlity provis/i.righton\n\n## Recognit/i.righton\n\n12 months expected credit losses (stage 1) Expected credit losses are recognised at the time of in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton of a financ/i.rightal instrument and represent the lifet/i.rightme cash shortfalls aris/i.rightng from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. Expected credit losses continue to be determined on this basis until there is either a sign/i.rightficant increase in the Credit Risk of an instrument or the instrument becomes credit-impa/i.rightred. If an instrument is no longer considered to exhib/i.rightt a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk, expected credit losses will revert to being determined on a 12-month basis.",

Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\nSign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk (Stage 2) If a financ/i.rightal asset experiences a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, an expected credit loss provis/i.righton is recognised for default events that may occur over the lifet/i.rightme of the asset.\n\nSign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk is assessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at orig/i.rightnation (after taking into account the passage of time). Sign/i.rightficant does not mean statist/i.rightcally sign/i.rightficant nor is it assessed in the context of changes in expected credit loss. Whether a change in the risk of default is sign/i.rightficant or not is assessed using a number of quantitat/i.rightve and qualitat/i.rightve factors, the weight of which depends on the type of product and counterparty. Financ/i.rightal assets that are 30 or more days past due and not credit-impa/i.rightred will always be considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk. For less material portfolios where a loss rate or roll rate approach is applied to compute expected credit loss, sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk is primar/i.rightly based on 30 days past due.\n\nQuantitat/i.rightve factors include an assessment of whether there has been sign/i.rightficant increase in the forward-looking probabil/i.rightty of default (PD) since orig/i.rightnation. A forward-looking PD is one that is adjusted for future economic condit/i.rightons to the extent these are correlated to changes in Credit Risk. We compare the residual lifet/i.rightme PD at the balance sheet date to the residual lifet/i.rightme PD that was expected at the time of orig/i.rightnation for the same point in the term structure and determine whether both the absolute and relative change between the two exceeds predetermined thresholds. To the extent that the differences between the measures of default outlined exceed the defined thresholds, the instrument is considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk.\n\nQualitat/i.rightve factors assessed include those linked to current Credit Risk management processes, such as lending placed on non-purely precautionary early alert (and subject to closer monitor/i.rightng).\n\nA non-purely precautionary early alert account is one which exhib/i.rightts risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requir/i.rightng closer monitor/i.rightng, supervis/i.righton, or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deteriorat/i.righton of repayment prospects and the likel/i.righthood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of posit/i.righton with/i.rightn the industry, concerns over management's abil/i.rightty to manage operations, weak/ deteriorat/i.rightng operating results, liqu/i.rightdity strain and overdue balances among other factors.\n\nCredit-impa/i.rightred (or defaulted) exposures (Stage 3) Financ/i.rightal assets that are credit-impa/i.rightred (or in default) represent those that are at least 90 days past due in respect of princ/i.rightpal and/or interest. Financ/i.rightal assets are also considered to be credit-impa/i.rightred where the obligors are unlikely to pay on the occurrence of one or more observable events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financ/i.rightal asset. It may not be possible to ident/i.rightfy a single discrete event but instead the combined effect of several events may cause financ/i.rightal assets to become credit-impa/i.rightred.\n\nEvidence that a financ/i.rightal asset is credit-impa/i.rightred includes observable data about the following events:\n\n- \u00b7 Sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculty of the issuer or borrower;\n- \u00b7 Breach of contract such as default or a past due event;\n- \u00b7 For economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculty, the lenders of the borrower have granted the borrower concession/s that lenders would not otherwise consider. This would include forbearance actions (page 319);\n- \u00b7 Pending or actual bankruptcy or other financ/i.rightal reorganisat/i.righton to avoid or delay discharge of the borrower's obligat/i.righton/s;\n- \u00b7 The disappearance of an active market for the applicable financ/i.rightal asset due to financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculties of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 Purchase or orig/i.rightnation of a financ/i.rightal asset at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses\n\nLending commitments to a credit-impa/i.rightred obligor that have not yet been drawn down are included to the extent that the commitment cannot be withdrawn. Loss provis/i.rightons against credit-impa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal assets are determined based on an assessment of the recoverable cash flows under a range of scenarios, includ/i.rightng the realisat/i.righton of any collateral held where appropriate. The loss provis/i.rightons held represent the difference between the present value of the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at the instrument's orig/i.rightnal effective interest rate, and the gross carrying value (includ/i.rightng contractual interest due but not paid) of the instrument prior to any credit impa/i.rightrment. The Group's defin/i.righttion of default is aligned with the regulatory defin/i.righttion of default as set out in European Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR178) and related guidel/i.rightnes.",

Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\n## Expert credit judgement\n\nFor Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal, Commercial and Private Banking, borrowers are graded by Credit Risk management on a credit grading (CG) scale from CG1 to CG14. Once a borrower starts to exhib/i.rightt credit deteriorat/i.righton, it will move along the credit grading scale in the performing book and when it is classif/i.righted as CG12 the credit assessment and oversight of the loan will normally be performed by Group Special Assets Management (GSAM).\n\nBorrowers graded CG12 exhib/i.rightt well-defined weaknesses in areas such as management and/or performance but there is no current expectation of a loss of princ/i.rightpal or interest. Where the impa/i.rightrment assessment ind/i.rightcates that there will be a loss of princ/i.rightpal on a loan, the borrower is graded a CG14 while borrowers of other credit-impa/i.rightred loans are graded CG13. Instruments graded CG13 or CG14 are regarded as stage 3.\n\nFor ind/i.rightvidually sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightal assets with/i.rightn stage 3, GSAM will consider all judgements that have an impact on the expected future cash flows of the asset. These include: the business prospects, industry and geopolit/i.rightcal climate of the customer, quality of realisable value of collateral, the Group's legal posit/i.righton relative to other claimants and any renegotiat/i.righton/forbearance/modif/i.rightcation options. The future cash flow calculation involves sign/i.rightficant judgements and estimates. As new informat/i.righton becomes available and further negotiat/i.rightons/forbearance measures are taken, the estimates of the future cash flows will be revised, and will have an impact on the future cash flow analysis.\n\nFor financ/i.rightal assets which are not ind/i.rightvidually sign/i.rightficant, such as the Retail Banking portfolio or small business loans, which comprise a large number of homogenous loans that share sim/i.rightlar characterist/i.rightcs, statist/i.rightcal estimates and techniques are used, as well as credit scoring analysis.\n\nRetail Banking clients are considered credit-impa/i.rightred where they are more than 90 days past due. Retail Banking products are also considered credit-impa/i.rightred if the borrower files for bankruptcy or other forbearance programme, the borrower is deceased or the business is closed in the case of a small business, or if the borrower surrenders the collateral, or there is an ident/i.rightfied fraud on the account. Addit/i.rightonally, if the account is unsecured and the borrower has other credit accounts with the Group that are considered credit-impa/i.rightred, the account may be also be credit-impa/i.rightred.\n\nTechniques used to compute impa/i.rightrment amounts use models which analyse histor/i.rightcal repayment and default rates over a time horizon. Where various models are used, judgement is required to analyse the available informat/i.righton provided and select the appropriate model or combinat/i.righton of models to use.\n\nExpert credit judgement is also applied to determine whether any post-model adjustments are required for Credit Risk elements which are not captured by the models.\n\n## Modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nWhere the orig/i.rightnal contractual terms of a financ/i.rightal asset have been modif/i.righted for credit reasons and the instrument has not been derecognised (an instrument is derecognised when a modif/i.rightcation results in a change in cash flows that the Group would consider substantial), the resulting modif/i.rightcation loss is recognised with/i.rightn credit impa/i.rightrment in the income statement with a corresponding decrease in the gross carrying value of the asset. If the modif/i.rightcation involved a concession that the bank would not otherwise consider, the instrument is considered to be credit-impa/i.rightred and is considered forborne.\n\nExpected credit loss for modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal assets that have not been derecognised and are not considered to be creditimpa/i.rightred will be recognised on a 12-month basis, or a lifet/i.rightme basis, if there is a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk. These assets are assessed (by comparison to the orig/i.rightnation date) to determine whether there has been a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk subsequent to the modif/i.rightcation. Although loans may be modif/i.righted for non-credit reasons, a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk may occur. In addit/i.righton to the recognit/i.righton of modif/i.rightcation gains and losses, the revised carrying value of modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal assets will impact the calculation of expected credit losses, with any increase or decrease in expected credit loss recognised with/i.rightn impa/i.rightrment.\n\n## Forborne loans\n\nForborne loans are those loans that have been modif/i.righted in response to a customer's financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculties. Forbearance strategies assist clients who are temporarily in financ/i.rightal distress and are unable to meet their orig/i.rightnal contractual repayment terms. Forbearance can be in/i.righttiated by the client, the Group or a third-party includ/i.rightng government-sponsored programmes or a conglomerate of credit inst/i.righttutions. Forbearance may include debt restructuring such as new repayment schedules, payment deferrals, tenor extensions, interest-only payments, lower interest rates, forgiveness of princ/i.rightpal, interest or fees, or relaxation of loan covenants.\n\nForborne loans that have been modif/i.righted (and not derecognised) on terms that are not consistent with those readily available in the market and/or where we have granted a concession compared to the orig/i.rightnal terms of the loans are considered credit-impa/i.rightred if there is a detrimental impact on cash flows. The modif/i.rightcation loss (see Classif/i.rightcation and measurement - Modif/i.rightcations) is recognised in the profit or loss with/i.rightn credit impa/i.rightrment and the gross carrying value of the loan reduced by the same amount. The modif/i.righted loan is disclosed as 'Loans subject to forbearance - credit-impa/i.rightred'.\n\nLoans that have been subject to a forbearance modif/i.rightcation, but which are not considered credit-impa/i.rightred (not classif/i.righted as CG13 or CG14), are disclosed as 'Forborne - not credit-impa/i.rightred'. This may include amendments to covenants with/i.rightn the contractual terms.",

Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\n## Write-offs of credit-impa/i.rightred instruments and reversal of impa/i.rightrment\n\nTo the extent a financ/i.rightal debt instrument is considered irrecoverable, the applicable portion of the gross carrying value is written off against the related loan provis/i.righton. Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed, it is decided that there is no realist/i.rightc probabil/i.rightty of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of the provis/i.righton for credit impa/i.rightrment in the income statement.\n\n## Loss provis/i.rightons on purchased or orig/i.rightnated credit-impa/i.rightred instruments (POCI)\n\nThe Group measures expected credit loss on a lifet/i.rightme basis for POCI instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, expected credit loss is not recognised in a separate loss provis/i.righton on in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton for POCI instruments as the lifet/i.rightme expected credit loss is inherent with/i.rightn the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Group recognises the change in lifet/i.rightme expected credit losses aris/i.rightng subsequent to in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton in the income statement and the cumulative change as a loss provis/i.righton. Where lifet/i.rightme expected credit losses on POCI instruments are less than those at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, then the favourable differences are recognised as impa/i.rightrment gains in the income statement (and as impa/i.rightrment loss where the expected credit losses are greater).\n\n## Improvement in Credit Risk/curing\n\nA period may elapse from the point at which instruments enter lifet/i.rightme expected credit losses (stage 2 or stage 3) and are reclassif/i.righted back to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1). For financ/i.rightal assets that are credit-impa/i.rightred (stage 3), a transfer to stage 2 or stage 1 is only permitted where the instrument is no longer considered to be credit-impa/i.rightred. An instrument will no longer be considered credit-impa/i.rightred when there is no shortfall of cash flows compared to the orig/i.rightnal contractual terms.\n\nFor financ/i.rightal assets with/i.rightn stage 2, these can only be transferred to stage 1 when they are no longer considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk.\n\nWhere sign/i.rightficant increase in Credit Risk was determined using quantitat/i.rightve measures, the instruments will automatically transfer back to stage 1 when the orig/i.rightnal PD-based transfer criter/i.righta are no longer met. Where instruments were transferred to stage 2 due to an assessment of qualitat/i.rightve factors, the issues that led to the reclassif/i.rightcation must be cured before the instruments can be reclassif/i.righted to stage 1. This includes instances where management actions led to instruments being classif/i.righted as stage 2, requir/i.rightng that action to be resolved before loans are reclassif/i.righted to stage 1.\n\nA forborne loan can only be removed from being disclosed as forborne if the loan is performing (stage 1 or 2) and a further two-year probation period is met.\n\nIn order for a forborne loan to become performing, the following criter/i.righta have to be satisf/i.righted:\n\n- \u00b7 At least a year has passed with no default based upon the forborne contract terms\n- \u00b7 The customer is likely to repay its obligat/i.rightons in full without realis/i.rightng security\n- \u00b7 The customer has no accumulated impa/i.rightrment against amount outstanding (except for expected credit loss)\n\nSubsequent to the criter/i.righta above, a further two-year probation period has to be fulfilled, whereby regular payments are made by the customer and none of the exposures to the customer are more than 30 days past due.\n\n|                                                                                           | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |   2019  $mill/i.righton |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment on loans and advances to banks and customers                 | 2,191                   |                     856 |\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment on debt securit/i.rightes                                    | 33                      |                       9 |\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment relating to financ/i.rightal guarantees and loan commitments | 103                     |                      35 |\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment relating to other financ/i.rightal assets                    | (2)                     |                       8 |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment 1                                                                | 2,325                   |                     908 |\n\n## 9.

Taxation\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nIncome tax payable on profits is based on the applicable tax law in each jur/i.rightsdict/i.righton and is recognised as an expense in the period in which profits arise.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences aris/i.rightng between the tax bases of assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financ/i.rightal statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date, and that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liab/i.rightlity is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be util/i.rightsed. Where permitted, deferred tax assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are offset on an entity basis and not by component of deferred taxation.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax relating to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, is credited or charged directly to equity and is subsequently recognised in the income statement together with the current or deferred gain or loss.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\n- \u00b7 Determin/i.rightng the Group's tax charge for the year involves estimat/i.righton and judgement, which includes an interpretat/i.righton of local tax laws and an assessment of whether the tax authorit/i.rightes will accept the posit/i.righton taken. These judgements take account of external advice where appropriate, and the Group's view on settling with the relevant tax authorit/i.rightes\n- \u00b7 The Group provides for current tax liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid to the tax authorit/i.rightes where an outflow is probable. In making its estimates the Group assumes that the tax authorit/i.rightes will examine all the amounts reported to them and have full knowledge of all relevant informat/i.righton\n- \u00b7 The recoverabil/i.rightty of the Group's deferred tax assets is based on management's judgement of the availab/i.rightlity of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets will be util/i.rightsed\n\nThe following table provides analysis of taxation charge in the year:\n\n|                                                                            | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| The charge for taxation based upon the profit for the year comprises:      |                         |                         |\n| Current tax:                                                               |                         |                         |\n| United Kingdom corporation tax at 19 per cent (2019:19 per cent):          |                         |                         |\n| Current tax charge on income for the year                                  | -                       | -                       |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years (includ/i.rightng double tax relief) | (41)                    | (6)                     |\n| Foreign tax:                                                               |                         |                         |\n| Current tax charge on income for the year                                  | 1,061                   | 1,427                   |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                                      | (352)                   | 1                       |\n|                                                                            | 668                     | 1,422                   |\n| Deferred tax:                                                              |                         |                         |\n| Orig/i.rightnation/reversal of temporary differences                       | (193)                   | 22                      |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                                      | 387                     | (71)                    |\n|                                                                            | 194                     | (49)                    |\n| Tax on profits on ordinary activ/i.rightties                               | 862                     | 1,373                   |\n| Effective tax rate                                                         | 53.4%                   | 37.0%                   |\n\nThe tax charge for the year of $862 mill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $1,373 mill/i.righton) on a profit before tax of $1,613 mill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $3,713 mill/i.righton) reflects the impact of non-deductible expenses, non-deductible goodwill impa/i.rightrment and the impact of countries with tax rates higher or lower than the UK, the most sign/i.rightficant of which is India.

The Group does not currently consider that assumptions or judgements made in assessing tax liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes have a sign/i.rightficant risk of resulting in a material adjustment with/i.rightn the next financ/i.rightal year.\n\n|                                                                      | 2020                         | 2020                          | 2020                   | 2019                         | 2019                          | 2019                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Tax recognised in other   comprehensive income                       | Current tax  $mill/i.righton | Deferred tax  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Current tax  $mill/i.righton | Deferred tax  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Items that will not be reclassif/i.righted to  income statement      | -                            | (17)                          | (17)                   | 15                           | 27                            | 42                     |\n| Own credit adjustment                                                | -                            | 1                             | 1                      | 17                           | 35                            | 52                     |\n| Equity instruments at fair value through  other comprehensive income | -                            | (27)                          | (27)                   | 5                            | (10)                          | (5)                    |\n| Retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons                                | -                            | 9                             | 9                      | (7)                          | 2                             | (5)                    |\n| Items that may be reclassed  subsequently to income statement        | (1)                          | (53)                          | (54)                   | 2                            | (50)                          | (48)                   |\n| Debt instruments at fair value through  other comprehensive income   | (1)                          | (68)                          | (69)                   | 2                            | (44)                          | (42)                   |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                     | -                            | 15                            | 15                     | -                            | (6)                           | (6)                    |\n| Total tax credit/(charge) recognised  in/uni00A0equity               | (1)                          | (70)                          | (71)                   | 17                           | (23)                          | (6)                    |",

The recoverabil/i.rightty of the Group's deferred tax assets is based on management's judgement of the availab/i.rightlity of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets will be util/i.rightsed.\n\nOf the Group's total deferred tax assets, $282 mill/i.righton relates to tax losses carried forward. These tax losses have arisen in ind/i.rightvidual legal entit/i.rightes and will be offset as future taxable profits arise in those entit/i.rightes.\n\n- \u00b7 $129 mill/i.righton of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in Ireland, where there is no expiry date for unused tax losses. These losses relate to aircraft leasing and are expected to be fully util/i.rightsed over the useful economical life of the assets being up to 18 years\n- \u00b7 $92 mill/i.righton of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in the US. Management forecasts show that the losses are expected to be fully util/i.rightsed over a period of five years.\n\nThe remain/i.rightng deferred tax assets of $61 mill/i.righton relating to losses have arisen in other jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons and are expected to be recovered in less than 10 years.\n\n|                                                                                                       | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| No account has been taken of the following potential deferred tax assets/(liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes): |                         |                         |\n| Withhold/i.rightng tax on unremitted earnings from overseas subsid/i.rightaries                       | (315)                   | (230)                   |\n| Tax losses                                                                                            | 1,597                   | 1,297                   |\n| Held-over gains on incorporation of overseas branches                                                 | (336)                   | (410)                   |\n| Other temporary differences                                                                           | 160                     | 83                      |",

Earnings per ordinary share\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by div/i.rightding the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by div/i.rightding the basic earnings, which require no adjustment for the effects of dilut/i.rightve potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilut/i.rightve potential ordinary shares, excluding own shares held.\n\nThe Group also measures earnings per share on an underlying basis. This differs from earnings defined in IAS 33 Earnings per share. Underlying earnings is profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature; amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent; and other infrequent and/or exceptional transactions that are sign/i.rightficant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period.\n\nThe table below provides the basis of underlying earnings.\n\n|                                                                                  | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Profit for the period attributable to equity holders                             | 751                     | 2,340                   |\n| Non-controlling interest                                                         | (27)                    | (37)                    |\n| Div/i.rightdend payable on preference shares and AT1 classif/i.righted as equity | (395)                   | (448)                   |\n| Profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders                      | 329                     | 1,855                   |\n| Items normalised:                                                                |                         |                         |\n| Provis/i.righton for regulatory matters                                          | (14)                    | 226                     |\n| Restructuring                                                                    | 382                     | 254                     |\n| Profit from jo/i.rightnt venture                                                 | -                       | (48)                    |\n| Goodwill impa/i.rightrment (Note 9)                                              | 489                     | 27                      |\n| Net loss on sale of businesses (Note 6)                                          | 38                      | -                       |\n| Tax on normalised items 1                                                        | (83)                    | 152                     |\n| Underlying profit                                                                | 1,141                   | 2,466                   |\n| Basic - Weighted average number of shares (mill/i.rightons)                      | 3,160                   | 3,256                   |\n| Diluted - Weighted average number of shares (mill/i.rightons)                    | 3,199                   | 3,290                   |\n| Basic earnings per ordinary share (cents)                                        | 10.4                    | 57.0                    |\n| Diluted earnings per ordinary share (cents)                                      | 10.3                    | 56.4                    |\n| Underlying basic earnings per ordinary share (cents)                             | 36.1                    | 75.7                    |\n| Underlying diluted earnings per ordinary share (cents)                           | 35.7                    | 75.0                    |\n\n- 1 No tax is included in respect of the impa/i.rightrment of goodwill as no tax relief is available",

Financ/i.rightal instruments\n\n## Classif/i.rightcation and measurement\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group classif/i.rightes its financ/i.rightal assets into the following measurement categories: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and fair value through profit or loss. Financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are classif/i.righted as either amortised cost, or held at fair value through profit or loss. Management determines the classif/i.rightcation of its financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton of the instrument or, where applicable, at the time of reclassif/i.rightcation.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets held at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nDebt instruments held at amortised cost or held at FVOCI have contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of princ/i.rightpal and interest (SPPI) characterist/i.rightcs. Princ/i.rightpal is the fair value of the financ/i.rightal asset at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton but this may change over the life of the instrument as amounts are repaid. Interest consists of considerat/i.righton for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the princ/i.rightpal amount outstanding during a particular period and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows have SPPI characterist/i.rightcs, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financ/i.rightal asset contains a contractual term that could change the tim/i.rightng or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condit/i.righton. In making the assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 Contingent events that would change the amount and tim/i.rightng of cash flows\n- \u00b7 Leverage features\n- \u00b7 Prepayment and extension terms\n- \u00b7 Terms that lim/i.rightt the Group's claim to cash flows from specif/i.righted assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements)\n- \u00b7 Features that modify considerat/i.righton of the time value of money - e.g. period/i.rightcal reset of interest rates\n\nWhether financ/i.rightal assets are held at amortised cost or at FVOCI depend on the object/i.rightves of the business models under which the assets are held. A business model refers to how the Group manages financ/i.rightal assets to generate cash flows.\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the object/i.rightve of a business model in which an asset is held at the ind/i.rightvidual product business line, and where applicable with/i.rightn business lines depending on the way the business is managed and informat/i.righton is provided to management. Factors considered include:\n\n- \u00b7 How the performance of the product business line is evaluated and reported to the Group's management\n- \u00b7 How managers of the business model are compensated, includ/i.rightng whether management is compensated based on the fair value of assets or the contractual cash flows collected\n- \u00b7 The risks that affect the performance of the business model and how those risks are managed\n- \u00b7 The frequency, volume and tim/i.rightng of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activ/i.rightty\n\nThe Group's business model assessment is as follows:\n\n| Business model                      | Business object/i.rightve                                                                                                                                    | Characterist/i.rightcs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Businesses                                                                                                                      | Products                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hold to  collect                    | Intent is to orig/i.rightnate  financ/i.rightal assets and  hold them to maturity,  collecting the  contractual cash flows  over the term of the  instrument | \u00b7  Provid/i.rightng financ/i.rightng and  orig/i.rightnating assets to earn interest  income as primary income stream \u00b7  Performing credit risk  management activ/i.rightties \u00b7  Costs include funding costs,  transaction costs and impa/i.rightrment  losses                                                                                         | \u00b7  Corporate Lending \u00b7  Corporate Finance \u00b7  Transaction Banking \u00b7  Retail Lending \u00b7  Treasury Markets  (Loans and  Borrowings) | \u00b7  Loans and advances \u00b7  Debt securit/i.rightes                                        |\n| Hold to  collect and  sell          | Business object/i.rightve met  through both hold to  collect and by selling  financ/i.rightal assets                                                         | \u00b7  Portfolios held for liqu/i.rightdity needs;  or where a certain interest yield  profile is mainta/i.rightned; or that are  normally rebalanced to achieve  matching of duration of assets                                                                                                                                                           | \u00b7  Treasury Markets                                                                                                             | \u00b7  Derivat/i.rightves \u00b7  Debt securit/i.rightes                                        |\n| Fair value  through  profit or loss | All other business  object/i.rightves, includ/i.rightng  trading and managing  financ/i.rightal assets on a fair  value basis                                | interest income, fair value  changes, and impa/i.rightrment losses \u00b7  Assets held for trading \u00b7  Assets that are orig/i.rightnated,  purchased, and sold for profit  taking or underwrit/i.rightng activ/i.rightty \u00b7  Performance of the portfolio is  evaluated on a fair value basis \u00b7  Income streams are from fair  value changes or trading gains | \u00b7  Financ/i.rightal Markets \u00b7  Syndicat/i.righton \u00b7  All other business lines                                                   | \u00b7  Derivat/i.rightves \u00b7  Trading portfolios \u00b7  Financ/i.rightal Markets  reverse repos |",

Conversely, financ/i.rightal assets which have SPPI characterist/i.rightcs but are held with/i.rightn a business model whose object/i.rightve is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financ/i.rightal assets ('Hold to collect and sell') are classif/i.righted as held at FVOCI.\n\nBoth hold to collect business and a hold to collect and sell business model involve holding financ/i.rightal assets to collect the contractual cash flows. However, the business models are dist/i.rightnct by reference to the frequency and sign/i.rightficance that asset sales play in meeting the object/i.rightve under which a particular group of financ/i.rightal assets is managed. Hold to collect business models are characterised by asset sales that are inc/i.rightdental to meeting the object/i.rightves under which a group of assets is managed. Sales of assets under a hold to collect business model can be made to manage increases in the credit risk of financ/i.rightal assets but sales for other reasons should be infrequent or ins/i.rightgnif/i.rightcant.\n\nCash flows from the sale of financ/i.rightal assets under a hold to collect and sell business model by contrast are integral to achiev/i.rightng the object/i.rightves under which a particular group of financ/i.rightal assets are managed. This may be the case where frequent sales of financ/i.rightal assets are required to manage the Group's daily liqu/i.rightdity requirements or to meet regulatory requirements to demonstrate liqu/i.rightdity of financ/i.rightal instruments. Sales of assets under hold to collect and sell business models are therefore both more frequent and more sign/i.rightficant in value than those under the hold to collect model.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as held at FVOCI\n\nNon-trading equity instruments acquired for strategic purposes rather than capital gain may be irrevocably designated at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton as held at FVOCI on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Div/i.rightdends received are recognised in profit or loss. Gains and losses aris/i.rightng from changes in the fair value of these instruments, includ/i.rightng foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised directly in equity and are never reclassif/i.righted to profit or loss even on derecognit/i.righton.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets which are not held at amortised cost or that are not held at FVOCI are held at fair value through profit or loss. Financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at fair value through profit or loss are either mandatorily classif/i.righted fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton.\n\n## Mandatorily classif/i.righted at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes which are mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss are split between two subcategories as follows:\n\n## Trading, includ/i.rightng:\n\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held for trading, which are those acquired princ/i.rightpally for the purpose of selling in the short-term\n- \u00b7 Derivat/i.rightves\n\nNon-trading mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss, includ/i.rightng:\n\n- \u00b7 Instruments in a business which has a fair value business model (see the Group's business model assessment) which are not trading or derivat/i.rightves;\n- \u00b7 Hybrid financ/i.rightal assets that contain one or more embedded derivat/i.rightves;\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal assets that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI but which do not have SPPI characterist/i.rightcs;\n- \u00b7 Equity instruments that have not been designated as held at FVOCI\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes that constitute contingent considerat/i.righton in a business combinat/i.righton",

To sign/i.rightficantly reduce the accounting mismatch between assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and measurement bases, these debt securit/i.rightes have been designated at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nSim/i.rightlarly, to reduce accounting mismatches, the Group has designated certain financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at fair value through profit or loss where the liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes either:\n\n- \u00b7 Have fixed rates of interest and interest rate swaps or other interest rate derivat/i.rightves have been entered with the intent/i.righton of sign/i.rightficantly reducing interest rate risk; or\n- \u00b7 Are exposed to foreign currency risk and derivat/i.rightves have been acquired with the intent/i.righton of sign/i.rightficantly reducing exposure to market changes; or\n- \u00b7 Have been acquired to fund trading asset portfolios or assets\n\nFinanc/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes may also be designated at fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis or have a embedded derivat/i.rightve where the Group is not able to bifurcate and separately value the embedded derivat/i.rightve component.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost\n\nFinanc/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes that are not financ/i.rightal guarantees or loan commitments and that are not classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at fair value through profit or loss are classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost.\n\nPreference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a specif/i.rightc date or at the option of the shareholder are classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and are presented in other borrowed funds. The div/i.rightdends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Group issues financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are in/i.righttially recognised at their fair value as a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity, and subsequently measured at the higher of the in/i.righttial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the princ/i.rightples of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and their expected credit loss provis/i.righton. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held.\n\n## Fair value of financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liab/i.rightlity in an orderly transaction between market partic/i.rightpants at the measurement date in the princ/i.rightpal market for the asset or liab/i.rightlity, or in the absence of a princ/i.rightpal market, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at the date. The fair value of a liab/i.rightlity includes the risk that the bank will not be able to honour its obligat/i.rightons.\n\nThe fair value of financ/i.rightal instruments is generally measured on the basis of the ind/i.rightvidual financ/i.rightal instrument. However, when a group of financ/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risk or credit risk, the fair value of the group of financ/i.rightal instruments is measured on a net basis.\n\nThe fair values of quoted financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liab/i.rightlity take place with suffic/i.rightent frequency and volume to provide pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton on an ongoing basis. If the market for a financ/i.rightal instrument, and for unlisted securit/i.rightes, is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.",

Loans and advances and other financ/i.rightal assets held at amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date (the date on which cash is advanced to the borrowers).\n\nAll financ/i.rightal instruments are in/i.righttially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for financ/i.rightal assets which are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the in/i.righttial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognit/i.righton of profits or losses at the time of in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton. However, these profits or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based solely on observable market data. In those cases where the in/i.righttially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses unobservable inputs, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immed/i.rightately in the income statement but is amortised or released to the income statement as the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (see Interest income and expense). Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere a financ/i.rightal instrument carried at amortised cost is the hedged item in a qualify/i.rightng fair value hedge relationsh/i.rightp, its carrying value is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets held at FVOCI\n\nDebt instruments held at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised gains and losses aris/i.rightng from changes in fair value (includ/i.rightng any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. Foreign exchange gains and losses on the amortised cost are recognised in income. Changes in expected credit losses are recognised in the profit or loss and are accumulated in equity. On derecognit/i.righton, the cumulative fair value gains or losses, net of the cumulative expected credit loss reserve, are transferred to the profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments designated at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value with all unrealised gains and losses aris/i.rightng from changes in fair value (includ/i.rightng any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.

If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the Group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Group's continu/i.rightng involvement.\n\nWhere financ/i.rightal assets have been modif/i.righted, the modif/i.righted terms are assessed on a qualitat/i.rightve and quantitat/i.rightve basis to determine whether a fundamental change in the nature of the instrument has occurred, such as whether the derecognit/i.righton of the pre-exist/i.rightng instrument and the recognit/i.righton of a new instrument is appropriate.\n\nOn derecognit/i.righton of a financ/i.rightal asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of the considerat/i.righton received (includ/i.rightng any new asset obtained less any new liab/i.rightlity assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss except for equity instruments elected FVOCI (see above) and cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liab/i.rightlity that are held in other comprehensive income.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are derecognised when they are extingu/i.rightshed. A financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity is extingu/i.rightshed when the obligat/i.righton is discharged, cancelled or expires and this is evaluated both qualitat/i.rightvely and quantitat/i.rightvely. However, where a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity has been modif/i.righted, it is derecognised if the difference between the modif/i.righted cash flows and the orig/i.rightnal cash flows is more than 10 per cent, or if less than 10 per cent, the Group will perform a qualitat/i.rightve assessment to determine whether the terms of the two instruments are substantially different.\n\nIf the Group purchases its own debt, it is derecognised and the difference between the carrying amount of the liab/i.rightlity and the considerat/i.righton paid is included in 'Other income' except for the cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liab/i.rightlity that are held in other comprehensive income which are never recycled to the profit or loss.\n\n## Modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes whose orig/i.rightnal contractual terms have been modif/i.righted, includ/i.rightng those loans subject to forbearance strategies, are considered to be modif/i.righted instruments. Modif/i.rightcations may include changes to the tenor, cash flows and or interest rates among other factors.\n\nWhere derecognit/i.righton of financ/i.rightal assets is appropriate (see Derecognit/i.righton), the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classif/i.righted as purchased or orig/i.rightnated credit-impa/i.rightred assets (POCI).\n\nWhere derecognit/i.righton is not appropriate, the gross carrying amount of the applicable instruments is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modif/i.righted contractual cash flows discounted at the orig/i.rightnal effective interest rate (or credit adjusted effective interest rate for POCI financ/i.rightal assets). The difference between the recalculated values and the pre-modif/i.righted gross carrying values of the instruments are recorded as a modif/i.rightcation gain or loss in the profit or loss.\n\nGains and losses aris/i.rightng from modif/i.rightcations for credit reasons are recorded as part of 'Credit impa/i.rightrment' (see Credit Impairment Policy). Modif/i.rightcation gains and losses aris/i.rightng for non-credit reasons are recognised either as part of 'Credit impa/i.rightrment' or with/i.rightn income depending on whether there has been a change in the credit risk on the financ/i.rightal asset subsequent to the modif/i.rightcation. Modif/i.rightcation gains and losses aris/i.rightng on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are recognised with/i.rightn income.

Where the instrument is measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, this results in a change in the instrument's effective interest rate, with no change in the amortised cost value of the instrument. If the change to the instrument does not meet these criter/i.righta, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the changes are substantial and if they are, the financ/i.rightal instrument is derecognised and a new financ/i.rightal instrument is recognised. If the changes are not substantial, the Group adjusts the gross carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal instrument by the present value of the changes not covered by the practical expedient, discounted using the revised effective interest rate.",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe Group has elected to early-adopt the 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2' amendments to IFRS for the year ending 31 December 2020, which apply to a financ/i.rightal instrument when its benchmark interest rate, such as USD LIBOR, is either replaced with an alternative risk-free rate (RFR) or the benchmark itself is reformed so that it depends on actual market transactions instead of panel bank submiss/i.rightons. Please refer to the accounting policy for modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal instruments on page 331 which explains how the Group accounts for changes to a financ/i.rightal instrument as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe Group also applies the 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1' amendments, and the Phase 2 reliefs contain addit/i.rightonal reliefs for hedge accounting. These are discussed in Note 14.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 the Group had the following notional princ/i.rightpal exposures to interest rate benchmarks that are expected to be subject to interest rate benchmark reform. The Group has excluded financ/i.rightal instruments maturing before 31 December 2021 as it is assumed that these will not require reform, due to the expectation that the IBOR benchmarks the Group is exposed to will be published until at least this date.\n\n| IBOR exposures by  benchmark                                     | USD LIBOR  $mill/i.righton   | EUR LIBOR  $mill/i.righton   | GBP LIBOR  $mill/i.righton   | JPY LIBOR  $mill/i.righton   | CHF LIBOR  $mill/i.righton   | EONIA  $mill/i.righton   | SGD SOR  $mill/i.righton   | THB FIX  $mill/i.righton   | Total IBOR  $mill/i.righton   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Assets                                                           |                              |                              |                              |                              |                              |                          |                            |                            |                               |\n| Loans and advances to banks                                      | 1,072                        | -

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Offsetting of financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intent/i.righton to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liab/i.rightlity simultaneously.\n\nIn practice, for credit mit/i.rightgation, the Group is able to offset assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes which do not meet the IAS 32 netting criter/i.righta set out below. Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivat/i.rightves and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset but only in the event of default or other predetermined events.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivat/i.rightve transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a default.

The financ/i.rightal impact of the revis/i.righton in methodology is a loss of $56 mill/i.righton in net trading income and a loss in other comprehensive income of $78 mill/i.righton. These impacts are treated as a change in accounting estimate.\n\nThe net fair value loss on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss was $247 mill/i.righton for the year (31 December 2019: net loss of $1,602 mill/i.righton). Further details of the Group's own credit adjustment (OCA) valuation technique is described later in this Note.\n\n## Valuation of financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nThe fair values of quoted financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liab/i.rightlity take place with suffic/i.rightent frequency and volume to provide pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton on an ongoing basis. Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for ident/i.rightcal instruments held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liqu/i.rightdity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pric/i.rightng models and, where appropriate, comparison with instruments that have characterist/i.rightcs sim/i.rightlar to those of the instruments held by the Group.\n\nThe Valuation Control function is responsible for independent price verif/i.rightcation, oversight of fair value and appropriate value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues. Independent price verif/i.rightcation is the process of determin/i.rightng that the valuations incorporated into the financ/i.rightal statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product. The Valuation Control function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure the financ/i.rightal instruments are priced to exit. These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financ/i.rightal statements. The market data used for price verif/i.rightcation may include data sourced from recent trade data involv/i.rightng external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pric/i.rightng providers. Valuation Control performs a semi-annual review of the suitab/i.rightlity of the market data used for price testing. Price verif/i.rightcation uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in. To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliab/i.rightlity, availab/i.rightlity of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pric/i.rightng provider are taken into considerat/i.righton.\n\nThe Valuation and Benchmarks Committee (VBC) is the valuation governance forum consist/i.rightng of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Control and the business, which meets monthly to discuss and approve the independent valuations of the inventory. For Princ/i.rightpal Finance, the Investment Committee meeting is held on a quarterly basis to review investments and valuations.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group evaluates the sign/i.rightficance of financ/i.rightal instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financ/i.rightal statements as they involve a high degree of judgement and estimat/i.righton uncertainty in determin/i.rightng the carrying values of financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at the balance sheet date.\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financ/i.rightal instruments is determined using valuation techniques and estimates (see below) which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Changes in the observabil/i.rightty of sign/i.rightficant valuation inputs can materially affect the fair values of financ/i.rightal instruments\n- \u00b7 When establish/i.rightng the exit price of a financ/i.rightal instrument using a valuation technique, the Group estimates valuation adjustments in determin/i.rightng the fair value (page 339)\n- \u00b7 In determin/i.rightng the valuation of financ/i.rightal instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the sign/i.rightficant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments (page 341)\n- \u00b7 Where the estimated measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that use a sign/i.rightficant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nRefer to the fair value hierarchy explanation - Level 1, 2 and 3 (page 341)\n\n## \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value\n\n- -Debt securit/i.rightes - asset-backed securit/i.rightes: Asset-backed securit/i.rightes are valued based on external prices obtained from consensus pric/i.rightng providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers' quotes, etc. Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is classif/i.righted as Level 2. In instances where third-party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classif/i.righted as Level 3. The fair value of Level 3 securit/i.rightes is estimated using market standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securit/i.rightes with sim/i.rightlar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings\n- -Debt securit/i.rightes in issue: These debt securit/i.rightes relate to structured notes issued by the Group. Where independent market data is available through pric/i.rightng vendors and broker sources these posit/i.rightons are classif/i.righted as Level 2. Where such liqu/i.rightd external prices are not available, valuations of these debt securit/i.rightes are impl/i.righted using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are classif/i.righted as Level 3. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxies from comparable issuers or assets\n- -Derivat/i.rightves: Derivat/i.rightve products are classif/i.righted as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from independent and reliable market data sources. Derivat/i.rightve products are classif/i.righted as Level 3 if there are sign/i.rightficant valuation input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable. Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying ind/i.rightces and interest rate products with quanto payouts. In most cases these unobservable correlation parameters cannot be impl/i.righted from the market, and methods such as histor/i.rightcal analysis and comparison with histor/i.rightcal levels or other benchmark data must be employed\n- -Equity shares - private equity: The major/i.rightty of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciat/i.righton and amortisat/i.righton (EV/EBITDA) ratios - of comparable listed companies. The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies. To ensure comparabil/i.rightty between these unquoted investments and the comparable listed companies, appropriate adjustments are also applied (for example, liqu/i.rightdity and size) in the valuation. In circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable external sources, alternative valuation techniques (for example, discounted cash flow models), which use predominantly unobservable inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied. Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party sources (for example, Bloomberg), and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments (excluding those where observable inputs are available, for example, Over-the-counter (OTC) prices) are classif/i.righted as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgements ranging from determin/i.rightng comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash flow method is applied\n- -Loans and advances: These primar/i.rightly include loans in the global syndicat/i.rightons business which were not syndicated as of the balance sheet date and other financ/i.rightng transactions with/i.rightn Financ/i.rightal Markets and loans and advances includ/i.rightng reverse repurchase agreements that do not have SPPI cash flows or are managed on a fair value basis. These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available, their valuation is based on observable clean sales transactions prices or market observable spreads. If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on comparable loans with sim/i.rightlar credit grade, sector and region, are used. Where observable credit spreads and market standard proxy methods are available, these loans are classif/i.righted as Level 2. Where there are no recent transactions or comparable loans, these loans are classif/i.righted as Level 3\n- -Other debt securit/i.rightes: These debt securit/i.rightes include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes. Where quoted prices are available through pric/i.rightng vendors, brokers or observable trading activ/i.rightties from liqu/i.rightd markets, these are classif/i.righted as Level 2 and valued using such quotes. Where there are sign/i.rightficant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to ill/i.rightquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classif/i.righted as Level 3. The valuations of these debt securit/i.rightes are impl/i.righted using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxied from comparable issuers or assets",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal instruments held at amortised cost\n\nThe following sets out the Group's basis for establish/i.rightng fair values of amortised cost financ/i.rightal instruments and their classif/i.rightcation between Levels 1, 2 and 3. As certain categories of financ/i.rightal instruments are not actively traded, there is a sign/i.rightficant level of management judgement involved in calculating the fair values:\n\n- -Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts\n- -Debt securit/i.rightes in issue, subordinated liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices. For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remain/i.rightng term to maturity\n- -Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash flows using the prevail/i.rightng market rates for debts with a sim/i.rightlar Credit Risk and remain/i.rightng maturity\n- -Investment securit/i.rightes: For investment securit/i.rightes that do not have directly observable market values, the Group util/i.rightses a number of valuation techniques to determine fair value. Where available, securit/i.rightes are valued using input proxies from the same or closely related underlying (for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer) or input proxies from a different underlying (for example, a sim/i.rightlar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating). Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in such cases the posit/i.rightons are valued using non-market observable inputs. This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relates to asset-backed securit/i.rightes. The fair value for such instruments is usually proxies from internal assessments of the underlying cash flows\n- -Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the prevail/i.rightng money market rates for debts with a sim/i.rightlar Credit Risk and remain/i.rightng maturity. The Group's loans and advances to customers' portfolio is well divers/i.rightfied by geography and industry. Approximately a quarter of the portfolio re-prices with/i.rightn one month, and approximately half re-prices with/i.rightn 12 months. Loans and advances are presented net of provis/i.rightons for impa/i.rightrment. The fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value. The estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received, includ/i.rightng assumptions relating to prepayment rates and Credit Risk. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value. The Group has a wide range of ind/i.rightvidual instruments with/i.rightn its loans and advances portfolio and as a result provid/i.rightng quantif/i.rightcation of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impract/i.rightcal\n- -Other assets: Other assets comprise primar/i.rightly of cash collateral and trades pending settlement. The carrying amount of these financ/i.rightal instruments is considered to be a reasonable approximat/i.righton of fair value as they are either short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nWhen establish/i.rightng the exit price of a financ/i.rightal instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market partic/i.rightpants would make when pric/i.rightng that instrument. The main valuation adjustments (described further below) in determin/i.rightng fair value for financ/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are as follows:\n\n|                                | 01.01.2020  $mill/i.righton   | Movement  during the year  $mill/i.righton   | 31.12.20  $mill/i.righton   | 01.01.2019  $mill/i.righton   | Movement  during the year  $mill/i.righton   | 31.12.19  $mill/i.righton   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Bid-offer valuation adjustment | 79                            | 24                                           | 103                         | 67                            | 12                                           | 79                          |\n| Credit valuation adjustment    | 136                           | 53                                           | 189                         | 196                           | (60)                                         | 136                         |\n| Debit valuation adjustment     | (43)                          | (12)                                         | (55)                        | (143)                         | 100                                          | (43)                        |\n| Model valuation adjustment     | 7                             | (2)                                          | 5                           | 6                             | 1                                            | 7                           |\n| Funding valuation adjustment   | 26                            | (21)                                         | 5                           | 60                            | (34)                                         | 26                          |\n| Other fair value adjustments   | 45                            | (13)                                         | 32                          | 59                            | (14)                                         | 45                          |\n| Total                          | 250                           | 29                                           | 279                         | 245                           | 5                                            | 250                         |\n| Income deferrals               |                               |                                              |                             |                               |                                              |                             |\n| Day 1 and other deferrals      | 103                           | 35                                           | 138                         | 100                           | 3                                            | 103                         |\n| Total                          | 103                           | 35                                           | 138                         | 100                           | 3                                            | 103                         |\n\nNote: Bracket represents an asset and credit to the income statement\n\n- \u00b7 Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Generally, market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, and a bid-offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralis/i.rightng the business' posit/i.rightons through dealing away in the market, thereby bring/i.rightng long posit/i.rightons to bid and short posit/i.rightons to offer. The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivat/i.rightve portfolio involves netting between long and short posit/i.rightons and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long posit/i.rightons are marked to bid and short posit/i.rightons marked to offer in the systems",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n- \u00b7 Credit valuation adjustment (CVA): The Group accounts for CVA against the fair value of derivat/i.rightve products. CVA is an adjustment to the fair value of the transactions to reflect the possib/i.rightlity that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding transactions. It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market partic/i.rightpant would include when deriv/i.rightng a purchase price to acquire our exposures. CVA is calculated for each subsid/i.rightary, and with/i.rightn each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes account of any collateral we may hold. The Group calculates the CVA by using estimates of future posit/i.rightve exposure, market-impl/i.righted probabil/i.rightty of default (PD) and recovery rates. Where market-impl/i.righted data is not readily available, we use market-based proxies to estimate the PD. Wrong-way risk occurs when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty, and the Group has implemented a model to capture this impact for key wrong-way exposures. The Group also captures the uncertaint/i.rightes associated with wrong-way risk in the Group's Prudential Valuation Adjustments framework\n- \u00b7 Debit valuation adjustment (DVA): The Group calculates DVA adjustments on its derivat/i.rightve liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes to reflect changes in its own credit standing. The Group's DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. For derivat/i.rightve liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, a DVA adjustment is determined by applying the Group's probabil/i.rightty of default to the Group's negative expected exposure against the counterparty. The Group's probabil/i.rightty of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on bond and CDS spreads associated with the Group's issuances and market standard recovery levels. The expected exposure is modelled based on the simulat/i.righton of the underlying risk factors over the expected life of the deal. This simulat/i.righton methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements\n- \u00b7 Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pric/i.rightng defic/i.rightencies or lim/i.righttations that require a valuation adjustment. These pric/i.rightng defic/i.rightencies or lim/i.righttations arise due to the choice, implementat/i.righton and calibrat/i.righton of the pric/i.rightng model\n- \u00b7 Funding valuation adjustment (FVA): The Group makes FVA adjustments against derivat/i.rightve products. FVA reflects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that a market partic/i.rightpant would make to incorporate funding costs or benefits that could arise in relation to the exposure. FVA is calculated by determin/i.rightng the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that reflect the market cost of funding. The FVA for uncollateralised (includ/i.rightng partially collateralised) derivat/i.rightves incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or benefit associated with funding these transactions\n- \u00b7 Other fair value adjustments: The Group calculates the fair value on the interest rate callable products by calibrat/i.rightng to a set of market prices with differ/i.rightng maturity, expiry and strike of the trades\n- \u00b7 Day one and other deferrals: In certain circumstances the in/i.righttial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which differs to the transaction price at the time of in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton. However, gains can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based primar/i.rightly on observable market data. In those cases where the in/i.righttially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immed/i.rightately in the income statement. The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated. Other deferrals primar/i.rightly represent adjustments taken to reflect the specif/i.rightc terms and condit/i.rightons of certain derivat/i.rightve contracts which affect the terminat/i.righton value at the measurement date\n\nIn addit/i.righton, the Group calculates own credit adjustment (OCA) on its issued debt designated at fair value, includ/i.rightng structured notes, in order to reflect changes in its own credit standing. Own issued note liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are discounted util/i.rightsing spreads as at the measurement date. These spreads consist of a market level of funding component and an id/i.rightosyncratic own credit component. Under IFRS 9 the change in the own credit component (OCA) is reported under other comprehensive income. The Group's OCA reserve will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. The Group's OCA reserve will reverse over time as its liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes mature. The OCA at 31 December 2020 is a loss of $43 mill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $17 mill/i.righton gain).\n\n## Fair value hierarchy - financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value\n\nAssets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classif/i.righted into three levels according to the observabil/i.rightty of the sign/i.rightficant inputs used to determine the fair values. Changes in the observabil/i.rightty of sign/i.rightficant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes with/i.rightn the fair value hierarchy. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a sign/i.rightficant change in either its princ/i.rightpal market or the level of observabil/i.rightty of the inputs to the valuation techniques as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for ident/i.rightcal assets or liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for sim/i.rightlar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for ident/i.rightcal or sim/i.rightlar instruments in inact/i.rightve markets and financ/i.rightal instruments valued using models where all sign/i.rightficant inputs are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where inputs which could have a sign/i.rightficant effect on the instrument's valuation are not based on observable market data",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Level 3 Summary and sign/i.rightficant unobservable inputs continued\n\nThe following section describes the sign/i.rightficant unobservable inputs ident/i.rightfied in the valuation technique table:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable price/yield is a valuation methodology in which the price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no direct observable prices. Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash flows in a discounted cash flow model. Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an impl/i.righted yield (or spread over a liqu/i.rightd benchmark) from the price of a comparable instrument, then adjust/i.rightng that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the instrument. The adjustment should account for relevant differences in the financ/i.rightal instruments such as maturity and/or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument (for example, deriv/i.rightng a fair value for a jun/i.rightor unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond). An increase in price, in isolat/i.righton, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the asset. An increase in yield, in isolat/i.righton, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset\n- \u00b7 Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable. An equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates\n- \u00b7 Credit spread represents the addit/i.rightonal yield that a market partic/i.rightpant would demand for taking exposure to the Credit Risk of an instrument\n- \u00b7 Discount rate refers to the rate of return used to convert expected cash flows into present value\n- \u00b7 Equity-FX correlation is the correlation between equity instrument and foreign exchange instrument\n- \u00b7 EV/EBITDA ratio multiples is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciat/i.righton and Amortisat/i.righton (EBITDA). EV is the aggregate market capital/i.rightsation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents. An increase in EV/EBITDA multiples in isolat/i.righton, will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange curves is the term structure for forward rates and swap rates between currency pairs over a specif/i.righted period\n- \u00b7 Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point in time\n- \u00b7 Liqu/i.rightdity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments primar/i.rightly applied to the valuation of unlisted firms' investments to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase in liqu/i.rightdity discount will result in unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Earnings (P/E) multiples is the ratio of the Market Capital/i.rightsation to the net income after tax. The multiples are determined from multiples of listed comparables, which are observable. An increase in P/E multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Book (P/B) multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity. An increase in P/B multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Sales (P/S) multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to sales. An increase in P/S multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Recovery rates are the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liqu/i.rightdation of a particular loan. As the probabil/i.rightty of default increases for a given instrument, the valuation of that instrument will increas/i.rightngly reflect its expected recovery level assuming default. An increase in the recovery rate, in isolat/i.righton, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan\n- \u00b7 Volatil/i.rightty represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time. Generally, the higher the volatil/i.rightty, the more expensive the option will be",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes in respect of the fair values of Level 3 assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nSensit/i.rightvity analysis is performed on products with sign/i.rightficant unobservable inputs. The Group applies a 10 per cent increase or decrease on the values of these unobservable inputs, to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations. The percentage shift is determined by statist/i.rightcal analysis performed on a set of reference prices based on the composit/i.righton of the Group's Level 3 inventory as the measurement date. Favourable and unfavourable changes (which show the balance adjusted for input change) are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters. The Level 3 sensit/i.rightvity analysis assumes a one-way market move and does not consider offsets for hedges.\n\n|                                                                               | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Fair value through other comprehensive income   | Fair value through other comprehensive income   | Fair value through other comprehensive income   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                               | Net exposure  $mill/i.righton               | Favourable  changes  $mill/i.righton        | Unfavourable  changes  $mill/i.righton      | Net exposure  $mill/i.righton                   | Favourable  changes  $mill/i.righton            | Unfavourable  changes  $mill/i.righton          |\n| Financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value                               |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |\n| Loans and advances                                                            | 918                                         | 947                                         | 867                                         | -

Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nDerivat/i.rightves are financ/i.rightal instruments that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financ/i.rightal instrument prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and ind/i.rightces. Derivat/i.rightves are categorised as trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.\n\nDerivat/i.rightves are in/i.righttially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with revaluation gains recognised in profit or loss (except where cash flow or net investment hedging has been achieved, in which case the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised with/i.rightn other comprehensive income).\n\nFair values may be obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, includ/i.rightng discounted cash flow models and option pric/i.rightng models, as appropriate. Where the in/i.righttially recognised fair value of a derivat/i.rightve contract is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, it follows the same in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton accounting policy as for other financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. All derivat/i.rightves are carried as assets when fair value is posit/i.rightve and as liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes when fair value is negative.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nUnder certain condit/i.rightons, the Group may designate a recognised asset or liab/i.rightlity, a firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment of a foreign operation into a formal hedge accounting relationsh/i.rightp with a derivat/i.rightve that has been entered to manage interest rate and/or foreign exchange risks present in the hedged item. The Group continues to apply the 'Phase 1' hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 Financ/i.rightal Instruments: Recognit/i.righton and Measurement and has early adopted the 'Phase 2' amendments to IFRS in respect of interest rate benchmark reform. There are three categories of hedge relationsh/i.rightps:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedge: to manage the fair value of interest rate and/or foreign currency risks of recognised assets or liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes or firm commitments\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedge: to manage interest rate or foreign exchange risk of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liab/i.rightlity, or a forecasted transaction\n- \u00b7 Net investment hedge: to manage the structural foreign exchange risk of an investment in a foreign operation\n\nThe Group formally documents at the incept/i.righton of the transaction the relationsh/i.rightp between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management object/i.rightve and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This is described in more detail in the categories of hedges below.\n\nThe Group assesses, both at hedge incept/i.righton and on a quarterly basis, whether the derivat/i.rightves designated in hedge relationsh/i.rightps are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Hedges are considered to be highly effective if all the following criter/i.righta are met:\n\n- \u00b7 At incept/i.righton of the hedge and throughout its life, the hedge is prospectively expected to be highly effective in achiev/i.rightng offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk\n- \u00b7 Actual results of the hedge are with/i.rightn a range of 80-125%. This is tested using regression analysis\n- \u00b7 The regression co-effic/i.rightent (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression, is at least 80%\n- \u00b7 In the case of the hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction must have a high probabil/i.rightty of occurring and must present an exposure to variat/i.rightons in cash flows that are expected to affect reported profit or loss. The Group assumes that any interest rate benchmarks on which hedged item cash flows are based are not altered by IBOR reform\n\nThe Group discont/i.rightnues hedge accounting in any of the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 The hedging instrument is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge\n- \u00b7 The hedging instrument has expired, is sold, terminated or exercised\n- \u00b7 The hedged item matures, is sold or repaid\n- \u00b7 The forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable\n- \u00b7 The Group elects to discont/i.rightnue hedge accounting voluntarily\n\nFor interest rate benchmarks deemed in scope of IBOR reform, if the actual result of a hedge is outside the 80-125% range, but the hedge passes the prospective assessment, then the Group will not de-designate the hedge relationsh/i.rightp.\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39, the Group may change hedge designat/i.rightons and corresponding documentation without the hedge being discont/i.rightnued where there is a change in interest rate benchmark of the hedged item, hedging instrument or designated hedged risk. Permitted changes include the right to:\n\n- \u00b7 Redefine the descript/i.righton of the hedged item and/or hedging instrument\n- \u00b7 Redefine the hedged risk to reference an alternative risk-free rate\n- \u00b7 Change the method for assessing hedge effectiveness due to modif/i.rightcations required by IBOR reform\n- \u00b7 Elect, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to reset the cumulative fair value changes in the assessment of retrospective hedge effectiveness to zero\n\nA hedge designat/i.righton may be modif/i.righted more than once, each time a relationsh/i.rightp is affected as a direct result of IBOR reform.",

Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivat/i.rightves that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in net trading income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liab/i.rightlity that are attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criter/i.righta for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the remain/i.rightng term to maturity of the hedged item. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immed/i.rightately in the income statement. For financ/i.rightal assets classif/i.righted as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment attributable to the hedged risk is included in net trading income to match the hedging derivat/i.rightve.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivat/i.rightves that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are in/i.righttially recognised in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the cash flow hedge reserve with/i.rightn equity. These amounts are subsequently recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Both the derivat/i.rightve fair value movement and any recycled amount are recorded in the 'Cashflow hedges' line item in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge effectiveness using the hypothetical derivat/i.rightve method, which creates a derivat/i.rightve instrument to serve as a proxy for the hedged transaction. The terms of the hypothetical derivat/i.rightve match the crit/i.rightcal terms of the hedged item and it has a fair value of zero at incept/i.righton. The hypothetical derivat/i.rightve and the actual derivat/i.rightve are regressed to establish the statist/i.rightcal sign/i.rightficance of the hedge relationsh/i.rightp. Any ineffect/i.rightve portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the net trading income immed/i.rightately.\n\nIf a cash flow hedge is discont/i.rightnued, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is released to the income statement as and when the hedged item affects the income statement.\n\nFor interest rate benchmarks deemed in scope of IBOR reform, the Group will retain the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve for designated cash flow hedges even though there is uncertainty aris/i.rightng from these reforms with respect to the tim/i.rightng and amount of the cash flows of the hedged items. Should the Group consider the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur due to reasons other than IBOR reform, the cumulative gain or loss will be immed/i.rightately reclassif/i.righted to profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments are accounted for in a sim/i.rightlar manner to cash flow hedges, with gains and losses aris/i.rightng on the effective portion of the hedges recorded in the line 'Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations' in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the translation reserve with/i.rightn equity. These amounts remain in equity until the net investment is disposed of. The ineffect/i.rightve portion of the hedges is recognised in the net trading income immed/i.rightately.\n\nThe tables below analyse the notional princ/i.rightpal amounts and the posit/i.rightve and negative fair values of derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments. Notional princ/i.rightpal amounts are the amounts of princ/i.rightpal underlying the contract at the reporting date.\n\n## Derivat/i.rightves\n\n|                                               | 2020                                                 | 2020                    | 2020                                       | 2019                                                 | 2019                    | 2019                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                               | Notional  princ/i.rightpal  amounts  $mill/i.righton | Assets  $mill/i.righton | Liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes  $mill/i.righton | Notional  princ/i.rightpal  amounts  $mill/i.righton | Assets  $mill/i.righton | Liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes  $mill/i.righton |\n| Foreign exchange derivat/i.rightve contracts: |                                                      |                         |                                            |                                                      |                         |                                            |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts            | 3,018,866                                            | 37, 505                 | 39,181                                     | 2,290,781                                            | 16,281                  | 16,396                                     |\n| Currency swaps and options                    | 1,423,520                                            | 1 7,1 42                | 1 7,9 0 4                                  | 806,226                                              | 9,725                   | 10,530                                     |\n| Exchange traded futures and options           | -

The Group also holds various fixed rate debt securit/i.rightes such as government and corporate bonds, includ/i.rightng some denominated in foreign currency (see Note 13). These assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held are exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest and foreign currency rates.\n\nThe Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange fixed rates for floating rates on funding to match floating rates received on assets, or exchange fixed rates on assets to match floating rates paid on funding. The Group further uses cross currency swaps to match the currency of the issued debt or held asset with that of the entity's functional currency.\n\nHedge ineffect/i.rightveness from fair value hedges is driven by cross currency basis risk. The amortisat/i.righton of fair value hedge adjustments for hedged items no longer designated is recognised in net trading income. In future periods hedge relationsh/i.rightps linked to an interest rate benchmark deemed in scope of benchmark reform may experience ineffect/i.rightveness due to market partic/i.rightpants' expectations for when the change from the exist/i.rightng IBOR benchmark to an alternative risk-free rate will occur, since the transit/i.righton may occur at different times for the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Group held the following interest rate and cross currency swaps as hedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest and currency risk.",

The amounts and tim/i.rightng of future cash flows, representing both princ/i.rightpal and interest flows, are projected on the basis of contractual terms and other relevant factors, includ/i.rightng estimates of prepayments and defaults.\n\nThe hedging strategy of the Group involves using interest rate swaps to manage the variab/i.rightlity in future cash flows on assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes that have floating rates of interest by exchanging the floating rates for fixed rates. It also uses foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to manage the variab/i.rightlity in future exchange rates on its assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and costs in foreign currencies. This is done on both a micro basis whereby a single interest rate or cross currency swap is designated in a separate relationsh/i.rightp with a single hedged item (such as a floating rate loan to a customer), and on a portfolio basis whereby each hedging instrument is designated against a group of hedged items that share the same risk (such as a group of customer accounts).\n\nThe hedged risk is determined as the variab/i.rightlity of future cash flows aris/i.rightng from changes in the designated benchmark interest rate, e.g. one-month or three-month LIBOR.\n\n## Hedging instruments and ineffect/i.rightveness\n\n|                                   | 2020                      | 2020                   | 2020                              | 2020                                            | 2020                    | 2020                                                     | 2020                                           |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                                   |                           | Carrying amount        | Carrying amount                   | Change in fair  value used to  calculate  hedge | Gain/(loss)  recognised | Ineffectiveness  gain/(loss)  recognised in  net trading | Amount  reclassif/i.righted  from  reserves to |\n|                                   | Notional  $mill/i.righton | Asset  $mill/i.righton | Liab/i.rightlity  $mill/i.righton | ineffect/i.rightveness  $mill/i.righton         | in OCI  $mill/i.righton | income  $mill/i.righton                                  | income  $mill/i.righton                        |\n| Interest rate risk                |                           |                        |                                   |                                                 |                         |                                                          |                                                |\n| Interest rate swaps               | 9,347                     | 83                     | 129                               | (45)                                            | (45)                    | -

This risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsid/i.rightaries and the Group's presentation currency, which causes the value of the investment to vary.\n\nThe Group's policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so would be expected to have a sign/i.rightficant impact on the regulatory ratios of the Group and its banking subsid/i.rightaries. The Group uses foreign exchange forwards to manage the effect of exchange rates on its net investments in foreign subsid/i.rightaries.",

Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe Group applies the Phase 1 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7' which allow the Group to assume that the interest rate benchmark on which cash flows for the hedged item and/or hedging instrument are based is are altered as a result of IBOR reform for the following activ/i.rightties:\n\n- \u00b7 Prospective hedge assessment\n- \u00b7 Determin/i.rightng whether a cash flow or forecast transaction for a cash flow hedge is highly probable. However, the Group otherwise assesses whether the cash flows are considered highly probable\n- \u00b7 Determin/i.rightng when cumulative balances in the cash flow hedge reserve from de-designated hedges should be recycled to the income statement\n\nThe Group will not de-designate a hedge relationsh/i.rightp of a benchmark in scope of IBOR reform if the retrospective hedge result is outside the required 80-125% range but, the hedge passes the prospective assessment. Any hedge ineffect/i.rightveness continues to be recorded in net trading income.\n\nFor hedges of non-contractually specif/i.righted benchmark portions of an interest rate (such as fair value hedges of interest rate risk on fixed rate debt instruments) the Group only assesses whether the designated benchmark is separately ident/i.rightfiable at hedge incept/i.righton. The choice of designated benchmark is not revis/i.rightted for exist/i.rightng hedge relationsh/i.rightps.\n\nIn applying these amendments, the Group has made the following key assumptions for the period end, to be reviewed on an ongoing basis:\n\n- \u00b7 The interest rate benchmarks applicable to the Group that are in scope of the IFRS amendments are all LIBORs, EONIA, Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SGD SOR) and Thai Baht Interest Rate Fix/i.rightng (THB FIX)\n- \u00b7 EURIBOR is not in scope of the IFRS amendments because its revised methodology incorporates market transaction data, hence the benchmark is expected to continue to exist in future reporting periods\n- \u00b7 The Group believes it is too early to reliably estimate when interest rate benchmark uncertainty will be resolved for all benchmarks assumed to be in scope of the amendments. It therefore assumes that the uncertainty aris/i.rightng from interest rate benchmark reform will be present until 31 December 2021, at which time the amendments to IFRS no longer apply\n\nThe Group has established an IBOR Transit/i.righton Programme that is overseen by the Group's Chief Operating Officer, and updates a number of committees includ/i.rightng the Board Risk Committee and Group Risk Committee regularly updated. The programme comprises a series of business and function workstreams, with oversight and coordinat/i.righton of the specif/i.rightc areas and risks provided by a central project team. The key object/i.rightves of these workstreams include ident/i.rightfying all contracts in scope of benchmark reform, upgrading internal systems to support business in the alternative RFR product suite, ident/i.rightfying and communicat/i.rightng to customers with whom repric/i.rightng and/or re-papering IBOR-referenced contracts is required and executing the necessary change in contracts. Workstreams actively partic/i.rightpate in industry-wide working groups to ensure they are kept informed of the latest developments and are consistent with the approaches of other market partic/i.rightpants.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the following populations of derivat/i.rightve instruments designated in fair value or cash flow hedge accounting relationsh/i.rightps were linked to IBOR reference rates:\n\n|                                                                                              | Fair value hedges                                                 | Fair value hedges                                                 | Cash flow hedges                                                  | Cash flow hedges                                                  |                        |                                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                              | Notional  designated   up to   31 December  2021  $mill/i.righton | Notional  designated  beyond   31 December  2021  $mill/i.righton | Notional  designated   up to   31 December  2021  $mill/i.righton | Notional  designated  beyond   31 December  2021  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Weighted  average  exposure  Years |\n| Interest rate swaps                                                                          |                                                                   |                                                                   |                                                                   |                                                                   |                        |                                    |\n| USD LIBOR                                                                                    | 9,454                                                             | 36,024                                                            | 345                                                               | 2,733                                                             | 48,556                 | 3.2                                |\n| GBP LIBOR                                                                                    | 268                                                               | 1,720                                                             | 89                                                                | -

Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements includ/i.rightng other sim/i.rightlar lending and borrowing\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group purchases securit/i.rightes (a reverse repurchase agreement - 'reverse repo') typically with financ/i.rightal inst/i.righttutions subject to a commitment to resell or return the securit/i.rightes at a predetermined price. These securit/i.rightes are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership, however they are recorded off-balance sheet as collateral received. Considerat/i.righton paid (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is managed on a fair value basis or designated at fair value through profit or loss. In the major/i.rightty of cases through the contractual terms of a reverse repo arrangement, the Group as the transferee of the security collateral has the right to sell or repledge the asset concerned.\n\nThe Group also sells securit/i.rightes (a repurchase agreement - 'repo') subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem the securit/i.rightes at a predetermined price. The securit/i.rightes are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and these securit/i.rightes are disclosed as pledged collateral. Considerat/i.righton received (or cash collateral received) is accounted for as a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity at amortised cost, unless it is either mandatorily classif/i.righted as fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets are pledged as collateral as part of sales and repurchases, securit/i.rightes borrowing and securit/i.rightsation transactions under terms that are usual and customary for such activ/i.rightties. The Group is obliged to return equivalent securit/i.rightes.\n\nRepo and reverse repo transactions typically entitle the Group and its counterparties to have recourse to assets sim/i.rightlar to those provided as collateral in the event of a default. Securit/i.rightes sold subject to repos, either by way of a Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), or through a securit/i.rightes sale and Total Return Swap (TRS) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially the associated risks and rewards of the securit/i.rightes (the TRS is not recognised). The counterparty liab/i.rightlity is included in deposits by banks or customer accounts, as appropriate. Assets sold under repurchase agreements are considered encumbered as the Group cannot pledge these to obtain funding.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements and other sim/i.rightlar secured lending\n\n|                                   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Banks                             | 19,452                  | 19,610                  |\n| Customers                         | 48,119                  | 40,804                  |\n|                                   | 67, 571                 | 60,414                  |\n| Of which:                         |                         |                         |\n| Fair value through profit or loss | 63,405                  | 57,604                  |\n| Banks                             | 18,205                  | 18,269                  |\n| Customers                         | 45,200                  | 39,335                  |\n| Held at amortised cost            | 4,166                   | 2,810                   |\n| Banks                             | 1,247                   | 1,341                   |\n| Customers                         | 2,919                   | 1,469                   |\n\nUnder reverse repurchase and securit/i.rightes borrowing arrangements, the Group obtains securit/i.rightes on terms which permit it to repledge or resell the securit/i.rightes to others.

        "page_content": "## 17. Goodwill and intang/i.rightble assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquis/i.righttion over the fair value of the Group's share of the ident/i.rightfiable net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the acquired subsid/i.rightary, associate or jo/i.rightnt venture at the date of acquis/i.righttion. Goodwill on acquis/i.righttions of subsid/i.rightaries is included in intang/i.rightble assets. Goodwill on acquis/i.righttions of associates is included in Investments in associates. Goodwill included in Intangible assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impa/i.rightrment and carried at cost less any accumulated impa/i.rightrment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Detailed calculations are performed based on discount/i.rightng expected cash flows of the relevant cash-generating units (CGUs) and discount/i.rightng these at an appropriate discount rate, the determinat/i.righton of which requires the exercise of judgement. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impa/i.rightrment testing. CGUs represent the lowest level with/i.rightn the Group which generate separate cash inflows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. These are equal to or smaller than the Group's reportable segments (as set out in Note 2) as the Group views its reportable segments on a global basis. The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table (page 368).\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is based on the applicat/i.righton of judgements includ/i.rightng the basis of goodwill impa/i.rightrment calculation assumptions. Judgement is also applied in determinat/i.righton of cash-generating units.\n\nEstimates include forecasts used for determin/i.rightng cash flows for CGUs, the appropriate long term growth rates to use and discount rates which factor in country risk-free rates and applicable risk premiums. These estimates are period/i.rightcally assessed for appropriateness. The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill is impa/i.rightred. The estimat/i.righton of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires sign/i.rightficant judgement and is subject to potential change over time.\n\n## Acquired intang/i.rightbles\n\nAt the date of acquis/i.righttion of a subsid/i.rightary or associate, intang/i.rightble assets which are deemed separable and that arise from contractual or other legal rights are capital/i.rightsed and included with/i.rightn the net ident/i.rightfiable assets acquired. These intang/i.rightble assets are in/i.righttially measured at fair value, which reflects market expectations of the probabil/i.rightty that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity and are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives (4 to 16 years). At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down immed/i.rightately.\n\n## Computer software\n\nAcquired computer software licences are capital/i.rightsed on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specif/i.rightc software.\n\nInternally generated software represents substantially all of the total software capital/i.rightsed. Direct costs of the development of separately ident/i.rightfiable internally generated software are capital/i.rightsed where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow from its use (internally generated software). These costs include salaries and wages, materials, service providers and contractors, and directly attributable overheads. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immed/i.rightately when incurred. Internally generated software is amortised over a three to five-year time period. On an annual basis software assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, includ/i.rightng assessing for ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment. Indicators of impa/i.rightrment include loss of business relevance, obsolescence of asset, exit of the business to which the software relates, technological changes, change in use of the asset, reduction in useful life, plans to reduce usage or scope.\n\nFor capital/i.rightsed software, judgement is required to determine which costs relate to research (and therefore expensed) and which costs relate to development (capital/i.rightsed). Further judgement is required to determine the technical feasib/i.rightlity of completing the software such that it will be available for use. Estimates are used to determine how the software will generate probable future economic benefits, these estimates include: cost savings, income increases, balance sheet improvements, improved functional/i.rightty or improved asset safeguarding.",

For the purposes of impa/i.rightrment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquis/i.righttion to a CGU. Goodwill is considered to be impa/i.rightred if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Indicators of impa/i.rightrment include changes in the economic performance and outlook of the region includ/i.rightng geopolit/i.rightcal changes, changes in market value of regional investments, large credit defaults and strategic decis/i.rightons to exit certain regions. The recoverable amounts for all the CGUs were measured based on value-in-use (ViU). The calculation of ViU for each CGU is calculated using five-year cash flow project/i.rightons and an estimated terminal value based on a perpetuity value after year five. The cash flow project/i.rightons are based on forecasts approved by management up to 2025. The perpetuity terminal value amount is calculated using year five cash flows using long-term GDP growth rates. All cash flows are discounted using discount rates which reflect market rates appropriate to the CGU.\n\nThe goodwill allocated to each CGU and key assumptions used in determin/i.rightng the recoverable amounts are set out below and are solely estimates for the purposes of assessing impa/i.rightrment of acquired goodwill.",

This was primar/i.rightly due to lower economic growth forecasts, higher discount rates and forward-looking cash flows reflecting lower interest rate environments. As a result, the carrying amount of each CGU, which included goodwill, was greater than the recoverable amount.\n\nIn view of the increased economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has performed sensit/i.rightvity analysis on the key assumptions for each CGU's recoverable amount. The following CGUs are considered sensit/i.rightve to the key variables and any ind/i.rightvidual movements on the estimates (cashflow, discount rate and GDP growth rate) up to the levels disclosed below would elim/i.rightnate the current headroom.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table above represents reasonably possible scenarios that could occur if either; economic factors (which drive GDP rates and discount rates); country-specif/i.rightc cash flows; or a combinat/i.righton of both are different from the assumptions used in the goodwill impa/i.rightrment assessment at 31 December 2020.\n\nFor there to be no headroom, the discount rate will need to increase by 1.37 per cent and 1.19 per cent, for Taiwan and Global Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking (CIB) respectively. Sim/i.rightlarly, the GDP rates will need to decrease by 1.87 per cent, 1.63 per cent and cash flows would need to decrease by 13.71 per cent, 10.91 per cent for Taiwan and Global CIB respectively .",

Goodwill and intang/i.rightble assets continued\n\n## Acquired intang/i.rightbles\n\nThese primar/i.rightly comprise those items recognised as part of the acquis/i.righttions of Union Bank (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Lim/i.rightted), Hsinchu (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Taiwan) Lim/i.rightted), Pembroke, American Express Bank and ABSA's custody business in Africa. Maintenance intang/i.rightble assets represent the value in the difference between the contractual right under acquired leases to receive aircraft in a specif/i.righted maintenance condit/i.righton at the end of the lease and the actual physical condit/i.righton of the aircraft at the date of acquis/i.righttion.\n\nThe acquired intang/i.rightbles are amortised over periods from four years to a maximum of 16 years. The constituents are as follows:\n\n|                                       | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Acquired intang/i.rightbles comprise: |                         |                         |\n| Aircraft maintenance                  | 6                       | 10                      |\n| Core deposits                         | -                       | 1                       |\n| Customer relationsh/i.rightps         | 7                       | 12                      |\n| Licences                              | 9                       | 7                       |\n| Net book value                        | 22                      | 30                      |\n\n## 18. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nAll property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciat/i.righton and impa/i.rightrment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquis/i.righttion of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nAt each balance sheet date the assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, includ/i.rightng assessing for ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are included in the income statement.\n\nRepairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financ/i.rightal period in which they are incurred.\n\nLand and build/i.rightngs comprise mainly branches and offices. Freehold land is not depreciated although it is subject to impa/i.rightrment testing.\n\nDepreciat/i.righton on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Build/i.rightngs\n- \u00b7 up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Leasehold improvements life of lease\n- \u00b7  up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Equipment and motor vehicles\n- \u00b7  three to 15 years\n- \u00b7 Aircraft\n- \u00b7 up to 18 years\n- \u00b7 Ships\n- \u00b7 up to 15 years\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee of a right-of-use asset, the leased assets are capital/i.rightsed and included in Property, plant and equipment with a corresponding liab/i.rightlity to the lessor recognised in Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, in accordance with the Group's leased assets accounting policy in Note 19.\n\nAll other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financ/i.rightal period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's aircraft leasing portfolio is based on the applicat/i.righton of judgement and estimates to determine the most appropriate recoverable amount for each aircraft when assessing for impa/i.rightrment. Estimates involve the appropriate cash flows, discount rates and residual values used in determin/i.rightng a value-in-use for aircraft, and judgement is required in determin/i.rightng the appropriate observable third-party valuations to use for assessing current market value.",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Operating lease assets\n\nThe operating lease assets subsection of property, plant and equipment is the Group's aircraft leasing business, consist/i.rightng of 114 commercial aircraft, of which 107 are narrow-body and 7 wide-body, leased to clients under operating leases. The leases are classif/i.righted as operating leases as they do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards inc/i.rightdental to the ownership of the assets, and rental income from operating lease assets is disclosed in Note 6. At 31 December 2020, these assets had a net book value of $3,897 mill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $3,394 mill/i.righton).\n\nUnder these leases the lessee is responsible for the maintenance and servic/i.rightng of the aircraft during the lease term while the Group receives rental income and assumes the risks of the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease. Init/i.rightal lease terms range in length up to 12 years, while the average remain/i.rightng lease term at 31 December 2020 is approximately six years. By varying the lease terms the effects of changes in cyclical market condit/i.rightons at the time aircraft become elig/i.rightble for re-lease are mit/i.rightgated. The Group will look at entering into a lease extension with exist/i.rightng lessees well in advance of lease expiry in order to min/i.rightmise the risk of aircraft downtime and aircraft transit/i.righton costs. Aircraft may also be sold from time to time to manage the composit/i.righton and average age of the fleet.\n\nA series of stress sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes conducted on the narrow-body portfolio highl/i.rightght the two biggest risks remain either an increase in the discount rate in conjunct/i.righton with further market value decreases, as the major/i.rightty of the leased portfolio is now valued on a VIU basis, or a substantial number of airl/i.rightne clients defaulting. A sensit/i.rightvity test was performed on the narrow-body portfolio assuming a discount rate increase of 50 basis points and a future market value decrease of 10 per cent, which resulted in a possible increase in impa/i.rightrment of $46 mill/i.righton.\n\nA further sensit/i.rightvity test considered that the lessees with lower credit ratings defaulted on their current leases. This scenario would result in a possible increase in impa/i.rightrment of $38 mill/i.righton.\n\nDuring 2020 the Group offered payment concessions to customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing them to defer lease payments for between three and nine months. As of 31 December 2020 the outstanding amount of deferred lease payments was $19 mill/i.righton. For customers who have not defaulted on their obligat/i.rightons, deferrals do not affect income recognit/i.righton provided the total lease rentals and lease expiry date are unchanged. For customers who have defaulted, any income not covered by collateral is provided against. The provis/i.righton is reversed on receipt of the deferred payment.\n\nThe table below gives a maturity analysis of undiscounted lease payments receivable in future periods:\n\n|                        | 2020  Min/i.rightmum lease  receivables  under operating  leases   falling due:  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  Min/i.rightmum lease  receivables   under operating  leases   falling due:  $mill/i.righton   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| With/i.rightn one year | 478                                                                                                | 473                                                                                                 |\n| One to two years       | 436                                                                                                | 451                                                                                                 |\n| Two to three years     | 374                                                                                                | 403                                                                                                 |\n| Three to four years    | 328                                                                                                | 337                                                                                                 |\n| Four to five years     | 251                                                                                                | 82                                                                                                  |\n| After five years       | 697                                                                                                | 789                                                                                                 |\n|                        | 2,564                                                                                              | 2,535                                                                                               |",

Leased assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is a lease in scope of this policy by determin/i.rightng whether the contract gives it the right to use a specif/i.righted underlying physical asset for a lease term greater than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee and the lease is deemed in scope, it recognises a liab/i.rightlity equal to the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate applicable in the economic environment of the lease. The liab/i.rightlity is recognised in 'Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes'. A corresponding right-of-use asset equal to the liab/i.rightlity, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, is recognised in 'Property, plant and equipment'. The lease term includes any extension options contained in the contract that the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise.\n\nThe Group subsequently depreciates the right-of-use asset using the straight-line method over the lease term and measures the lease liab/i.rightlity using the effective interest method. Depreciat/i.righton on the asset is recognised in 'Depreciat/i.righton and amortisat/i.righton', and interest on the lease liab/i.rightlity is recognised in 'Interest expense'.\n\nThe judgements in determin/i.rightng lease balances are the determinat/i.righton of whether the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise extension options present in lease contracts. On in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, the Group considers a range of characterist/i.rightcs such as premises function, regional trends and the term remain/i.rightng on the lease to determine whether it is reasonably certain that a contractual right to extend a lease will be exercised. Where a change in assumption is confirmed by the local property management team, a remeasurement is performed in the Group-managed vendor system.\n\nThe estimates were the determinat/i.righton of incremental borrowing rates in the respective economic environments. The Group uses third-party broker quotes to estimate its USD cost of senior unsecured borrowing, then uses cross-currency swap pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton to determine the equivalent cost of borrowing in other currencies. If it is not possible to estimate an incremental borrowing rate through this process, other proxies such as local government bond yields are used.\n\nThe Group primar/i.rightly enters lease contracts that grant it the right to use premises such as office build/i.rightngs and retail branches.\n\nExist/i.rightng lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes may change in future periods due to changes in assumptions or decis/i.rightons to exercise lease renewal or terminat/i.righton options, changes in payments due to renegotiat/i.rightons of market rental rates as permitted by those contracts and changes to payments due to rent being contractually linked to an inflat/i.righton index. In general the remeasurement of a lease liab/i.rightlity under these circumstances leads to an equal change to the right-of-use asset balance, with no immed/i.rightate effect on the income statement.\n\nThe total cash outflow during the year for premises and equipment leases was $352 mill/i.righton (2019: $397 mill/i.righton).\n\nThe total expense during the year in respect of leases with a term less than or equal to 12 months was less than $1 mill/i.righton (2019: $20 mill/i.righton).\n\nThe right-of-use asset balances and depreciat/i.righton charges are disclosed in Note 18. The lease liab/i.rightlity balances are disclosed in Note 23 and the interest expense on lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes is disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nThe maturity profile for lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes associated with leased premises and equipment assets is as follows:\n\n|                                                                   | 2020                                 | 2020                                                 | 2020                                                   | 2020                                     | 2020                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                   | One year   or less   $mill/i.righton | Between   one year   and two years   $mill/i.righton | Between   two years   and five years   $mill/i.righton | More than   five years   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton |\n| Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes - lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes | 368                                  | 280                                                  | 559                                                    | 188                                      | 1,395                   |\n|                                                                   | restated 2019 1                      | restated 2019 1                                      | restated 2019 1                                        | restated 2019 1                          | restated 2019 1         |\n|                                                                   | One year   or less   $mill/i.righton | Between   one year   and two years   $mill/i.righton | Between   two years   and five years   $mill/i.righton | More than   five years   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton |\n| Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes - lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes | 364                                  | 335                                                  | 626                                                    | 325                                      | 1,650                   |",

Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group recognises a provis/i.righton for a present legal or constructive obligat/i.righton resulting from a past event when it is more likely than not that it will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the obligat/i.righton and the amount of the obligat/i.righton can be estimated reliably. Where a liab/i.rightlity arises based on partic/i.rightpation in a market at a specif/i.righted date, the obligat/i.righton is recognised in the financ/i.rightal statements on that date and is not accrued over the period.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe recognit/i.righton and measurement of provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges requires sign/i.rightficant judgement and the use of estimates about uncertain future condit/i.rightons or events.\n\nEstimates include the best estimate of the probabil/i.rightty of outflow of economic resources, cost of settling a provis/i.righton and tim/i.rightng of settlement. Judgements are required for inherently uncertain areas such as legal decis/i.rightons (includ/i.rightng external advice obtained), and outcome of regulator reviews.\n\n|                                   | 2020                                                        | 2020                                       | 2020                   | 2019                                                        | 2019                                       | 2019                   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | Provis/i.righton   for credit  commitments  $mill/i.righton | Other   provis/i.rightons  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Provis/i.righton   for credit  commitments  $mill/i.righton | Other   provis/i.rightons  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| At 1 January                      | 317                                                         | 132                                        | 449                    | 281                                                         | 1,049                                      | 1,330                  |\n| Exchange translation differences  | (50)                                                        | (3)                                        | (53)                   | 5                                                           | 4                                          | 9                      |\n| Transfer                          | -                                                           | 9                                          | 9                      | -                                                           | -                                          | -                      |\n| Charge against profit             | 103                                                         | 22                                         | 125                    | 35                                                          | 239                                        | 274                    |\n| Provis/i.rightons util/i.rightsed | (3)                                                         | (61)                                       | (64)                   | (4)                                                         | (1,160)                                    | (1,164)                |\n| At 31 December                    | 367                                                         | 99                                         | 466                    | 317                                                         | 132                                        | 449                    |\n\nProvis/i.righton for credit commitment comprises those undrawn contractually committed facil/i.rightties where there is doubt as to the borrowers' abil/i.rightty to meet their repayment obligat/i.rightons.\n\nOther provis/i.rightons consist mainly of provis/i.rightons for regulatory settlements and legal claims, the nature of which are described in Note 26 (page 378).",

Contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and commitments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Group issues financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are in/i.righttially recognised at their fair value as a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity, and subsequently measured at the higher of the in/i.righttial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the princ/i.rightples of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and their expected credit loss provis/i.righton. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held. Notional values of financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments are disclosed in the table below.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit are the notional values of contracts issued by the Group's Transaction Banking business for which an obligat/i.righton to make a payment has not arisen at the reporting date. Transaction Banking will issue contracts to clients and counterparties of clients, whereby in the event the holder of the contract is not paid, the Group will reimburse the holder of the contract for the actual financ/i.rightal loss suffered. These contracts have various legal forms such as letters of credit, guarantee contracts and performance bonds. The contracts are issued to facil/i.righttate trade through export and import business, provide guarantees to financ/i.rightal inst/i.righttutions where the Group has a local presence, as well as guaranteeing project financ/i.rightng involv/i.rightng large construction projects undertaken by sovereigns and corporates. The contracts may contain performance clauses which require the counterparty performing services or provid/i.rightng goods to meet certain condit/i.rightons before a right to payment is achieved, however the Group does not guarantee this performance. The Group will only guarantee the credit of the counterparty paying for the services or goods.\n\nCommitments are where the Group has confirmed its intent/i.righton to provide funds to a customer or on behalf of a customer under prespecif/i.righted terms and condit/i.rightons in the form of loans, overdrafts, future guarantees whether cancellable or not and the Group has not made payments at the balance sheet date; those instruments are included in these financ/i.rightal statements as commitments. Commitments and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are generally considered on demand as the Group may have to honour them, or the client may draw down at any time.\n\nCapital commitments are contractual commitments the Group has entered into to purchase non-financ/i.rightal assets.\n\nThe table below shows the contract or underlying princ/i.rightpal amounts of unmatured off-balance sheet transactions at the balance sheet date. The contract or underlying princ/i.rightpal amounts ind/i.rightcate the volume of business outstanding and do not represent amounts at risk.\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | Restated   2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Financ/i.rightal guarantees and trade credits                                                     |                         |                                    |\n| Financ/i.rightal guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit                      | 53,832                  | 46,714\u00b9                            |\n|                                                                                                   | 53,832                  | 46,714                             |\n| Commitments                                                                                       |                         |                                    |\n| Undrawn formal standby facil/i.rightties, credit lines and other commitments to lend              |                         |                                    |\n| One year and over                                                                                 | 68,848                  | 64,450                             |\n| Less than one year                                                                                | 24,500                  | 19,520\u00b2                            |\n| Uncondit/i.rightonally cancellable                                                                | 60,055                  | 57, 2 24 \u00b2                         |\n|                                                                                                   | 153,403                 | 141,194                            |\n| Capital commitments                                                                               |                         |                                    |\n| Contracted capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in these accounts 3 | 135                     | 419                                |\n\nThe Group's share of contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and commitments relating to jo/i.rightnt ventures is $ nil (31 December 2019: $251 mill/i.righton).

Legal and regulatory matters\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nWhere appropriate, the Group recognises a provis/i.righton for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources embodying economic benefits will be required and for which a reliable estimate can be made of the obligat/i.righton. The uncertaint/i.rightes inherent in legal and regulatory matters affect the amount and tim/i.rightng of any potential outflows with respect to which provis/i.rightons have been established. These uncertaint/i.rightes also mean that it is not possible to give an aggregate estimate of contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes aris/i.rightng from such legal and regulatory matters.\n\nThe Group receives legal claims against it in a number of jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons and is subject to regulatory and enforcement invest/i.rightgations and proceedings from time to time. Apart from the matters described below, the Group currently considers none of the ongoing claims, invest/i.rightgations or proceedings to be material. However, in light of the uncertaint/i.rightes involved in such matters there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters currently not considered to be material may not ultimately be material to the Group's results in a particular reporting period depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the results otherwise reported for such period.\n\nThe Group is a defendant in a number of lawsuits that have been filed since 2014 in the United States Distr/i.rightct Courts for the Southern and Eastern Distr/i.rightcts of New York, against a number of banks on behalf of plaint/i.rightffs who are, or are relatives of, vict/i.rightms of various terrorist attacks in Iraq. The plaint/i.rightffs allege that the defendant banks aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of US sanctioned parties in breach of the US Anti-Terrorism Act. One lawsuit has been withdrawn by the plaint/i.rightffs and the courts have ruled in favour of the banks' motions to dism/i.rightss in five of the lawsuits. Following those rulings, in one lawsuit the plaint/i.rightffs appealed against the dism/i.rightssal and a ruling on their appeal is awaited. Appeals are also expected by the plaint/i.rightffs in three of the other dism/i.rightssed lawsuits. The remain/i.rightng lawsuits are still at an early procedural stage and have been stayed pending the outcomes of the appeals in the dism/i.rightssed cases.\n\nIn January 2020, a shareholder derivat/i.rightve complaint was filed in the New York State Court against 45 current and former directors and senior officers of the Group. It is alleged that the ind/i.rightviduals breached their duties to the Group and caused a waste of corporate assets by permitt/i.rightng the conduct that gave rise to the costs and losses to the Group related to legacy conduct and control issues. Standard Chartered PLC, Standard Chartered Holdings Lim/i.rightted and Standard Chartered Bank are each named as 'nominal defendants' in the complaint. The case is at an early procedural stage. On 23 December 2020, the Group filed a motion to dism/i.rightss the complaint.\n\nIn October 2020, a claim was filed in the English High Court by 249 shareholders against Standard Chartered PLC alleging untrue and/or mislead/i.rightng statements were made, and/or there were omiss/i.rightons in informat/i.righton published by Standard Chartered PLC in its rights issue prospectuses of 2008, 2010 and 2015 and/or public statements regarding the Group's histor/i.rightc sanctions, anti-money laundering and financ/i.rightal crime compliance issues. The case is at an early stage.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not possible for the Group to predict the outcome of these lawsuits.",

Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nFinanc/i.rightal instruments issued are classif/i.righted as equity when there is no contractual obligat/i.righton to transfer cash, other financ/i.rightal assets or issue available number of own equity instruments. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\n\nSecurit/i.rightes which carry a discret/i.rightonary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classif/i.righted as other equity instruments. Interest payments on these securit/i.rightes are recognised, net of tax, as distr/i.rightbutions from equity in the period in which they are paid.\n\nWhere the Company or other members of the consolidated Group purchase the Company's equity share capital, the considerat/i.righton paid is deducted from the total shareholders' equity of the Group and/or of the Company as treasury shares until they are cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any considerat/i.righton received is included in shareholders' equity of the Group and/or the Company.\n\n|                                                          | Number of  ordinary   shares  mill/i.rightons   | Ordinary   share   capital 1 $mill/i.righton   | Ordinary   share   premium  $mill/i.righton   | Preference   share   premium 2 $mill/i.righton   | Total   share capital   and share  premium  $mill/i.righton   | Other   equity  instruments  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| At 1 January 2019                                        | 3,308                                           | 1,654                                          | 3,963                                         | 1,494                                            | 7,111                                                         | 4,961                                          |\n| Shares issued                                            | 4                                               | 2                                              | 23                                            | -                                                | 25                                                            | -                                              |\n| Cancellation of shares includ/i.rightng   share buy-back | (116)                                           | (58)                                           | -                                             | -                                                | (58)                                                          | -                                              |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 equity securit/i.rightes        | -                                               | -                                              | -                                             | -                                                | -                                                             | 552                                            |\n| At 31 December 2019                                      | 3,196                                           | 1,598                                          | 3,986                                         | 1,494                                            | 7,078                                                         | 5,513                                          |\n| Cancellation of shares includ/i.rightng   share buy-back | (40)                                            | (20)                                           | -                                             | -                                                | (20)                                                          | -                                              |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 equity issuance                 | -                                               | -                                              | -                                             | -                                                | -                                                             | 992                                            |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 redemption                      | -                                               | -                                              | -                                             | -                                                | -                                                             | (1,987)                                        |\n| At 31 December 2020                                      | 3,156                                           | 1,578                                          | 3,986                                         | 1,494                                            | 7,058                                                         | 4,518                                          |\n\n- 1 Issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 cents each\n- 2   Includes preference share capital of $75,000",

Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves continued\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nOn 28 February 2020, the Group announced the buy-back programme for a share buy-back of its ordinary shares of $0.50 each. Nominal value of share purchases was $20 mill/i.righton, and the total considerat/i.righton paid was $242 mill/i.righton. The total number of shares purchased was 40,029,585 representing 1.25 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue. The nominal value of the shares was transferred from the share capital to the capital redemption reserve account. On 31 March 2020, the Group announced that in response to a request from the Prudential Regulation Authority and as a consequence of the unprecedented challenges facing the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, its Board had decided after careful considerat/i.righton to withdraw the recommendation to pay a final div/i.rightdend for 2019 of 20 cents per ordinary share and to suspend the buy-back programme.\n\n| Share buy-back of 2020   | Number of  ordinary   shares   |   Average price  paid per share  \u00a3 | Aggregate   price paid  \u00a3   | Aggregate   price paid  $   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Mar - 2020               | 40,029,585                     |                            4.89428 | 195,916,167                 | 241,705,472                 |\n\n## Ordinary share capital\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 the Company does not have authorised share capital. The nominal value of each ordinary share is 50 cents.\n\nDuring the period nil shares were issued under employee share plans.\n\n## Preference share capital\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Company has 15,000 $5 non-cumulative redeemable preference shares in issue, with a premium of $99,995 making a paid-up amount per preference share of $100,000. The preference shares are redeemable at the option of the Company and are classif/i.righted in equity.\n\nThe available profits of the Company are distr/i.rightbuted to the holders of the issued preference shares in prior/i.rightty to payments made to holders of the ordinary shares and in prior/i.rightty to, or pari passu with, any payments to the holders of any other class of shares in issue. On a wind/i.rightng up, the assets of the Company are applied to the holders of the preference shares in prior/i.rightty to any payment to the ordinary shareholders and in prior/i.rightty to, or pari passu with, the holders of any other shares in issue, for an amount equal to any div/i.rightdends payable (on approval of the board) and the nominal value of the shares together with any premium as determined by the Board. The redeemable preference shares are redeemable at the paid up amount (which includes premium) at the option of the Company in accordance with the terms of the shares. The holders of the preference shares are not entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting except where any relevant div/i.rightdend due is not paid in full or where a resolution is proposed varying the rights of the preference shares.\n\n## Other equity instruments\n\nOn 2 April 2015, Standard Chartered PLC issued $2,000 mill/i.righton Fixed Rate Resetting Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securit/i.rightes as Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 (AT1) securit/i.rightes, rais/i.rightng $1,987 mill/i.righton after issue costs.

The first reset date for the interest rate is 26 July 2025 and each date falling five years, or an integral multiple of five years, after the first reset date.\n- \u00b7 Interest on the securit/i.rightes are accounted for as a div/i.rightdend and it is due and payable only at the sole and absolute discret/i.righton of Standard Chartered PLC, subject to certain addit/i.rightonal restrict/i.rightons set out in the terms and condit/i.rightons.

The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of preference shares redeemed\n- \u00b7 The amounts in the 'Capital and Merger Reserve' represent the premium aris/i.rightng on shares issued using a cash box financ/i.rightng structure, which required the Company to create a merger reserve under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. Shares were issued using this structure in 2005 and 2006 to assist in the funding of Korea ($1.9 bill/i.righton) and Taiwan ($1.2 bill/i.righton) acquis/i.righttions, in 2008, 2010 and 2015 for the shares issued by way of a rights issue, primar/i.rightly for capital maintenance requirements and for the shares issued in 2009 by way of an accelerated book build, the proceeds of which were used in the ordinary course of business of the Group. The funding raised by the 2008, 2010 and 2015 rights issues and 2009 share issue was fully retained with/i.rightn the Company. Of the 2015 funding, $1.5 bill/i.righton was used to subscribe to addit/i.rightonal equity in Standard Chartered Bank, a wholly owned subsid/i.rightary of the Company. Apart from the Korea, Taiwan and Standard Chartered Bank funding, the merger reserve is considered realised and distr/i.rightbutable.\n- \u00b7 Own credit adjustment reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit. Gains and losses on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit in the year have been taken through other comprehensive income into this reserve. On derecognit/i.righton of applicable instruments, the balance of any OCA will not be recycled to the income statement, but will be transferred with/i.rightn equity to retained earnings\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) debt reserve represents the unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financ/i.rightal assets classif/i.righted as FVOCI, net of expected credit losses and taxation. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassif/i.righted to the income statement when the underlying asset is sold, matures or becomes impa/i.rightred.\n- \u00b7 FVOCI equity reserve represents unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financ/i.rightal assets classif/i.righted as FVOCI, net of taxation. Gains and losses are recorded in this reserve and never recycled to the income statement\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of the gains and losses on derivat/i.rightves that meet the criter/i.righta for these types of hedges. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassif/i.righted to the income statement when the underlying hedged item affects profit and loss or when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur\n- \u00b7 Translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the Group in foreign operations. Since 1 January 2004, gains and losses are deferred to this reserve and are reclassif/i.righted to the income statement when the underlying foreign operation is disposed. Gains and losses aris/i.rightng from derivat/i.rightves used as hedges of net investments are netted against the foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the foreign operations\n- \u00b7 Retained earnings represents profits and other comprehensive income earned by the Group and Company in the current and prior periods, together with the after tax increase relating to equity-settled share options, less div/i.rightdend distr/i.rightbutions, own shares held (treasury shares) and share buy-backs\n\nA substantial part of the Group's reserves is held in overseas subsid/i.rightary undertakings and branches, princ/i.rightpally to support local operations or to comply with local regulations. The maintenance of local regulatory capital ratios could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can be remitted. In addit/i.righton, if these overseas reserves were to be remitted, further unprovided taxation liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes might arise.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the distr/i.rightbutable reserves of Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) were $14.3 bill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $14.3 bill/i.righton). These comprised retained earnings and $12.6 bill/i.righton of the merger reserve account. Distr/i.rightbution of reserves is subject to mainta/i.rightning min/i.rightmum capital requirements.",

Retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group operates pension and other post-retirement benefit plans around the world, which can be categorised into defined contribut/i.righton plans and defined benefit plans. For defined contribut/i.righton plans, the Group pays contribut/i.rightons to publicly or privately admin/i.rightstered pension plans on a statutory or contractual basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses. The Group has no further payment obligat/i.rightons once the contribut/i.rightons have been paid.\n\nFor funded defined benefit plans, the liab/i.rightlity recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligat/i.righton at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. For unfunded defined benefit plans the liab/i.rightlity recognised at the balance sheet date is the present value of the defined benefit obligat/i.righton.\n\nThe defined benefit obligat/i.righton is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.\n\nActuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders' equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period they arise. The Group determines the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liab/i.rightlity for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligat/i.righton at the beginn/i.rightng of the annual period to the net defined benefit liab/i.rightlity, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liab/i.rightlity during the year as a result of contribut/i.rightons and benefit payments. Net interest expense, the cost of the accrual of new benefits, benefit enhancements (or reductions) and admin/i.rightstration expenses met directly from plan assets are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they were incurred.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThere are many factors that affect the measurement of the retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons. This measurement requires the use of estimates, such as discount rates, inflat/i.righton, pension increases, salary increases, and life expectancies which are inherently uncertain. Discount rates are determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality corporate bonds (or, in countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, government bonds) of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the post-employment benefit obligat/i.rightons. This is the approach adopted across our geographies. Where there are inflat/i.righton-linked bonds available (e.g. United Kingdom and the eurozone), the Group derives inflat/i.righton based on the market on those bonds, with the market yield adjusted in respect of the United Kingdom to take account of the fact that liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are linked to Consumer Price Index inflat/i.righton, whereas the reference bonds are linked to Retail Price Index inflat/i.righton. Where no inflat/i.righton-linked bonds exist, we determine inflat/i.righton assumptions based on a combinat/i.righton of long-term forecasts and short-term inflat/i.righton data. Salary growth assumptions reflect the Group's long-term expectations, taking into account future business plans and macroeconomic data (primar/i.rightly expected future long-term inflat/i.righton). Demographic assumptions, includ/i.rightng mortality and turnover rates, are typically set based on the assumptions used in the most recent actuarial funding valuation, and will generally use industry standard tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect recent histor/i.rightc experience and/or future expectations. The sensit/i.rightvity of the liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes to changes in these assumptions is shown in the Note below.",

The aim of all these plans is, as part of the Group's commitment to financ/i.rightal wellbeing for employees, to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market condit/i.rightons. The defined benefit plans expose the Group to currency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as Longevity Risk.\n\nThe material holdings of government and corporate bonds shown on page 389 partially hedge movements in the liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes resulting from interest rate and inflat/i.righton changes. Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency fluctuation, the reductions in discount rates in most geographies over 2020 have led to higher liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. These have been largely offset by increases in the value of bonds held and good stock market performance. These movements are shown as actuarial losses versus gains respectively in the tables below. Contribut/i.rightons into a number of plans in excess of the amounts required to fund benefits accruing have also helped to reduce the net defic/i.rightt over the year.\n\nThe disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent qualif/i.righted actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2020.\n\n## UK Fund\n\nThe Standard Chartered Pension Fund (the 'UK Fund') is the Group's largest pension plan, representing 63 per cent (31 December 2019: 60 per cent) of total pension liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. The UK Fund is set up under a trust that is legally separate from the Bank (its formal sponsor) and, as required by UK legislat/i.righton, at least one-third of the trustee directors are nominated by members; the remainder are appointed by the Bank. The trustee directors have a fiduc/i.rightary duty to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.\n\nThe UK Fund was closed to new entrants from 1 July 1998 and closed to the accrual of new benefits from 1 April 2018: all employees are now offered membership of a defined contribut/i.righton plan.\n\nThe financ/i.rightal posit/i.righton of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent qualif/i.righted actuary. The funding valuation as at 31 December 2017 was completed in December 2018 by the then Scheme Actuary, A Zegleman of Will/i.rights Towers Watson, using assumptions different from those on page 388, and agreed with the UK Fund trustee. It showed that the UK Fund was 89% funded at that date revealing a past service defic/i.rightt of $210 mill/i.righton (\u00a3159 mill/i.righton). To repair the defic/i.rightt, four annual cash payments of $42.2 mill/i.righton (\u00a332.9 mill/i.righton) were agreed, with three of these having been paid in December 2018, December 2019 and December 2020. The agreement allows that if the funding posit/i.righton improves to being at or near a surplus in future years the payments due in December 2021 will be reduced or elim/i.rightnated. In addit/i.righton, an escrow account of $150 mill/i.righton (\u00a3110 mill/i.righton) exists to provide security for future contribut/i.rightons. The 31 December 2020 funding valuation is currently underway and may conclude by altering, or adding to, the cash payment due in 2021. Its analysis of mortality experience has driven the small adjustment to life expectancy assumptions shown below.\n\nThe Group is not required to recognise any addit/i.rightonal liab/i.rightlity under IFRIC 14 or the 2015 exposure draft of proposed amendments to it, as the Bank has control of any pension surplus under the Trust Deed and Rules.\n\n## Overseas plans\n\nThe princ/i.rightpal overseas defined benefit arrangements operated by the Group are in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States of America (US). Plans in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Taiwan and UAE remain open for accrual of future benefits.",

For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligat/i.righton by the amounts shown below:\n\n- \u00b7 If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liab/i.rightlity would reduce by approximately $75 mill/i.righton for the UK Fund (31/uni00A0December 2019: $65 mill/i.righton) and $40 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2019: $35 mill/i.righton)\n- \u00b7 If the rate of inflat/i.righton increased by 25 basis points the liab/i.rightlity, allowing for the consequent impact on pension and salary increases would increase by approximately $50 mill/i.righton for the UK Fund (31 December 2019: $45 mill/i.righton) and $25 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2019: $25 mill/i.righton)\n- \u00b7 If the rate salaries increase compared to inflat/i.righton increased by 25 basis points the liab/i.rightlity would increase by nil for the UK Fund (31 December 2019: nil) and approximately $15 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2019: $15 mill/i.righton)\n- \u00b7 If longevity expectations increased by one year the liab/i.rightlity would increase by approximately $70 mill/i.righton for the UK Fund (31/uni00A0December 2019: $60 mill/i.righton) and $20 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2019: $15 mill/i.righton)\n\nAlthough this analysis does not take account of the full distr/i.rightbution of cash flows expected, it does provide an approximat/i.righton of the sensit/i.rightvity to the main assumptions. While changes in other assumptions would also have an impact, the effect would not be as sign/i.rightficant.",

The fair value of the employee services (measured by the fair value of the awards granted) received in exchange for the grant of the shares and awards is recognised as an expense. For deferred share awards granted as part of an annual performance award, the expense is recognised over the period from the start of the performance period to the vesting date. For example, the expense for three-year awards granted in 2021 in respect of 2020 performance, which vest in 2022-24, is recognised as an expense over the period from 1 January 2020 to the vesting dates in 2022-24. For all other awards, the expense is recognised over the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and awards at the date of grant, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting condit/i.rightons (for example, profitab/i.rightlity and growth targets). The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a binom/i.rightal option pric/i.rightng model. Non-market vesting condit/i.rightons are included in assumptions for the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revis/i.righton of orig/i.rightnal estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remain/i.rightng vesting period. Forfeitures prior to vesting attributable to factors other than the failure to satisfy service condit/i.rightons and non-market vesting condit/i.rightons are treated as a cancellation and the remain/i.rightng unamortised charge is debited to the income statement at the time of cancellation. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when awards in the form of options are exercised.\n\nCash-settled awards are revalued at each balance sheet date and a liab/i.rightlity recognised on the balance sheet for all unpaid amounts, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to staff costs in the income statement until the awards are exercised. Where forfeitures occur prior to vesting that are attributable to factors other than a failure to satisfy service condit/i.rightons or market-based performance condit/i.rightons, the cumulative charge incurred up to the date of forfeiture is credited to the income statement. Any revaluation related to cash-settled awards is recorded as an amount due from subsid/i.rightary undertakings.\n\nThe Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its executive directors and employees. Details of the sharebased payment charge are set out below.\n\n|                            | 2020\u00b9                  | 2020\u00b9                    | 2020\u00b9                   | 2019\u00b9                  | 2019\u00b9                    | 2019\u00b9                   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                            | Cash   $mill/i.righton | Equity   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton | Cash   $mill/i.righton | Equity   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton |\n| Deferred share awards      | (1)                    | 59                       | 58                      | 13                     | 88                       | 101                     |\n| Other share awards         | (1)                    | 75                       | 74                      | 12                     | 53                       | 65                      |\n| Total share-based payments | (2)                    | 134                      | 132                     | 25                     | 141                      | 166                     |\n\n## 2011 Standard Chartered Share Plan (the '2011 Plan')\n\nThe 2011 Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2011 and is the Group's main share plan. Since approval, it has been used to deliver various types of share awards:\n\n- \u00b7 Long term incent/i.rightve plan (LTIP) awards: granted with vesting subject to performance measures. Performance measures attached to awards granted previously include: total shareholder return (TSR); return on equity (RoE) and return on tangible equity (RoTE) (in the case of both RoE and RoTE, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) underpin); strategic measures; earnings per share (EPS) growth; and return on risk-weighted assets (RoRWA). Each measure is assessed independently over a three-year period. Awards granted from 2016 have an ind/i.rightvidual conduct gateway requirement that results in the award lapsing if not met\n- \u00b7 Deferred awards are used to deliver the deferred portion of variable remuneration, in line with both market practice and regulatory requirements. These awards vest in instalments on anniversar/i.rightes of the award date specif/i.righted at the time of grant. Deferred awards are not subject to any plan lim/i.rightt. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to deferral levels, and is in line with market practice\n- \u00b7 Restricted share awards, made outside of the annual performance process as replacement buy-out awards to new jo/i.rightners who forfeit awards on leaving their previous employers, vest in instalments on the anniversar/i.rightes of the award date specif/i.righted at the time of grant. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to buy-outs, and is in line with market practice. In line with sim/i.rightlar plans operated by our competitors, restricted share awards are not subject to an annual lim/i.rightt and do not have any performance measures\n\nUnder the 2011 Plan, no grant price is payable to receive an award. The remain/i.rightng life of the 2011 Plan during which new awards can be made is one year.",

Share-based payments continued\n\n## Valuation - LTIP awards\n\nThe vesting of awards granted in both 2020 and 2019 is subject to relative TSR performance measures and achievement of a strategic scorecard. The vesting of awards granted in 2019 and 2020 are subject to the satisfact/i.righton of RoTE (subject to a capital CET1 underpin). The fair value of the TSR component is calculated using the probabil/i.rightty of meeting the measures over a three-year performance period, using a Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton model. The number of shares expected to vest is evaluated at each reporting date, based on the expected performance against the RoTE and strategic measures in the scorecard, to determine the accounting charge.\n\nNo div/i.rightdend equivalents accrue for the LTIP awards made in 2019 or 2020 and the fair value takes this into account, calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield.\n\n| Grant date                        | 2020 09 March   | 2019 11 March   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3)     | 5.20            | 6.11            |\n| Vesting period (years)            | 3-7             | 3-7             |\n| Expected div/i.rightded yield (%) | 4.2             | 4.2             |\n| Fair value (RoTE) (\u00a3)             | 1.40, 1.34      | 2.02, 2.02      |\n| Fair value (TSR) (\u00a3)              | 0.75, 0.72      | 0.97, 0.91      |\n| Fair value (Strategic) (\u00a3)        | 1.40, 1.34      | 2.02, 2.02      |\n\n## Valuation - deferred shares and restricted shares\n\nThe fair value for deferred awards which are not granted to material risk-takers is based on 100 per cent of the face value of the shares at the date of grant as the share price will reflect expectations of all future div/i.rightdends. For awards granted to material risk-takers in 2020, the fair value of awards takes into account the lack of div/i.rightdend equivalents, calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield.\n\n## Deferred share awards\n\n|                               | 2020                                    | 2020             | 2020                                    | 2020             | 2020                                    | 2020                      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Grant date                    | 22 June                                 | 22 June          | 30 March                                | 30 March         | 9 March                                 | 9 March                   |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 4.27                                    | 4.27             | 4.67                                    | 4.67             | 5.20                                    | 5.20                      |\n| Vesting period (years)        | Expected  div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3)          |\n| 1-3 years                     | NA                                      | 4.27             | NA,4.2                                  | 4.67,4.13        |                                         | NA,4.2,4.2 5.20,4.79,4.59 |\n| 1-5 years                     | -                                       | -                | 4.2                                     | 4.04             | 4.2,4.2                                 | 4.59,4.50                 |\n| 3-7 years                     | -                                       | -                | -                                       | -                | 4.2,4.2                                 | 4.23,4.06                 |\n|                               |                                         |                  | 2019                                    | 2019             | 2019                                    | 2019                      |\n| Grant date                    |                                         |                  | 24 June                                 | 24 June          | 11 March                                | 11 March                  |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) |                                         |                  | 7. 0 3                                  | 7. 0 3           | 6.11                                    | 6.11                      |\n| Vesting period (years)        |                                         |                  | Expected  div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3)          |\n| 1-3 years                     |                                         |                  | N/A,4.2,4.2                             | 7.03,6.47,6.21   | N/A,4.2,4.2                             | 6.11,5.62,5.40            |\n| 1-5 years                     |                                         |                  | -                                       | -                | 4.2,4.2                                 | 5.29,5.40                 |\n| 3-7 years                     |                                         |                  | -                                       | -                | 4.2,4.2                                 | 4.77,4.97                 |",

With/i.rightn a maturity period of six months after the third anniversary, employees may save up to \u00a3250 per month over three years to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20 per cent on the share price at the date of inv/i.righttation (this is known as the 'option exercise price'). There are no performance measures attached to options granted under the 2013 Sharesave Plan and no grant price is payable to receive an option. In some countries in which the Group operates, it is not possible to operate Sharesave plans, typically due to securit/i.rightes law and regulatory restrict/i.rightons. In these countries, where possible, the Group offers an equivalent cash-based plan to its employees.\n\nThe 2013 Sharesave Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2013 and all future Sharesave inv/i.righttations are made under this plan. The remain/i.rightng life of the 2013 Sharesave Plan is two years.\n\n## Valuation - Sharesave:\n\nOptions under the Sharesave plans are valued using a binom/i.rightal option-pric/i.rightng model. The same fair value is applied to all employees includ/i.rightng executive directors. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:\n\n## All Employee Sharesave Plan (Sharesave)\n\n|                                    | 2020         | 2019      |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Grant date                         | 30 September | 1 October |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3)      | 3.52         | 6.84      |\n| Exercise price (\u00a3)                 | 3.14         | 4.98      |\n| Vesting period (years)             | 3            | 3         |\n| Expected volatil/i.rightty (%)     | 31.8         | 25.3      |\n| Expected option life (years)       | 3.33         | 3.33      |\n| Risk-free rate (%)                 | (0.07)       | 0.26      |\n| Expected div/i.rightdend yield (%) | 4.2          | 4.2       |\n| Fair value (\u00a3)                     | 0.69         | 1.62      |\n\nThe expected volatil/i.rightty is based on histor/i.rightcal volatil/i.rightty over the last three years, or three years prior to grant. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. The expected div/i.rightdend yield is calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield.",

Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Subsid/i.rightaries\n\nSubsid/i.rightaries are all entit/i.rightes, includ/i.rightng structured entit/i.rightes, which the Group controls. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, and has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the abil/i.rightty to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The assessment of power is based on the Group's practical abil/i.rightty to direct the relevant activ/i.rightties of the entity unilaterally for the Group's own benefit and is subject to reassessment if and when one or more of the elements of control change. Subsid/i.rightaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases, and where any interest in the subsid/i.rightary remains, this is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Associates and jo/i.rightnt arrangements\n\nJoint arrangements are where two or more parties either have rights to the assets, and obligat/i.rightons of the jo/i.rightnt arrangement (jo/i.rightnt operations), or have rights to the net assets of the jo/i.rightnt arrangement (jo/i.rightnt venture). The Group evaluates the contractual terms of jo/i.rightnt arrangements to determine whether a jo/i.rightnt arrangement is a jo/i.rightnt operation or a jo/i.rightnt venture. The Group did not have any contractual interest in jo/i.rightnt operations.\n\n## An associate is an entity over which the Group has sign/i.rightficant influence.\n\nInvestments in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are in/i.righttially recognised at cost. The Group's investment in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures includes goodwill ident/i.rightfied on acquis/i.righttion (net of any accumulated impa/i.rightrment loss).\n\nThe Group's share of its associates' and jo/i.rightnt ventures' post-acquis/i.righttion profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquis/i.righttion movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquis/i.righttion movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associate or a jo/i.rightnt venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, includ/i.rightng any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligat/i.rightons or made payments on behalf of the associate or jo/i.rightnt venture.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures are elim/i.rightnated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures. At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any object/i.rightve evidence of impa/i.rightrment in the investment in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures. Such evidence includes a sign/i.rightficant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the Group's investment in an associate or jo/i.rightnt venture below its cost, among other factors.",

Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates continued\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group applies judgement in determin/i.rightng if it has control, jo/i.rightnt control or sign/i.rightficant influence over subsid/i.rightaries, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates respectively. These judgements are based upon ident/i.rightfying the relevant activ/i.rightties of counterparties, being those activ/i.rightties that sign/i.rightficantly affect the entit/i.rightes' returns, and further making a decis/i.righton of if the Group has control over those entit/i.rightes, jo/i.rightnt control, or has sign/i.rightficant influence (being the power to partic/i.rightpate in the financ/i.rightal and operating policy decis/i.rightons but not control them).\n\nThese judgements are at times determined by equity holdings, and the voting rights associated with those holdings. However, further considerat/i.rightons includ/i.rightng but not lim/i.rightted to board seats, advisory committee members and special/i.rightst knowledge of some decis/i.righton-makers are also taken into account. Further judgement is required when determin/i.rightng if the Group has de-facto control over an entity even though it may hold less than 50 per cent of the voting shares of that entity. Judgement is required to determine the relative size of the Group's shareholding when compared to the size and dispers/i.righton of other shareholders.\n\nImpairment testing of investments in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures is performed if there is a possible ind/i.rightcator of impa/i.rightrment. Judgement is used to determine if there is object/i.rightve evidence of impa/i.rightrment. Object/i.rightve evidence may be observable data such as losses incurred on the investment when applying the equity method, the granting of concessions as a result of financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculty, or breaches of contracts/regulatory fines of the associate or jo/i.rightnt venture. Further judgement is required when consider/i.rightng broader ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment such as losses of active markets or ratings downgrades across key markets in which the associate or jo/i.rightnt venture operate.\n\nImpairment testing is based on estimates includ/i.rightng forecasting the expected cash flows from the investments, growth rates, terminal values and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash flows. The estimat/i.righton of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires sign/i.rightficant judgement.\n\n## Business combinat/i.rightons\n\nThe acquis/i.righttion method of accounting is used to account for the acquis/i.righttion of subsid/i.rightaries by the Group. The cost of an acquis/i.righttion is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together with the fair value of any contingent considerat/i.righton payable. The excess of the cost of acquis/i.righttion over the fair value of the Group's share of the ident/i.rightfiable net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes acquired is recorded as goodwill (see Note 17 for details on goodwill recognised by the Group). If the cost of acquis/i.righttion is less than the fair value of the net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the subsid/i.rightary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nWhere the fair values of the ident/i.rightfiable net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes acquired have been determined provis/i.rightonally, or where contingent or deferred considerat/i.righton is payable, adjustments aris/i.rightng from their subsequent final/i.rightsation are not reflected in the income statement if: (i) they arise with/i.rightn 12 months of the acquis/i.righttion date (or relate to acquis/i.righttions completed before 1 January 2014); and (i/i.right) the adjustments arise from better informat/i.righton about condit/i.rightons exist/i.rightng at the acquis/i.righttion date (measurement period adjustments). Such adjustments are applied as at the date of acquis/i.righttion and, if applicable, prior year amounts are restated. All changes that are not measurement period adjustments are reported in income other than changes in contingent considerat/i.righton not classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal instruments, which are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting policy, and changes in contingent considerat/i.righton classif/i.righted as equity, which is not remeasured.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in a subsid/i.rightary, which do not result in a loss of control, are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity. Where a business combinat/i.righton is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at the acquis/i.righttion date fair value with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the income statement.\n\nIn the Company's financ/i.rightal statements, investment in subsid/i.rightaries, associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures are held at cost less impa/i.rightrment and div/i.rightdends from pre-acquis/i.righttion profits received prior to 1 January 2009, if any. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are elim/i.rightnated in the Group accounts.\n\n| Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| As at 1 January                                 | 58,037                  | 34,853                  |\n| Addit/i.rightons 1                              | 1,370                   | 23,184                  |\n| Disposal 2                                      | (2,000)                 | -                       |\n| As at 31 December                               | 57,407                  | 58,037                  |",

This contributes $13 mill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $20 mill/i.righton) of the profit attributable to non-controlling interests and $111 mill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $111 mill/i.righton) of the equity attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nWhile the Group's subsid/i.rightaries are subject to local statutory capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements in relation to foreign exchange remittance, these restrict/i.rightons arise in the normal course of business and do not sign/i.rightficantly restrict the Group's abil/i.rightty to access or use assets and settle liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the Group.\n\nThe Group does not have sign/i.rightficant restrict/i.rightons on its abil/i.rightty to access or use its assets and settle its liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes other than those resulting from the regulatory framework with/i.rightn which the banking subsid/i.rightaries operate. These frameworks require banking operations to keep certain levels of regulatory capital, liqu/i.rightd assets, exposure lim/i.rightts and comply with other required ratios. These restrict/i.rightons are summarised below:\n\n## Regulatory and liqu/i.rightdity requirements\n\nThe Group's subsid/i.rightaries are required to mainta/i.rightn min/i.rightmum capital, leverage ratios, liqu/i.rightdity and exposure ratios which therefore restrict the abil/i.rightty of these subsid/i.rightaries to distr/i.rightbute cash or other assets to the parent company.\n\nThe subsid/i.rightaries are also required to mainta/i.rightn balances with central banks and other regulatory authorit/i.rightes in the countries in which they operate. At 31 December 2020, the total cash and balances with central banks was $67 bill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $53 bill/i.righton) of which $7 bill/i.righton (31 December 2019: $10 bill/i.righton) is restricted.\n\n## Statutory requirements\n\nThe Group's subsid/i.rightaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distr/i.rightbutions of capital and unrealised profits to the parent company, generally to mainta/i.rightn solvency. These requirements restrict the abil/i.rightty of subsid/i.rightaries to remit div/i.rightdends to the Group. Certain subsid/i.rightaries are also subject to local exchange control regulations which provide for restrict/i.rightons on exporting capital from the country other than through normal div/i.rightdends.",

This influence is through board representation and the provis/i.righton of technical expertise to Bohai. The Group applies the equity method of accounting for investments in associates.\n\nThe Group's ownership percentage decreased to 16.26 per cent from 19.99 per cent as a result of the IPO which was completed on the 16 July 2020 in which the Group did not partic/i.rightpate. A $35 mill/i.righton loss was recognised on the dilut/i.righton of the Group's ownership percentage as the IPO price was based on the net asset value of Bohai at 31 December 2019.\n\nThe Group has recognised 19.99 per cent of Bohai's earnings through the date of the IPO after which it has recognised 16.26 per cent of Bohai's earnings. Bohai has a statutory year end of 31 December, but Bohai publishes their results after the Group. For the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2019, the Group was on a one-month lag in recognis/i.rightng its share of Bohai's earnings. For the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group recognised Bohai's results through 30 September 2020 (10 months of earnings, includ/i.rightng December 2019). The Group will continue on a three-month lag in recognis/i.rightng its share of Bohai's earnings going forward.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the listed equity value of Bohai is below the carrying amount of the investment in associate. As a result, the Group has performed an impa/i.rightrment test on the carrying amount, which confirmed that there was no impa/i.rightrment at 31/uni00A0December 2020 as the recoverable amount as determined by a value-in-use ('VIU') calculation was higher than the carrying value.\n\nCarrying\n\n|       | ViU  $mill/i.righton   | amount  $mill/i.righton   | Fair value  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Bohai | 2,943                  | 2,025                     | 1,888                         |",

The VIU calculation uses three primary inputs, being;\n\n- \u00b7 Discounted short to medium term cash flow project/i.rightons based on management's best estimates of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders;\n- \u00b7 A discount rate representing the risk-free rate and company risk premiums, and;\n- \u00b7 A long term sustainable growth rate which is used to extrapolate in perpetuity those expected short to medium term earnings to derive a terminal value.\n\nFrom the estimated cash flows a capital maintenance haircut is taken in order for Bohai to meet its target regulatory capital requirements over the forecast period. This haircut takes into account movements in risk-weighted assets and the total capital required, includ/i.rightng retained earnings to meet the target capital ratios.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the VIU calculation:\n\n|                                    | %      |\n|------------------------------------|--------|\n| Discount rate                      | 10.00  |\n| Long term growth rate              | 5.00   |\n| Capital requirement adequacy ratio | 7. 5 0 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                          | Base case           | Base case                 | Base case      | Base case   | Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes 2020   | Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes 2020   | Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes 2020   | Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes 2020   | Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes 2020   | Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes 2020   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                          |                     |                           |                | GDP         | GDP                                | Discount rates                     | Discount rates                     | Discount rates                     | Cash flows                         | Cash flows                         |\n| Carrying                 |                     |                           |                |             | +1%                                | -1%                                | +1%                                | -1%                                | +10%                               | -10%                               |\n| amount   $mill/i.righton | VIU $mill/i.righton | Headroom  $mill/i.righton | Discount  Rate | GDP         | Headroom  $mill/i.righton          | Headroom  $mill/i.righton          | Headroom  $mill/i.righton          | Headroom  $mill/i.righton          | Headroom  $mill/i.righton          | Headroom  $mill/i.righton          |\n| 2,025                    | 2,943               | 918                       | 10%            | 5%          | 1,460                              | 557                                | 480                                | 1,573                              | 1,353                              | 483                                |\n\nThe following table sets out the summarised financ/i.rightal statements of China Bohai Bank prior to the Group's share of the associates being applied:\n\n|                                 | 30 Sep 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 30 Nov 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Total assets                    | 202,537                        | 156,429                        |\n| Total liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes | 1 8 7, 02 4                    | 1 47, 4 07                     |\n| Other equity instruments        | 3,053                          | 2,865                          |\n| Operating income                | 3,474                          | 3,769                          |\n| Net profit                      | 950                            | 1,163                          |\n| Other comprehensive income      | (121)                          | (63)                           |",

Structured entit/i.rightes\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or sim/i.rightlar rights are not the dominant factor in decid/i.rightng who controls the entity. Contractual arrangements determine the rights and therefore relevant activ/i.rightties of the structured entity. Structured entit/i.rightes are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined object/i.rightve with restrict/i.rightons around their activ/i.rightties. Structured entit/i.rightes are consolidated when the substance of the relationsh/i.rightp between the Group and the structured entity ind/i.rightcates the Group has power over the contractual relevant activ/i.rightties of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable return exposure.\n\nIn determin/i.rightng whether to consolidate a structured entity to which assets have been transferred, the Group takes into account its abil/i.rightty to direct the relevant activ/i.rightties of the structured entity. These relevant activ/i.rightties are generally evidenced through a unilateral right to liqu/i.rightdate the structured entity, investment in a substantial proportion of the securit/i.rightes issued by the structured entity or where the Group holds specif/i.rightc subordinate securit/i.rightes that embody certain controlling rights. The Group may further consider relevant activ/i.rightties embedded with/i.rightn contractual arrangements such as call options which give the practical abil/i.rightty to direct the entity, special relationsh/i.rightps between the structured entity and investors, and if a single investor has a large exposure to variable returns of the structured entity.\n\nJudgement is required in determin/i.rightng control over structured entit/i.rightes. The purpose and design of the entity is considered, along with a determinat/i.righton of what the relevant activ/i.rightties are of the entity and who directs these. Further judgements are made around which investor is exposed to, and absorbs the variable returns of the structured entity. The Group will have to weigh up all of these facts to consider whether the Group, or another involved party is acting as a princ/i.rightpal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others. Judgement is further required in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entit/i.rightes, specif/i.rightcally if market condit/i.rightons have an effect on the variable return exposure of different investors.\n\nThe Group has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes, which may be established by the Group as a sponsor or by a third-party.\n\nInterests in consolidated structured entit/i.rightes: A structured entity is consolidated into the Group's financ/i.rightal statements where the Group controls the structured entity, as per the determinat/i.righton in the accounting policy above.\n\nThe following table presents the Group's interests in consolidated structured entit/i.rightes.\n\n|                                               | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | 2019  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Aircraft and ship leasing                     | 4,388                   | 4,312                   |\n| Princ/i.rightpal and other structured finance | 365                     | 816                     |\n| Total                                         | 4,753                   | 5,128                   |\n\n## Interests in unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes:\n\nUnconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes are all structured entit/i.rightes that are not controlled by the Group. The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes in the normal course of business to facil/i.righttate customer transactions and for specif/i.rightc investment opportunit/i.rightes. An interest in a structured entity is contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variab/i.rightlity of the returns of the Group aris/i.rightng from the performance of the structured entity.\n\nThe table below presents the carrying amount of the assets recognised in the financ/i.rightal statements relating to variable interests held in unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes, the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entit/i.rightes. Maximum exposure to loss is primar/i.rightly lim/i.rightted to the carrying amount of the Group's on-balance sheet exposure to the structured entity. For derivat/i.rightves, the maximum exposure to loss represents the on-balance sheet valuation and not the notional amount. For commitments and guarantees, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.\n\n|                                                                               | 2020                                              | 2020                                 | 2020                                              | 2020                                      | 2020                   | 2019                                              | 2019                                 | 2019                                              | 2019                                      | 2019                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                               | Asset- backed  securit/i.rightes  $mill/i.righton | Structured  finance  $mill/i.righton | Princ/i.rightpal  Finance  funds  $mill/i.righton | Other  activ/i.rightties  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Asset- backed  securit/i.rightes  $mill/i.righton | Structured  finance  $mill/i.righton | Princ/i.rightpal  Finance  funds  $mill/i.righton | Other  activ/i.rightties  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Group's interest -

Structured entit/i.rightes continued\n\nThe main types of activ/i.rightties for which the Group util/i.rightses unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes cover synthetic credit default swaps for managed investment funds (includ/i.rightng special/i.rightsed Princ/i.rightpal Finance funds), portfolio management purposes, structured finance and asset-backed securit/i.rightes. These are detailed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset-backed securit/i.rightes (ABS): The Group also has investments in asset-backed securit/i.rightes issued by third-party sponsored and managed structured entit/i.rightes. For the purpose of market making and at the discret/i.righton of ABS trading desk, the Group may hold an immater/i.rightal amount of debt securit/i.rightes from structured entit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated by credit portfolio management. This is disclosed in the ABS column above\n\nPortfolio management (Group sponsored entit/i.rightes): For the purposes of portfolio management, the Group purchased credit protection via synthetic credit default swaps from note-issu/i.rightng structured entit/i.rightes. This credit protection creates credit risk which the structured entity and subsequently the end investor absorbs. The referenced assets remain on the Group's balance sheet as they are not assigned to these structured entit/i.rightes. The Group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets. The credit protection obtained from the regulatory-compliant securit/i.rightsation only serves to protect the Group against losses upon the occurrence of elig/i.rightble credit events and the underlying assets are not derecognised from the Group's balance sheet. The Group does not hold any equity interests in the structured entit/i.rightes, but may hold an ins/i.rightgnif/i.rightcant amount of the issued notes for market making purposes. This is disclosed in the ABS section above. The proceeds of the notes' issuance are typically held as cash collateral in the issuer's account operated by a trustee or invested in AAArated government-backed securit/i.rightes to collateralise the structured entit/i.rightes swap obligat/i.rightons to the Group, and to repay the princ/i.rightpal to investors at maturity. The structured entit/i.rightes reimburse the Group on actual losses incurred, through the use of the cash collateral or realisat/i.righton of the collateral security. Correspondingly, the structured entit/i.rightes write down the notes issued by an equal amount of the losses incurred, in reverse order of senior/i.rightty. All funding is committed for the life of these vehicles and the Group has no ind/i.rightrect exposure in respect of the vehicles' liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton. The Group has reputational risk in respect of certain portfolio management vehicles and investment funds either because the Group is the arranger and lead manager or because the structured entit/i.rightes have Standard Chartered branding.\n\n- \u00b7 Structured finance: Structured finance comprises interests in transactions that the Group or, more usually, a customer has structured, using one or more structured entit/i.rightes, which provide benefic/i.rightal arrangements for customers. The Group's exposure primar/i.rightly represents the provis/i.righton of funding to these structures as a financ/i.rightal intermed/i.rightary, for which it receives a lender's return. The transactions largely relate to real estate financ/i.rightng and the provis/i.righton of aircraft leasing and ship finance.\n- \u00b7 Princ/i.rightpal Finance Fund: The Group's exposure to Princ/i.rightpal Finance Funds represents committed or invested capital in unleveraged investment funds, primar/i.rightly invest/i.rightng in pan-Asian infrastructure, real estate and private equity.\n- \u00b7 Other activ/i.rightties: Other activ/i.rightties include structured entit/i.rightes created to support margin financ/i.rightng transactions, the refinanc/i.rightng of exist/i.rightng credit and debt facil/i.rightties, as well as setting up of bankruptcy remote structured entit/i.rightes.\n\n## 34.

        "page_content": "## Addit/i.rightonal notes on environment data\n\nThe emiss/i.rightons with/i.rightn our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020. This is to allow suffic/i.rightent time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publicat/i.righton of results. Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financ/i.rightal reporting. This is consistent with internat/i.rightonal carbon-reporting practice.\n\nWe use measured data to calculate our energy and water use from across our properties, which we then scale up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from. For 2020, we sign/i.rightficantly increased the proportion of our property portfolio from which we gathered measured data, which is measured on a square footage basis. For paper and business travel, it is defined per full-time employee.\n\nTotal energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period.\n\nNet internal areas used for water use intens/i.rightty do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas.\n\nWarehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continu/i.rightty purposes, resident/i.rightal properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation.\n\nScope 3 emiss/i.rightons are drawn from reliable data collected from 33 countries, based on seating class and distance flown.\n\nAs we operate largely outside of the UK, all flights domestic or internat/i.rightonal with flight distance of less than 463km, labelled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) as domestic flights, have been classif/i.righted as short haul. All flights with distance flown ranging from 463 to 1,108km, labelled by DBEIS as short haul have been classif/i.righted as medium haul.\n\nWe use an independent third-party assurance provider to verify our greenhouse gas (GHG) emiss/i.rightons. In 2020, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emiss/i.rightons were assured by Global Documentation Ltd, ensuring the accuracy and credib/i.rightlity of our reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our carbon emiss/i.righton criter/i.righta at sc.com/environmentcriter/i.righta\n\nRead our independent assurance report at sc.com/environmentalassurance\n\n## Financ/i.rightal crime prevention\n\n|                                                                                                                          | 2020  %   | 2019  %   | 2018  %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Staff completing External Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk e-learning   (which includes AML, Sanctions, ABC and Fraud Risks)  | 99.9      |           |           |\n| Staff completing  Internal Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk  e-learning  (which includes AML, Sanctions, ABC and Fraud Risks) | 99.9      |           |           |\n| Staff completing Sanctions e-learning                                                                                    | 99.9      | 99.9      | 99.9      |\n| Staff completing  Anti-Money Laundering (AML) e-learning                                                                 |           | 99.9      | 99.9      |\n| Staff completing Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) e-learning                                                            |           | 99.9      | 99.9      |\n\nIn 2020, the Financ/i.rightal Crime Compliance (FCC) e-learning courses have merged into External and Internal Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk courses (with the stand-alone Sanctions course scheduled to drop in 2021); fraud content was newly introduced in both the External and Internal Risks Courses in 2020\n\nComputing method : (Completed + Due)/(Total Population - Untagged) = rate of completion\n\nData excludes Korea which manages its learning on a different system/platform\n\nData is the 'Tagged' population\n\n## Communit/i.rightes: Inclusive communit/i.rightes\n\n## Community expenditure\n\n| Total ($mill/i.righton)                          |   2020 | 2019   |   2018 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash contribut/i.rightons                        |  71.5  | 27. 5  |  22.9  |\n| Employee time (non-cash item)                    |  11.6  | 16.9   |  18.8  |\n| Gifts in kind (non-cash item) 1                  |   1.1  | 0.3    |   0.1  |\n| Management costs                                 |   4.4  | 4.5    |   4.5  |\n| Total (direct investment by the Group)           |  88.6  | 49.2   |  46.3  |\n| Leverage 2                                       |   7.1  | 1.9    |   2.9  |\n| Total (incl. leverage)                           |  95.7  | 51.1   |  49.2  |\n| Percentage of prior year operating profit (PYOP) |   2.58 | 2.01   |   2.04 |\n\n- 1 Gifts in kind comprises all non-monetary donations\n- 2   Leverage data relates to the proceeds from staff and other fundrais/i.rightng activ/i.rightty",

There is no impl/i.rightcation for capital gains tax (no gain or loss) when you donate shares to charity, and UK taxpayers\n\nmay be able to claim income tax relief on the value of their donation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther informat/i.righton can be obtained from the Company's registrars or from ShareGift on 020 7930 3737 or from sharegift.org\n\n## Bankers' Automated Clearing System (BACS)\n\nDiv/i.rightdends can be paid straight into your bank or build/i.rightng society account.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease register online at investorcentre.co.uk or contact our registrar for a mandate form.\n\n## Registrars and shareholder enquir/i.rightes\n\nIf you have any enquir/i.rightes relating to your shareholding and you hold your shares on the UK register, please contact our registrar Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavil/i.rightons, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZZ or call the shareholder helpline number on 0370 702 0138.\n\nIf you hold your shares on the Hong Kong branch register and you have enquir/i.rightes, please contact Computershare Hong Kong Investor Services Lim/i.rightted, 17M Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen's Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can check your shareholding at computershare.com/hk/investors\n\n## Substantial shareholders\n\nThe Company and its shareholders have been granted partial exemption from the disclosure requirements under Part XV of the Securit/i.rightes and Futures Ordinance (SFO). As a result of this exemption, shareholders no longer have an obligat/i.righton under Part XV of the SFO (other than Div/i.rightsions 5, 11 and 12 thereof) to notify the Company of substantial shareholding interests, and the Company is no longer required to mainta/i.rightn a register of interests of substantial shareholders under section 336 of the SFO. The Company is, however, required to file with The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Lim/i.rightted any disclosure of interests made in the UK.\n\n## Taxation\n\nInformation on taxation applying to div/i.rightdends paid to you if you are a shareholder in the UK, Hong Kong or the US will be sent to you with your div/i.rightdend documents. Shareholders and prospective purchasers should consult an appropriate independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of an investment in shares in light of their particular circumstances, includ/i.rightng the effect of any national, state or local laws.\n\n30 April 2021\n\n30 July and\n\n30 October 2021",

These forward-looking statements can be ident/i.rightfied by the fact that they do not relate only to histor/i.rightcal or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as 'may', 'could', 'will', 'expect', 'intend', 'estimate', 'antic/i.rightpate', 'believe', 'plan', 'seek', 'continue' or other words of sim/i.rightlar meaning. By their very nature, such statements are subject to known and unknown risks and\n\nuncertaint/i.rightes and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, and the Group's plans and object/i.rightves, to differ materially from those expressed or impl/i.righted in the forward-looking statements.\n\nRecip/i.rightents should not place reliance on, and are cautioned about relying on, any forward-looking statements. There are several factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or impl/i.righted in forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include (but are not lim/i.rightted to) changes in global, polit/i.rightcal, economic, business, competit/i.rightve, market and regulatory forces or condit/i.rightons, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates, future business combinat/i.rightons or dispos/i.righttions and other factors speci/fi.rightc to the Group. Any forward-looking statement contained in this document is based on past or current trends and/or activ/i.rightties of the Group and should not be taken as a representation that such trends or activ/i.rightties will continue in the future.\n\nNo statement in this document is intended to be a profit forecast or to imply that the earnings of the Group for the current year or future years will necessarily match or exceed the histor/i.rightcal or published earnings of the Group. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. Except as required by any applicable laws or regulations, the Group expressly discla/i.rightms any obligat/i.righton to revise or update any forward-looking statement contained with/i.rightn this document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as a result of new informat/i.righton, future events or otherwise.\n\nNothing in this document shall constitute, in any jur/i.rightsdict/i.righton, an offer or solic/i.righttation to sell or purchase any securit/i.rightes or other financ/i.rightal instruments, nor shall it constitute a recommendation or advice in respect of any securit/i.rightes or other financ/i.rightal instruments or any other matter.",

CCyB as defined in the Basel III standard provides for an addit/i.rightonal capital requirement of up to 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets in a given jur/i.rightsdict/i.righton. The Bank of England's Financ/i.rightal Policy Committee has the power to set the CCyB rate for the United Kingdom. Each bank must calculate its 'inst/i.righttution-specif/i.rightc' CCyB rate, defined as the weighted average of the CCyB rates in effect across the jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons in which it has credit exposures. The inst/i.righttution-specif/i.rightc CCyB rate is then applied to a bank's total risk-weighted assets.",

High-quality liqu/i.rightd assets should be unencumbered, liqu/i.rightd in markets during a time of stress and, ideally, be central bank elig/i.rightble.\n\n## Loan exposure\n\nLoans and advances to customers reported on the balance sheet held at amortised cost or FVOCI, noncancellable credit commitments and cancellable credit commitments for credit cards and overdraft facil/i.rightties.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nThis represents lending made under bilateral agreements with customers entered into in the normal course of business and is based on the legal form of the instrument.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nAmounts loaned to credit inst/i.righttutions includ/i.rightng securit/i.rightes bought under Reverse repo.\n\n## LTV or loan-to-value ratio\n\nA calculation which expresses the amount of a first mortgage lien as a percentage of the total appraised value of real property. The loan-tovalue ratio is used in determin/i.rightng the appropriate level of risk for the loan and therefore the correct price of the loan to the borrower.\n\n## Loans past due\n\nLoans on which payments have been due for up to a maximum of 90 days includ/i.rightng those on which partial payments are being made.\n\n## Loans subject to forbearance impa/i.rightred\n\nLoans where the terms have been renegotiated on terms not consistent with current market levels due to financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculties of the borrower.

        "page_content": "## NPLs or non-performing loans\n\nAn NPL is any loan that is more than 90 days past due or is otherwise ind/i.rightvidually impa/i.rightred. This excludes Retail loans renegotiated at or after 90 days past due, but on which there has been no default in interest or princ/i.rightpal payments for more than 180 days since renegotiat/i.righton, and against which no loss of princ/i.rightpal is expected.\n\n## Non-linear/i.rightty\n\nNon-linear/i.rightty of expected credit loss occurs when the average of expected credit loss for a portfolio is higher than the base case (median) due to the fact that bad economic environment could have a larger impact on ECL calculation than good economic environment.\n\n## Normalised items\n\nSee 'Underlying' on page 307.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nStaff and premises costs, general and admin/i.rightstrative expenses, depreciat/i.righton and amortisat/i.righton. Underlying operating expenses exclude expenses as described in 'Underlying earnings'. A reconcil/i.rightation between underlying and statutory earnings is contained in Note/uni00A02 to the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Operating income or operating profit\n\nNet interest, net fee and net trading income, as well as other operating income. Underlying operating income represents the income line items above, on an underlying basis. See 'Underlying earnings'.\n\n## OTC or Over-the-counter derivat/i.rightves\n\nA bilateral transaction (e.g. derivat/i.rightves) that is not exchange traded and that is valued using valuation models.\n\n## OCA or Own credit adjustment\n\nAn adjustment to the Group's issued debt designated at fair value through profit or loss that reflects the possib/i.rightlity that the Group may default and not pay the full market value of the contracts.\n\n## Perennial sub-optimal clients\n\nClients that have returned below 3% return on risk-weighted assets for the last three years\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThe risk of increased extreme weather events includ/i.rightng flood, drought and sea level rise.\n\n## Pillar 1\n\nThe first pillar of the three pillars of the Basel framework which provides the approach to calculation of the min/i.rightmum capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. Min/i.rightmum capital requirements are 8 per cent of the Group's risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Pillar 2\n\nThe second pillar of the three pillars of the Basel framework which requires banks to undertake a comprehensive assessment of their risks and to determine the appropriate amounts of capital to be held against these risks where other suitable mit/i.rightgants are not available.\n\n## Pillar 3\n\nThe third pillar of the three pillars of the Basel framework which aims to provide a consistent and comprehensive disclosure framework that enhances comparabil/i.rightty between banks and further promotes improvements in risk practices.\n\n## Prior/i.rightty Banking\n\nPrior/i.rightty Banking customers are ind/i.rightviduals who have met certain criter/i.righta for deposits, AUM, mortgage loans or monthly payroll. Criter/i.righta varies by country.\n\n## Private equity investments\n\nEquity securit/i.rightes in operating companies generally not quoted on a public exchange. Investment in private equity often involves the investment of capital in private companies. Capital for private equity investment is raised by retail or inst/i.righttutional investors and used to fund investment strategies such as leveraged buyouts, venture capital, growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital.\n\n## PD or Probabil/i.rightty of default\n\nPD is an internal estimate for each borrower grade of the likel/i.righthood that an obligor will default on an obligat/i.righton over a given time horizon.\n\n## Probabil/i.rightty weighted\n\nObtained by consider/i.rightng the values the metric can assume, weighted by the probabil/i.rightty of each value occurring.\n\n## Profit (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders\n\nProfit (loss) for the year after noncontrolling interests and div/i.rightdends declared in respect of preference shares classif/i.righted as equity.\n\n## PVA or Prudent valuation adjustment\n\nAn adjustment to CET1 capital to reflect the difference between fair value and prudent value posit/i.rightons, where the applicat/i.righton of prudence results in a lower absolute carrying value than recognised in the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## PRA or Prudential Regulation Authority\n\nThe Prudential Regulation Authority is the statutory body responsible for the prudential supervis/i.righton of banks, build/i.rightng societ/i.rightes, credit unions, insurers and a small number of sign/i.rightficant investment firms in the UK. The PRA is a part of the Bank of England.\n\n## Regulatory consolidat/i.righton\n\nThe regulatory consolidat/i.righton of Standard Chartered PLC differs from the statutory consolidat/i.righton in that it excludes Standard Chartered Assurance Lim/i.rightted and Standard Chartered Insurance Lim/i.rightted and includes the full consolidat/i.righton of PT Bank Permata Tbk.\n\n## Repo/reverse repo\n\nA repurchase agreement or repo is a short-term funding agreement, which allows a borrower to sell a financ/i.rightal asset, such as asset-backed securit/i.rightes or government bonds as collateral for cash. As part of the agreement the borrower agrees to repurchase the security at some later date, usually less than 30 days, repaying the proceeds of the loan. For the party on the other end of the transaction (buying the security and agreeing to sell in the future), it is a reverse repurchase agreement or reverse repo.\n\n## Resident/i.rightal mortgage\n\nA loan to purchase a resident/i.rightal property which is then used as collateral to guarantee repayment of the loan. The borrower gives the lender a lien against the property, and the lender can foreclose on the property if the borrower does not repay the loan per the agreed terms. Also known as a home loan.\n\n## RoRWA or Return on risk-weighted assets\n\nProfit before tax for year as a percentage of RWA. Profit may be statutory or underlying and is specif/i.righted where used. See 'RWA' and 'Underlying earnings'.\n\n## RWA or Risk-weighted assets\n\nA measure of a bank's assets adjusted for their associated risks, expressed as a percentage of an exposure value in accordance with the applicable standardised or IRB approach provis/i.rightons.",

        "page_content": "## Risks-not-in-VaR (RNIV)\n\nA framework for ident/i.rightfying and +quantify/i.rightng marginal types of market risk that are not captured in the Value at Risk (VaR) measure for any reason, such as being a far-tail risk or the necessary histor/i.rightcal market data not being available.\n\n## Roll rate\n\nUses a matrix that gives average loan migrat/i.righton rate from delinquency states from period to period. A matrix multipl/i.rightcation is then performed to generate the final PDs by delinquency bucket over different time horizons.\n\n## Secured (fully and partially)\n\nA secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges an asset as collateral for a loan which, in the event that the borrower defaults, the Group is able to take possession of. All secured loans are considered fully secured if the fair value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan at the time of orig/i.rightnation. All other secured loans are considered to be partly secured.\n\n## Securit/i.rightsation\n\nSecurit/i.rightsation is a process by which credit exposures are aggregated into a pool, which is used to back new securit/i.rightes. Under tradit/i.rightonal securit/i.rightsation transactions, assets are sold to a structured entity which then issues new securit/i.rightes to investors at different levels of senior/i.rightty (credit tranching). This allows the credit quality of the assets to be separated from the credit rating of the orig/i.rightnating inst/i.righttution and transfers risk to external investors in a way that meets their risk appetite. Under synthetic securit/i.rightsation transactions, the transfer of risk is achieved by the use of credit derivat/i.rightves or guarantees, and the exposures being securit/i.rightsed remain exposures of the orig/i.rightnating inst/i.righttution.\n\n## Senior debt\n\nDebt that takes prior/i.rightty over other unsecured or otherwise more 'jun/i.rightor' debt owed by the issuer. Senior debt has greater senior/i.rightty in the issuer's capital structure than subordinated debt. In the event the issuer goes bankrupt, senior debt theoretically must be repaid before other creditors receive any payment.\n\n## SICR or Sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk\n\nAssessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at orig/i.rightnation (after consider/i.rightng the passage of time).\n\n## Solo\n\nThe solo regulatory group as defined in the Prudential Regulation Authority waiver letter dated 24 August 2017 differs from Standard Chartered Bank Company in that it includes the full consolidat/i.righton of eight subsid/i.rightaries, namely Standard Chartered Holdings (International) B.V., Standard Chartered MB Holdings B.V, Standard chartered UK Holdings Lim/i.rightted, Standard Chartered Grindlays PTY Lim/i.rightted, SCMB Overseas Lim/i.rightted, Standard Chartered Capital Management (Jersey) LLC, Standard Chartered Debt Trading Lim/i.rightted and Cerulean Investments LP.\n\n## Sovereign exposures\n\nExposures to central governments and central government departments, central banks and entit/i.rightes owned or guaranteed by the aforementioned. Sovereign exposures, as defined by the European Banking Authority, include only exposures to central governments.\n\n## Stage 1\n\nAssets have not experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk since orig/i.rightnation and impa/i.rightrment recognised on the basis of 12 months expected credit losses.\n\n## Stage 2\n\nAssets have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk since orig/i.rightnation and impa/i.rightrment is recognised on the basis of lifet/i.rightme expected credit losses.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nAssets that are in default and considered credit-impa/i.rightred (nonperforming loans).\n\n## Standardised approach\n\nIn relation to credit risk, a method for calculating credit risk capital requirements using External Credit Assessment Institut/i.rightons (ECAI) ratings and supervisory risk weights. In relation to operational risk, a method of calculating the operational capital requirement by the applicat/i.righton of a supervisory defined percentage charge to the gross income of eight specif/i.righted business lines.\n\n## Structured note\n\nAn investment tool which pays a return linked to the value or level of a specif/i.righted asset or index and sometimes offers capital protection if the value declines. Structured notes can be linked to equit/i.rightes, interest rates, funds, commodit/i.rightes and foreign currency.\n\n## Subordinated liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nLiab/i.rightlit/i.rightes which, in the event of insolvency or liqu/i.rightdation of the issuer, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and other creditors of the issuer.\n\n## Tier 1 capital\n\nThe sum of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 capital.\n\n## Tier 1 capital ratio\n\nTier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\nTier 2 capital comprises qualify/i.rightng subordinated liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and related share premium accounts.\n\n## TLAC or Total loss absorbing capacity\n\nAn internat/i.rightonal standard for TLAC issued by the FSB, which requires G-SIBs to have suffic/i.rightent loss-absorbing and recapital/i.rightsation capacity available in resolution, to min/i.rightmise impacts on financ/i.rightal stabil/i.rightty, mainta/i.rightn the continu/i.rightty of crit/i.rightcal functions and avoid exposing public funds to loss.\n\n## Transit/i.righton risks\n\nThe risk of changes to market dynamics or sectoral economics due to governments' response to climate change.\n\n## UK bank levy\n\nA levy that applies to certain UK banks and the UK operations of foreign banks. The levy is payable each year based on a percentage of the chargeable equit/i.rightes and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes on the Group's consolidated balance sheet date. Key exclusions from chargeable equit/i.rightes and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes include Tier 1 capital, insured or guaranteed retail deposits, repos secured on certain sovereign debt and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes subject to netting.",
