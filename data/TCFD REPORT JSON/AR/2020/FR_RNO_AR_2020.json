Thanks to the Formula 1 innovation laboratory, Renault has  developed  its  E-TECH  hybrid  powertrain.  Protected  by  150 patents,  it  has  served  in  the  development  of  two  types  of  hybrid engine:  hybrid  and  plug-in  hybrid,  which  can  be  found  on  the  new CLIO, the new CAPTUR and the new MEGANE Estate. The MEGANE eVision, with its know-how and ingenuity, embodies a breakthrough that is at once  emotional  (design),  innovative  (cabin)  and technological (electric) at the very heart of the Renault range. With it, Renault continues its role as an innovator and creator of cars for living.\n\nIn  2020,  in  addition  to  the  renewal  of  the  MEGANE,  TALISMAN, ESPACE (Europe),  KAPTUR  Phase  2  (Russia),  and  DUSTER  (Brazil), Renault plans to roll out an extensive electrification program for the entire range. This year was marked by the launches of the TWINGO Electric (all-electric technology), the CLIO E-TECH Hybrid (full hybrid technology), the CAPTUR and the MEGANE E-TECH Plug-in Hybrid (plug-in hybrid technology).\n\nIn 2021, Renault will continue to refresh its vehicles in Europe and pursue  its  international  expansion:  in  Latin  America  with  the CAPTUR Phase 2, in Russia, Colombia and Argentina with the New DUSTER, in India with the all-new KIGER SUV, and in Turkey with the  replacement  of  the  SYMBOL,  which  will  go  on  sale  in  spring 2021, under a new name.\n\n## Passenger cars (PC)\n\nIn the small car segment (A and B-segments and similar passenger cars),  Renault  offers  a  wide  range  of  complementary  models:  the KWID,  LOGAN,  SANDERO,  SANDERO  Stepway,  TRIBER,  TWINGO, CLIO, CAPTUR and SYMBOL.\n\nIn  the  A  segment of  small  city  cars,  the  TWINGO  once  again maintained its clear leadership in France (31.4% A segment market share in 2020, +5 pts), putting it well ahead of its competitors, the Fiat  500  (13.1%  segment  share)  and  the  Peugeot  108  (11.6% segment  share).  It  is  thus  taking  full  advantage  of  its  overhaul  in 2019  to  consolidate  its  fourth  ranking  in  Europe,  with  a  growing market share (9.5% segment share in 2020, +2.1 pts).\n\nAfter  selling  nearly  4  million  units  in  25  countries,  the  TWINGO opened a new chapter in its story this year with the launch of the TWINGO  ELECTRIC,  its  all-electric  version.  Renault  has  used  its in-depth  knowledge  of  the  small  city  car  segment  to  develop  an electric car whose handling, range and equipment are tailored to the needs of owners of mini-city cars. Built on a platform that is natively predisposed  to  electric  vehicles,  the  TWINGO  ELECTRIC  offers performance  that  retains  everything  that  has  already  made  the TWINGO a success and further maximizes its appeal. Like its thermal twin,  the  TWINGO  ELECTRIC  has  the  best  turning  radius  on  the market.  With  its  22  kWh  battery,  the  TWINGO  ELECTRIC  can crisscross  the  city  for  an  entire  week  on  a  single  charge.  And  its charging versatility allows it to charge up to four times faster than its competitors on the 22 kilowatt AC terminals frequently found in public  spaces.  The  TWINGO  ELECTRIC  takes  up  TWINGO's  playful design, endearing personality and unique potential for personalization, enriched by a few details that show off its electric identity.",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT\n\nOVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\nOn international  markets,  the  KWID,  launched  in  October  2015  on the  Indian  market,  followed  by  South  Africa,  in  2017  in  Brazil  and Argentina  and  in  2019  along  the  Pacific  coast  in  Mexico  and Colombia, has already sold over 730,000 cars. Its success reflects the unique,  trusted  product  offering  designed  to  be  affordable  for  as many people as possible, as well as the quality of the sales strategy that accompanied the launches: a dealer network that is motivated and fully supported by modern and efficient digital tools. KWID thus confirms its very strong potential for global expansion: positioned in the Top 3 in Latin America in Segment A and with the 2019 launch of the  new  KWID  in  India.  The  KWID  continued  its  dynamic  path  in 2020 in Latin America and India with the introduction of two-tone bodywork.\n\nIn the B segment (station wagon & sedan), the CLIO 5, launched in Europe  in  2019,  extended  its  range  this  year  with  an  electrified offering, the CLIO E-TECH, Groupe Renault's first full hybrid. With its new self-rechargeable hybrid engine, the CLIO E-TECH Hybrid offers unprecedented  driving  pleasure  and  allows  city  driving  in  electric mode up to 80% of the time.\n\nDuring this first full year, the CLIO confirmed its steady growth since 2005 and once again consolidated its first place in Europe, not only in  the  B  Hatch  segment  (market  share  of  11.9%,  +2.2  pts  vs.  the Peugeot 208, No. 2) but also in the entire B segment (market share of  6.5%,  +1.3  pts  vs.  the  Peugeot  208,  No.  2).  In  France,  the  CLIO remained  the  best-selling  vehicle  for  the  eighth  consecutive  year, with 114,102 vehicles sold.\n\nThe CLIO 5 was rolled out internationally throughout 2020. The CLIO continued to grow outside France, in particular in Turkey, where it is the  undisputed  leader  in  its  segment  (market  share  of  50.7%  in 2020).\n\nIn 2020, a total of 340,098 CLIOs were sold worldwide. Sales of the ESTATE variant of the CLIO 4 were maintained in parallel with the CLIO 5 throughout 2020, but this variant will be discontinued from 2021.\n\nIn  the  growing  B-crossover  sub-segment,  the  CAPTUR  2  was launched at the end of 2019: new, fully customizable design and the best  levels  of  technology  and  modularity  in  the  category.  The  new CAPTUR has reinvented itself, while keeping the best of its classic features that have made it such a success throughout the world over the past seven years.\n\nIn the second half of 2020, the new CAPTUR E-TECH Plug-in Hybrid joined the range: it is the first plug-in hybrid vehicle available on a mass-produced  scale, making  this technology accessible to everyone.  Eschewing  compromises,  the  CAPTUR  E-TECH  Plug-in Hybrid offers a driving experience that is fully electric on weekdays and  hybrid  on  weekends  or  for  longer  trips  (65km  range  in all-electric mode in cities and 50km in a combined cycle - WLTP). In addition, at the core of the range, the 1.3 L TCe 140 gasoline engine is  enhanced  by  a  12V  micro-hybridization  system.  Finally,  the E-TECH Hybrid engine (full  hybrid)  will  come  to  the  market  in  the first  half  of  2021.  The  new  CAPTUR  will  thus  propose  a  fully electrified  offer,  for  increasing  versatility  and  controlled  fuel consumption/CO2 emissions.\n\nAlthough  the  competitive  environment  is  still  very  aggressive,  the New CAPTUR managed to retain its leadership in 2020 in its main markets:  in  Europe,  the  CAPTUR  2  continues  to  occupy  first  place (with  a  10.9%  Segment  B  crossover  share  in  2020.  The  vehicle\n\nI\n\nremains  popular  with  our  customers  and  continues  to  contribute significantly to the Brand's image.\n\nFollowing  Russia  in  2016,  the  KAPTUR/CAPTUR  made  its  entry  on the various markets of Latin America and India in 2017. Produced in the  Moscow,  Curitiba  and  Chennai  plants,  the  KAPTUR/CAPTUR,  a C-segment SUV, is well matched with the DUSTER, thanks to its very attractive  design  and  product  characteristics  adapted  to  the requirements of these markets. The KAPTUR/CAPTUR confirmed its strong global expansion potential with over 266,000 sales.\n\nFollowing  the  renewal  of  the  SANDERO,  the  STEPWAY  and  the LOGAN in Latin America in 2019, a major focus has been placed on the performance of retail sales in 2020, in parallel with a net pricing policy.  These  efforts  contributed  to  an  improvement  in  overall profitability,  causing  a  slight  weakening  of  market  share  in  the Region  (-0.5  pt  vs.  2019  for  these  models,  at  1.9%)  in  a  highly competitive environment.\n\nThese  vehicles  maintained  their  positions  on  the  Russian  market, with  market  shares  of  1.7%  for  the  SANDERO  and  2.0%  for  the LOGAN and their STEPWAY versions, stable versus 2019. They will benefit from a refresh this year to include new stylistic elements (fun stickers,  new  upholstery  and  interior  materials),  to  support  the commercial  performance  on  this  key  market,  six  years  after  their launch.\n\n2020 marks the end of the marketing of the SYMBOL in Turkey. It will  be  replaced  by  a  brand-new  model  in  the  second  quarter  of 2021.  The  new  vehicle  aims  to  cover  a  large  part  of  the  compact sedan market and will drive Renault's revival in this segment thanks to a new line, a new name, new equipment and all the stylistic codes of the Renault brand.\n\nIn India, the TRIBER continues to shake up the B segment with its unique positioning. After several months on the market, the TRIBER has  confirmed  its  commercial  success,  with  market  share  of  more than  2%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2019  and  1.4%  in  2020.  Super flexible,  ultra-modular,  benefiting  from  the  tax  advantages  of vehicles under 4.00 meters but offering unrivaled spaciousness, the TRIBER  is  on  the  way  to  becoming  a  blockbuster  in  India.  The TRIBER was launched to great acclaim in South Africa in February 2020  and  in  Indonesia  as  well.  The  arrival  of  the  Easy-R  robotic gearbox in the spring has further expanded the engine/transmission range for this model.\n\nRenault will complete its range in India from the beginning of 2021 with  the  arrival  of  the  KIGER:  a  small,  dynamic  SUV  with  a  racy design built on and with all the advantages of the TRIBER platform, particularly in terms of roominess.\n\nSegment  C represented  36.6%  of  the  global  market  in  2020  and 39.1% in Europe, where Renault was in eleventh place (behind VW, Peugeot, BMW, Ford, Kia, Skoda, Toyota, Mercedes and others) with a 3.9% segment share and more than 181,000 vehicles sold, a drop of 44.4% from 2019, due in large part to the current health crisis.\n\nThe C segment as a whole continues to be by far the world's leading segment in terms of volumes, on a growing trend expected over the coming  years.  Against  this  backdrop,  Renault  is  adapting  its commercial  ranges  to  best  meet  the  expectations  of  customers  in the  segment.  Thus,  each  of  the  three  models  launched  a  new, simpler and more efficient range in 2020.",

In some major markets, it performed well, as it did in France, where the model is in the top sellers with a segment share of 7.8% and more than 20,000 registrations.\n\nThe DUSTER's success is embodied by excellent international sales spanning  all  continents  -  India,  Russia  and  Latin  America  -  with nearly  1.5  million  units  sold  since  its  launch,  putting  it  in  the  top three of the C-SUV segment in Russia and Latin America.\n\nLaunched in Brazil in 2020, the new DUSTER will set out to conquer other  Latin  American  countries  and  Russia  in  2021,  with  a compelling  exterior  and  interior  design    that  has  been  completely overhauled. It now  features striking new  equipment:  new multimedia system with 8-inch screen, hands-free access card, and new  driving  aids:  blind  spot  warning,  multi-view  camera,  downhill speed control (4X4).\n\nWith  this  new  generation,  perceived  quality  improves  without compromising  on  the  attributes  that  have  made  the  DUSTER  so successful:  robustness,  roominess,  reliability,  off-road  capabilities and equipment adapted to the needs of the various markets.\n\nLaunched in  June  of  this  year  in  Russia,  the  KAPTUR  Phase  2  has seen  its  interior  significantly  improved  in  terms  of  finishes,  with better  quality  materials,  as  well  as  in  terms  of  usability.  Its  new equipment - and above all its new 1.3 l turbo engine - have been widely  acclaimed  by  the  press  and  customers.  This  engine  already accounts for more than half of the model's sales. This model will set out to conquer Latin America at the end of next year.\n\nThe ARKANA, launched in September 2019, continues to attract new customers  for  the  Renault  brand  in  Russia  thanks  to  its  unique design in this price range. In 2021, this model will gain traction from the  release  of  a  new  limited  series  and  continuous  improvement, particularly around perceived quality.\n\nThe C-HATCH sub-segment fell  14.3%  worldwide in 2020, while in Europe it decreased by 24.3%. The C-ESTATE sub-segment also fell, by 17.6% worldwide and by 20% in Europe.\n\nIn  2020,  the  HATCH+ESTATE sub-segment accounted for 42.9% of the  C-segment,  in  which  the  MEGANE  is  in  eleventh  place  with  a segment share of 3.6% (-1.25 pts vs. 2019) and 71,968 vehicles sold in Europe (PC).\n\nIn 2020, the MEGANE HATCH fell in France but remained in second place  (20,640  vehicles  sold  excluding  company),  with  a  14.0% segment share (-2.43 pts vs. 2019). The MEGANE is also among the Top 6 in Spain, with a 6.4% segment share (-0.78 pts vs. 2019); The MEGANE is in the Top 4 in Portugal, 13.3% segment share, -4.31 pts vs. 2019), and second in France with a 20% segment share (-1.97 pts vs. 2019).\n\nOVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\nThe MEGANE SEDAN had a very good year in Turkey, ranking second in  its  segment  with  more  than  40,000  units  sold  during  the  year (+73.6% vs. 2019) bringing its segment share to 15.4% (+1.76 pts vs. 2019).\n\nWith  130,096  units  sold  (PC+LCV),  including  71,968  in  Europe  (PC) and 62,309 including LCV, the MEGANE, in its three versions, is the largest sales volume in the Segment C for Renault. The model is very popular  with  its  buyers  for  its  design,  level  of  equipment  and comfort.  Moreover,  the  design  continues  to  be  the  first  reason  for choosing the model, in a segment where the first reason for buying is usually brand loyalty.\n\nThe New MEGANE was launched in spring 2020, and continues to be popular thanks to an even more attractive design and new on-board technologies.  Its  increasingly  advanced  range  of  engines  meets customer  expectations  in  terms  of  comfort  and  the  environment. The  New  MEGANE  ESTATE  presents  the  first  plug-in  hybrid powertrain  (E-TECH)  in  the  history  of  the  MEGANE  and  Renault's C-segment, pending its next unveiling in the Sedan version in 2021.\n\nThe C-MPV sub-segment was down 46% to represent only 5.5% of Segment C in Europe in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the SCENIC held up well, attracting 37,048 customers on the continent, with a 14.5% segment share (-2 pts vs. 2019). This year, it occupied third place in the European C-MPV market, and was leader in France and Belgium. In France, the SCENIC (17,845 vehicles sold) represents  a  segment  share  of  38.5%  (-2.94  pts  vs.  2019).  In Belgium, the SCENIC (4,376 vehicles sold) achieved a segment share of 32.5%  (-3.56  pts  vs. 2019). To continue increasing its attractiveness,  in  2020,  the  SCENIC  benefitted  from  a  fresh  design and  updated  engines  that  are  increasingly  efficient  and  compliant with current European standards.\n\nThe  KANGOO,  which  has  been  made  in  Maubeuge  (France)  for  13 years,  is  in  its  last  year  of  production  for  Europe  in  2020.  It  thus finishes in seventh place in the Combispace segment in Europe, with a  range  limited  exclusively  to  BVM  diesel  engines.  The  new generation KANGOO was unveiled in picture in November 2020, with its  elegant  and  athletic  design  sparking  enthusiasm.  The  first deliveries  are  slated  for  the  spring  of  2021.  For  some  countries outside  Europe,  the  New  KANGOO  will  be  supported  by  the  New EXPRESS made in Tangiers (Morocco).\n\nWith  its  full  range  of  high-end  vehicles,  Renault  now  covers  all segments in the category:  MPV with the ESPACE, sedans with the TALISMAN, also available in a station wagon version for Europe, and an  SUV  with  the  KOLEOS.  These  three  models  also  ensure  wide geographic coverage, accounting for approximately 65% of sales in Korea (SM6 and QM6) and China (KOLEOS).\n\nThe new Renault ESPACE launched in June 2020 adds new features to better meet the needs of high-end customers thanks to:\n\n- its  design:  the  new  Renault  ESPACE  maintains  its  crossover P silhouette  and  reinforces  the  conventions  of  SUVs  (new,  more assertive  front  bumper,  new  20''  wheel  trims,  new  rear  ski).  For the first time in the Renault range, the new Renault ESPACE has integrated  MATRIX  Vision  LED  adaptive  lights  that  combine design  and  technology.  Inside,  the  new  Renault  ESPACE  adopts the  new  design  interpretation  of  the  high-end  brand  INITIALE Paris. This version accounts for 65% of the versions sold;\n\nI",

Powerful,  quiet,  flexible  and  fuel-efficient,  this  engine emits only 153g of CO2/km, making it the best in its class.\n\nIts  top-of-the-range  equipment  has  been  enriched  over  the  years, notably  in  terms  of  ADAS  features,  with  Adaptive  Cruise  Control, pedestrian  and  cyclist  AEBS  and  Easy  Park  Assist,  while  its  4x4 version now includes hill descent control.\n\nRenault  also  stands  out  in  passenger  transport  with  the  complete renewal of its TRAFIC range in early 2021: the New TRAFIC Combi and New Renault SPACECLASS make it possible to transport up to nine  people  in  exceptional  comfort  and  performance  conditions: volume  and  modularity,  without  compromising  on  comfort  or  the number of seats available.\n\nThe  exterior  design  has  been  modernized,  with  a  more  expressive and dynamic front end, and the cabin has been revisited to make it even more practical and elegant, notably with a new dashboard.\n\nThe new passenger transport range also benefits from latest-generation driving aids for enhanced safety and the Renault EASY LINK multimedia system.\n\nThe  upmarket  versions  of  the  SpaceClass  -  for  transporting  VIP customers  -  provide  a  veritable  mobile  lounge  for  an  improved on-board experience, with features including up to six seats facing each  other  (best  knee  radius  on  the  market),  individual  sliding, swivel and removable seats and a sliding table.\n\nThe  New  TRAFIC  Combi  and  New  Renault  SpaceClass  offer  an expanded and renewed range of efficient  engines  that  meet  FULL Euro  6d  standards  with  a  2.0 l  diesel  engine  boasting  from  110  to 170hp and an EDC6 automatic transmission available from 150hp.\n\nSold in over 40 countries, the Renault TRAFIC PC accounts for nearly 15.2% of TRAFIC sales worldwide, with 11,999 sales in 2020.\n\n## Light commercial vehicles (LCVs)\n\nGroupe Renault is continuing to develop light commercial vehicles, not  only  under  the  Renault  brand  but  also  through  manufacturing partnerships with Nissan, Renault Trucks, and Daimler since 2016.",

This  specialized  network  currently  comprises  626  points  of sale that meet standards tailored to business customers' expectations,  demonstrating  its  efficiency  year  after  year.  It celebrated its tenth birthday in 2019.\n\nGroupe  Renault's  commercial  performance  in  2020  was  hampered by  the  complex  economic  context  of  COVID-19.  With  520,640  LCV sales (including JINBEI), or 5.48% of global market share (excluding North  America),  the  drive  for  international  sales  continued  and accounted  for  47.8%  of  global  LCV  sales,  compared  with  42.3%  in 2019.\n\nIn non-pick-up markets in Europe, the Renault brand ranked in the Top 2 with 14.6% of the LCV market.

Renault is the European leader  in  LCV  EV  sales,  with  a  37.1%  market  share  thanks  to  the KANGOO Z.E., the best-seller with almost 10,000 sales and the ZOE LCV.\n\nIn  the  small  van  segment  (weight  <2  metric  tons),  the  KANGOO remains  an  essential  benchmark  in  the  market.  The  KANGOO  and KANGOO Z.E. remain firmly entrenched in the Top 3 in Europe, with 14%  of  the  small  van  segment.  The  KANGOO  Z.E.  -  the  electric model - took 29.2% of the electric LCV market, with nearly 10,000 vehicles sold over the year. More than 55,000 KANGOO Z.E. cars are on the road in Europe, making it a major contributor to sustainable mobility in the field of professional activities.\n\nThe  combined  PC+LCV  KANGOO,  now  on  the  market  for  13  years, has racked up more than 1.5 million sales worldwide. It will continue its  life  a  little  in  2021,  but  will  soon  be  supported  by  a  new generation  of  two  models:  the  New  EXPRESS  van  and  the  New KANGOO  van,  which  were  unveiled  in  picture  in  November  2020, with the first deliveries due in the spring of 2021. The new KANGOO van  offers  some  very  appealing  innovations  that  will  once  again revolutionize the market and the way user companies work.\n\nIn  Latin  America,  the  new  generation  of  KANGOO  vans,  made  in Cordoba (Argentina) and launched in mid-2018, is suffering from the very  unfavorable  economic  environment  in  Argentina,  but  is extending its marketing reach into countries like Mexico pending its entry into the Brazilian market with flex-fuel engines. The KANGOO thus ranked third in Latin America in 2020.\n\nIn  the  van  segment  (between  2  and  6.5  metric  tons),  Renault  is continuing  its  offensive  with  a  brand  New  TRAFIC  and  MASTER range that has been available since September 2019 and which sold 141,072 units in 2020.\n\nThe  TRAFIC  is  a  versatile  van  with  a  refined  interior  design  and expressive exterior (full LED headlights and light signature) and new\n\nOVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\n2.0 l engines with up to 170hp and 380Nm and an EDC6 automatic transmission.\n\nMore  comfortable,  and  designed  to  be  used  as  a  mobile  office  by professionals,  the  TRAFIC  has  record  dimensions  for  usable  length (4.15m),  with  volume  ranging  from  5.2  to  8.6m 3 .  The  TRAFIC  is available  in  275  versions  from  vans  to  flatbeds  to  crew  cabs  or numerous layout variations for panelwork and windows, lengths or heights.\n\nThe Renault TRAFIC recorded annual sales of 63,221 in the Compact LCV  segment  in  Europe  (with  a  segment  share  of  14%).  It  is manufactured at the Sandouville plant in France.\n\nIn the Large Van segment, the Renault MASTER offers a new, larger and  more  robust  front  end,  a  completely  redesigned  interior,  new ADAS  (Advanced  Driver-Assistance  Systems)  and  new,  more powerful and quieter engines. It makes drivers' lives easier with new innovative  equipment  (extractable  dashboard  tablet,  drawer-style glove  box,  induction  smartphone  charger,  and  for  the  first  time  in the segment, 'rear view assist', a rear view monitoring assistant).\n\nThe Renault MASTER offers 'made-to-measure' features, with over 350 versions, four lengths, three heights, vans, combis, platform and chassis  cab,  front  and  rear-wheel  drive, etc .,  offering  a  working volume of between 8 and 22m 3 .\n\nIn terms of engines, the Renault MASTER has a new range of 2.3 l dCi engines even better suited for professional uses. These engines now meet Euro 6d-temp/Euro VI (depending on the version) standards and all  of  them have Twin Turbo technology. They have increased power of  up  to  180hp  and  increased  torque  of  up  to  400Nm  for  a  more dynamic  and  responsive  driving  experience  while  keeping  fuel consumption low.\n\nThe Renault MASTER is manufactured at the Batilly plant (France) and Curitiba plant (Brazil). It is sold in nearly 50 countries. In Europe, the share of the LCV Large Vans segment stood at 14% (including sales  of  Renault  Trucks),  thus  allowing  the  Renault  MASTER  to consolidate fourth place on the podium. Internationally, in 2020 the Renault MASTER positioned itself as a leader on strategic markets, including Brazil (42.8% segment share) and Morocco (31.5% market share).  The  MASTER  maintains  its  position  on  the  podium  in Australia (14.4%) and Argentina (17.2%).\n\nThe Pick-up market represents a potential for Renault to win new customers. The Renault ALASKAN and the Renault OROCH form the backbone of this market offensive.\n\nIn America, the Renault ALASKAN has taken a new step forward. In November 2020,  the  Renault  Santa-Isabel  plant  in  Cordoba  began manufacturing  the  Renault  ALASKAN  for  the  Argentinian  market. This  launch  rounds  out  the  ALASKAN's  footprint  in  the  Americas with an entry into Colombia, where it recorded a segment share of 5.7% in 2020.\n\nIn Europe,  the  ALASKAN  has  suffered  from  a  complicated commercial  and  industrial  environment,  with  the  transition  to  the E6dTemp range, the impact of COVID-19 and the consequences of Nissan's announced withdrawal from the Barcelona plant at the end of  2021.  Despite  this  backdrop,  a  limited  'Ice  Edition'  will  be marketed in January 2021 to highlight one of the model's strengths: its highly expressive design.",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT\n\nOVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\nSales  of  the  OROCH  were  constrained  by  production  capacities  in 2020, despite the downturn in markets linked to COVID-19 and its economic  fallout.  However,  the  OROCH  remained  at  the  top  of  its segment or took second or third place in most countries (ranked first in Colombia, second in Argentina and Mexico). The Renault OROCH is sold in many regions, including Africa and Asia-Pacific.\n\n## Groupe Renault's electric range: pioneer and leader in the electric market, Groupe Renault is expanding its product offensive\n\nIn  2020,  the  European  electric  vehicle  market  enjoyed  the  fastest growth in the world, with volumes doubling versus 2019, and a new record was set with more than 755,900 electric vehicles sold. Growth in the market for fully electric vehicles is accelerating, with more and more competitors entering the market in all segments.\n\nGermany has become the leading electric vehicle market in terms of volumes,  with  197,400  units  sold  and  market  share  of  6.2%  in electric vehicles. Norway remains Europe's leading vehicle market in terms of share of a market in which: two out of every five vehicles sold  are  electric.  France  is  the  second-biggest  country  in  terms  of volumes,  with  119,700  units  and  electric  vehicles  accounting  for 5.8% of the overall market.\n\nRenault  maintains  its  leadership  in  Europe  thanks  to  the  ZOE's record sales performance, with 100,815 sales in 2020 for this scope. The Renault ZOE was also the best-selling electric model in Europe in  2020.  Groupe  Renault's  biggest  markets  are  France,  Germany, Italy,  the  United  Kingdom  and  Spain.  The  range  expands  with  the launch of the TWINGO Electric.\n\nIn the electric light commercial vehicle segment:\n\n- for  the  tenth  consecutive  year,  the  KANGOO  Z.E.  remains  by  far P the leader in Europe, with electric segment share of 29.2%. At the end  of  2020,  cumulative  sales  of  the  KANGOO  Z.E.  in  Europe totaled  more  than  55,000  units.  In  2021,  the  New  KANGOO  van will  take  over  with  its  Z.E.  versions,  bringing  improvements  and innovations that should continue to convince companies to switch to sustainable mobility for their transport and service activities;\n- with  the  MASTER  Z.E.,  Renault  now  offers  the  widest  variety  of P versions  of  large  electric  vans,  with  a  new  chassis-cab  version recently and a payload of up to 1,700 kg.\n\nThe new range offers:\n\n- the choice between three types of bodies (van, floor-cab, chassis P cab);\n- a  gross  vehicle  weight  rating  (GVWR)  of  3.1  or  3.5  metric  tons, P allowing a payload of up to 1,700 kg (before transformation);\n- from 8m 3 to 23m 3 of useful volume. P\n\nThe  new  offer  has  been  made  possible  in  particular  thanks  to developments in the electric motor gearbox. The entire MASTER Z.E. range offers an WLTP range of 130 km and a full charge in six hours with the WallBox 32A/7.4 kW.\n\nSince  it  launched  its  electric  program,  Renault  has  sold  more  than 370,000  electric  vehicles  in  Europe  and  more  than  397,000 worldwide:  284,800  ZOE,  59,150  KANGOO  Z.E.,  11,400  FLUENCE Z.E./SM3  Z.E.,  4,600  K-Z.E.,  31,100  TWIZY,  770  MASTER  Z.E.  and 5,100 TWINGO Electric in 2020.\n\nI\n\nThe  Group  has  reached  technical  and  commercial  maturity  in  this segment thanks to its experience dating back more than 10 years. This offers a competitive advantage over other carmakers. In 2020, Groupe  Renault  announced  several  new  products:  launch  of  the TWINGO  ELECTRIC  to  round  out  the  range  for  urban  use  and presentation of the DACIA SPRING, which promises to be the most affordable  offer  on  the  market  to  open  up  electric  mobility  for  all. Through  the  MEGANE  eVISION  show  car,  the  Group  is  also announcing the arrival of an offer in the C segment.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  use  of  electric  vehicles,  Renault  continues  to develop  innovative  connected  services.  The  MyRenault  app  brings together all the connected services linked to the electric vehicle so as  to  support  the  customer's  day-to-day  experience.  This  app  also ushers in new services such as a trip planner factoring in charging needs  and  time,  and  the  real-time  availability  of  nearby  charging stations.\n\nRenault is also committed to ecosystem development that promotes - and is encouraged by - the widespread roll-out of electric mobility. For example, the Group has set up solutions with its partners that allow  used  batteries  to  be  reused  for  different  applications: stationary  energy  storage,  which  allows  better  integration  of renewable  energies  in  the  energy  mix,  or  even  maritime  use  by electrifying boats going up and down the Seine. The transformation of the Flins plant into a center of excellence in the circular economy is  another  example  of  Groupe  Renault's  determination  to  promote the development of sustainable mobility.\n\n## The Dacia brand: a focus on the basics\n\nA Groupe Renault brand since 1998, Dacia was founded in Romania in  1968 to manufacture Renault models under license for the local market.  Revived  with  the  LOGAN  in  2004,  the  Dacia  brand  is  now present  in  44  countries,  mainly  in  Europe  and  the  Mediterranean region.\n\nThe  first  Dacia  vehicle  sold  outside  Romania,  the  LOGAN  was  the result  of  close  collaboration  between  the  Romanian  engineering teams  and  those  based  at  the  Renault  Technocentre.  From  the outset,  the  program  broke  with  automotive  industry  practice  by rethinking  the  entire  production  chain  based  on  cost  constraints. This  equation  has  made  -  and  continues  to  make  -  the  brand  a success.\n\nWith the launch of the SANDERO and then the DUSTER, Dacia has confirmed its boldness and ability to shake up the codes by offering spacious, practical and robust new cars at the best value for money in  the  market.  Drawing on proven and amortized technologies, the vehicles' equipment and features are kept to a strict minimum, and are easy  to  use  and  maintain.  Dacia's  commercial  offering (equipment, price policy) makes the purchase as simple as possible.\n\nA large proportion of Dacia customers come from the used vehicle market and are accessing a new vehicle for the first time. However, Dacia is also attracting a new type of consumer who is choosing to consume  in  a  different,  more  thoughtful  way.  This  behavior expresses  itself  as  a  lesser  degree  of  interest  in  the  race  for technological  innovation  and  a  focus  on  only  the  best  of  what automobiles  have  to  offer:  the  freedom  to  move.  In  fact,  the positioning  of  the  Dacia  brand  is  based  on  the  idea  of  serving  the basic needs of all these pragmatic customers, who want to pay a fair price for what they need, without foregoing any modern features.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nOver  the  past  15  years,  Dacia  has  enjoyed  growing  success,  with more  than  7  million  customers,  many  of  them  Dacia  enthusiasts, meeting  at  community  events  in  many  countries  and  exchanging views on social networks about the use of their cars.\n\n## 2020, the start of a new chapter\n\nThe  COVID-19  health  crisis  has  had  a  considerable  impact  on  the sale  of  vehicles,  particularly  to  private  individuals,  the  preferred channel  for  the  Dacia  brand.  Nearly  521,000  vehicles  were  sold during the year, a 29% decline on the record set in 2019. Despite the bleak  backdrop,  Dacia  now  boasts  all-time  high  levels  of  market share in Spain and Hungary, and remains the undisputed leader in Romania and Morocco.\n\nIn Europe, the SANDERO was the best-selling vehicle for individual customers  for  the  fourth  year  in  a  row.  The  ECO-G,  bi-fuel gasoline-LPG  powertrain  offered  on  the  majority  of  the  range achieved a significant breakthrough: more than one in two cars with engines running on LPG sold in Europe was a Dacia.\n\n2020 was the year of the launch of the new generation of the iconic LOGAN  and  the  no  less  emblematic  SANDERO  and  SANDERO Stepway. This launch has allowed Dacia to refresh its offering in the city and multi-purpose compact segments to meet all the needs of individuals. The new SANDERO, SANDERO Stepway and LOGAN are revitalized incarnations of the spirit of their elders. For a price that is still as low as ever, they provide access to a new model at the best value for money on the market. Retaining their external dimensions, they offer more  modernity,  volume  and  versatility  without repudiating  their  fundamentals  of  simplicity  and  reliability.  They change platforms and offer a higher level of equipment, active and passive safety, new engines including a dual gasoline/LPG format, a new automatic gearbox and a new six-speed manual gearbox.\n\nThe  SANDERO  has  become  the  best-seller  of  the  range  since  its launch. With nearly 2.2 million units sold, it accounted for 41% of the brand's  sales  in  2020.  Its  Stepway  version  represents  68%  of  the SANDERO family sales mix.\n\nThe LOGAN is Dacia's flagship model and the brand's legacy family sedan. In 2005, it revolutionized the automotive market by making new cars accessible to a wider public. Fifteen years later, still true to its original values, the new generation offers increased comfort and record-breaking  roominess.  A  key  model  for  sedan  markets  like Romania  and  Morocco,  the  New  LOGAN  represents  27%  of cumulative  Dacia  brand  sales  and  will  continue  to  appeal  to customers looking for spacious cars.\n\nThree years after the launch of the new generation model, DUSTER's success story continues as it retains its ranking among the SUVs with the  highest  sales  in  the  individual  market  in  Europe.  Its  still  very attractive  price,  well  thought-out  features  such  as  the  multi-view camera  system  and  hands-free  card,  combined  with  its  4x4 capacities, continue to attract more and more customers.\n\nThe  DOKKER,  the  practical,  versatile  5-seater  Combispace,  and DOKKER Van, its  LCV  version,  had  an  excellent  year  in  2020,  with 71,000 sales, mainly in the Combispace segment in Europe, ranking\n\nOVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\nin fourth place with 14.1% of segment share. Since their launch the DOKKER  and  the  DOKKER  Van  have  exceeded  630,000  sales.  In 2021, the DOKKER Van will give way to a 100% Renault Van offer with the New EXPRESS Van and the New KANGOO Van.\n\n2020 was also the year of a new chapter in Dacia's history with the unveiling of its first fully electric model. The brand's entry into the electric  city  car  market  was  heralded  in  March  2020  with  the presentation  of  the  Dacia  SPRING  Electric  show  car.  The  SPRING Electric is a revolution: positioned as the cheapest electric city car in the market, it makes electric mobility even more accessible. Behind its  disruptive  SUV  look,  it  boasts  record-breaking  roominess,  a simple  and  reliable  electric  engine  and  a  reassuring  range.  Robust and  well-equipped,  the  SPRING  Electric  will  address  both  retail customers and new areas of electric mobility such as car sharing and last-mile delivery.\n\n## Renault Samsung Motors\n\nFounded  in  2000,  the  Renault  Samsung  Motors  (RSM)  brand  is marketed  exclusively  in  South  Korea,  with  a  range  of  five  sedans (including one 100% electric model) and two SUVs.\n\nParticularly renowned for its quality of service, in 2020, RSM ranked as the leader in customer satisfaction for the nineteenth consecutive year in sales, and for the fifth consecutive year in after-sales.\n\nThe brand's volumes amounted to 90,300 units in 2020, an increase of 14% compared with 2019, with market share of 5.5%.\n\nIn sedans, the SM3 covers the C segment and is only available in an electric version (SM3 Z.E.) (857 units sold, an increase of 8%).\n\nThe SM6 sedan is closely derived from the Renault TALISMAN. Both vehicles  were  developed  at  the  same  time  by  the  two  engineering centers  Renault  Technologies  Korea  in  Seoul  and  the  Renault Technocentre  in  France.  First  marketed  in  March  2016,  the  SM6's immediate  success  continued  into  2017  and  2018.  The  New  SM6, launched  last  July,  sold  8,527  vehicles  in  2020,  giving  it  a  4.4% segment share (third place), just behind the local brands, thanks in particular to the arrival of two new turbo gasoline engines (powerful yet frugal TCe160 EDC and TCe225 EDC).\n\nFor  SUVs,  the  range  includes  the  QM6,  launched  on  September  1, 2016.  Sold  under  the  Renault  Samsung  Motors  brand,  the  QM6  is positioned in the D-SUV segment. In 2020, 46,825 units were sold, only a slight decline of 1.7% compared with 2019, despite the crisis. The  QM6  thus  maintained  its  third  ranking  in  its  category,  with  a 19.4% segment share in a market dominated by local players.\n\nIn  2020, Renault Samsung Motors introduced the XM3 SUV Coup\u00e9, based  on  the  2019  XM3  Inspire  show  car.  RSM  is  the  first mass-market carmaker to launch this type of concept on the South Korean market. The XM3 is the Korea-specific version of the Renault ARKANA SUV Coup\u00e9, already on sale in Russia. The XM3's launch is part of Groupe Renault's international strategy. Manufactured at the Busan plant south of Seoul, the XM3 conquered the South Korean market from its launch, with 34,091 units sold in 2020 and an 18% segment share (No. 3 behind local brands).",

Illustrating the synergies of the Alliance, this plant also produces the ROGUE model for Nissan, which is exported to North America, with a total of 253,924 units sold in 2020 (this model shares the RSM QM6 and Renault KOLEOS platform).\n\n## Alpine: an enriched A110 range and competition built into its wiring\n\nThe  Alpine  is  the  Groupe  Renault  brand  dedicated  to  innovative, authentic  and  exclusive  sports  cars.  2020  was  a  pivotal  year  for  it, with  the  announcement  of  its  arrival  in  Formula  1  in  2021  and  its move  up  to  LMP1,  the  premier  category  of  the  World  Endurance Championship  (WEC).  On  the  product  side,  Alpine  is  enriching  its A110 offer - a multi-award-winning model whose range consists of the A110 Pure, the A110 Legend, the A110S - with the launch of two limited series: the A110 Color Edition 2020 and the A110 Legend GT. In 2020 the brand logged a total of 1,525 registrations.\n\nThe A110 Color Edition 2020 is not only a limited-edition version, but also  a  new  annual  program.  Mirroring  the  world  of  fashion  and  its seasonal  collections,  the  A110  Color  Edition  will  be  renewed  every year.  In  2020,  the  A110  Color  Edition  took  its  inspiration  from  the intense  and  vibrant  A110S.  It  offers  an  exclusive  Sunflower  Yellow finish and was available for sale until the end of 2020. That hue was then removed from the color palette.\n\nWith  only  400  units  produced  worldwide  -  all  in  2020  -  the  A110 Legend  GT  is based on the current A110  Legend.  With custom-designed design interior and bodywork features, it enhances the elegance of the A110 Legend. This reinterpretation gave birth to the most sophisticated version of the A110 to date, giving the brand real prominence - especially among the most discerning sports car buyers.\n\n2020 also marked the beginning of its customization offer with the Atelier Alpine, which includes 29 new colors, each limited to 110 cars worldwide,  four  new  caliper  colors,  three  new  wheel  finishes  and thousands of possible combinations to make each A110 as unique as its owner.\n\nWith  competition  built  into  its  wiring,  Alpine  completed  its  third single-brand  championship  this  year,  the  Alpine  Elf  Europa  Cup. Developed  with  its  competition  partner  Signatech,  it  is  making  an appearance on some of the most beautiful circuits in Europe. For the most experienced drivers, Alpine offers the A110 GT4, a competition version  also  developed  by  Signatech.  In  2020,  the  A110  Rallye successfully  took  part  in  its  first  races  in  France.  In  September,  it received  FIA  R-GT  approval,  thereby  becoming  eligible  for  all international events.\n\nI\n\n## Lada: complete transformation of the range continues\n\nAn  iconic  leader  in  the  Russian  market  for  over  50  years,  LADA  is Groupe Renault's fifth brand.\n\nLADA  vehicles  are  designed,  produced  and  sold  by  AVTOVAZ, Russia's  leading  carmaker  and  a  partner  of  Groupe  Renault  since 2008,  which  also  manufactures  cars  for  the  Renault-NissanMitsubishi Alliance for the Russian market and CIS countries.\n\nWith  the  launch  of  the  LADA  Vesta  in  2015,  thanks  to  the  LADA XRAY a new era began for the LADA brand, with major ambitions: a fully renewed range of vehicles and services, accessible and adapted to  local  markets,  attractive  new  design  concepts  and  a  rapidly changing network. In 2019, with the renewal of the legendary 4X4, LADA  marked  a  new  step  in  the  enrichment  of  the  brand  and confirmed  its  leadership  as  an  unbeatable  all-terrain  vehicle manufacturer.\n\nIn 2020, LADA confirmed its dynamism, not only with exciting new developments  on  renowned  and  popular  models,  but  also  with  a continuous transformation of the dealer network in Russia reflected in a clear improvement on quality and customer service. LADA is in line  to  maintain  its  leadership  in  the  Russian  market  and  expand abroad.\n\nThanks to the success of its renewed line up and efforts to develop new  market  opportunities  and  brand  sustainability,  and  in  the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, LADA sales worldwide fell by 5% to 394,000 cars (including the NIVA): of this total, 354,000 were sold in the Russian market and 41,000 internationally.\n\nThe LADA brand is leader in the Russian automotive market with a market share of  21.5%,  an  improvement  of  0.9  point  compared  to 2019 and giving it the highest market share since 2011.\n\nThis sustainable growth in recent years is driven by the success of its models in a very competitive environment, with three LADA vehicles among the Top 10 most sold passenger cars in Russia, including the LADA Granta  at  No.  1  (for  the  2  second  year  in  a  row),  the  LADA Vesta at No. 2 (also for the 2 second year in a row) and the LADA Largus VP at No. 7.\n\nIn a very  challenging  environment,  LADA  has  preserved  its leadership in Belarus (LADA Vesta No. 1) and Azerbaijan, and ranks in the Top 3 in all CIS countries. Sales volumes increased by 12% in Kazakhstan,  where  Granta  ranks  No.  1  in  terms  of  sales.  LADA confirmed  its  position  as  the  No.  1  imported  brand  in  Uzbekistan, with  an  extensive  and  refreshed  dealer  network  of  16  centers. Growth was also recorded in Central Asia and the Caucasus, led by Tajikistan (+30%), Kyrgyzstan (+110%) and Armenia (+45%), thanks to  the  opening  of  new  concessions,  fleet  contracts  and  the appointment of new importers.\n\nAVTOVAZ also produced more than 74,000 vehicles for the Alliance, including  popular  models  such  as:  the  Renault  LOGAN,  LOGAN Stepway, SANDERO and SANDERO Stepway.",

A dedicated department oversees this B-to-B Powertrain activity,  both  in  respect  of  exchanges  of  powertrain  parts  with partners,  and  for  related  engineering  activities.  The  aim  of  these synergies  is  to  pool  development  costs,  absorb  fixed  production costs, and generate economies of scale in the industrial activities of Renault and its suppliers in order to optimize Groupe Renault's free cash flow. In addition to the Alliance with Nissan and MMC, which share  a  common  range  of  products,  an  industrial  system  and  a supplier network, this activity seeks to promote and offer Renault's powertrain  units  in  the  context  of  automotive  cooperations  or third-party  sales.  These  operations  enable  our  partners  to  benefit from Renault technology and give Renault access, where useful, to its partners' developments and manufacturing capacity. This activity also serves to identify and set up one-off cooperation projects and to evaluate our competitiveness and level of quality compared to our competition.\n\n## Advantages\n\nA modern,  CO2-efficient  powertrain  range:  with  its  internal combustion,  hybrid  and  electric  range,  Renault  has  once  again demonstrated  its  commitment  to  reducing  the  environmental footprint of vehicles throughout their life cycle. The qualities of the Renault  powertrain  range  have  convinced  our  partners  of  the advantages of using our engines for their vehicles.\n\nNissan, Renault's partner in the Alliance, has thus relied on the latest generations of Renault engines to reduce average CO2 emissions in its range of passenger cars in Europe. Groupe Renault is one of the most efficient manufacturers in Europe in terms of consumption and approved  CO2  emissions  (for  more  details,  see  chapter  2.2.3.A, Vehicle use section).\n\n## The organization\n\nIn Renault's Strategy, Business Development  and  Business Management  department,  dedicated  teams  work  to  detect opportunities, prepare bids, and negotiate contracts. Sensitive to the expectations of carmaker customers, these teams allow for optimal responsiveness by interfacing with all Renault Engineering departments.\n\nOVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\n## Main manufacturing sites 1.1.3.4 production figures\n\nTo meet the demands of its customers, Groupe Renault relies on an industrial  footprint  consisting  of  38  industrial  sites  located  around the  world  as  close  as  possible  to  the  markets  in  which  it  sells  its brands' vehicles.\n\nAll these sites operate under common principles:\n\n- making employee a priority; P\n- a desire to satisfy our customers; P\n- constantly working to improve the competitiveness of our sites, in P particular  through  convergence  toward  our  industry  4.0  vision. (see section 2.2.3 \"Plants that are transforming\").\n\nOur  production  capacity  utilization  rate  in  2020  is  88%  worldwide and 68% in France (using the Harbour method on the basis of two shifts, calculated on the standard of 3,760 hours per year).\n\nThe Alliance and Renault's strategic partnerships offer opportunities for  synergies  based  on  the  pooling  of  production  resources  and enable us to increase the industrial activity of our sites. Therefore:\n\n- Renault-Nissan vehicles are produced by AVTOVAZ in Russia; P\n- Flins,  Batilly,  Maubeuge,  Sandouville,  Moscow  and  Cordoba  are P Renault  plants  that  produce  vehicles  for  Nissan.  In  2020, Sandouville started the production of a van for Mitsubishi;\n- the Renault plants in Maubeuge and Novo Mesto produce vehicles P for Daimler;\n- Sandouville  and  Batilly  produce  light  commercial  vehicles  for P other partners such as GM, Renault Trucks or Fiat;\n- finally, in India, Renault and Nissan share a plant common to both. P\n\nFor  the  production  of  powertrain  parts,  the  cross-utilization  of Alliance  plants  provides  manufacturing  opportunities  that  allow  us to  share  investments  and  optimize  the  use  of  our  production capacities. Some examples:\n\n- for  Nissan  and  Daimler,  diesel  engines  are  produced  in  the P Renault  plants  in  Cl\u00e9on  and  Valladolid  and  gasoline  engines  in Valladolid and Pitesti;\n- in  Europe,  Nissan's  Sunderland  plant  produces  engines  for P Renault.  In  Japan,  Nissan's  Yokohama  plant  also  produces  a gasoline  engine  for  Renault.  In  India,  Nissan's  Chennai  plant produces powertrains for Renault;\n- gearboxes  are  assembled  for  Daimler  and  Nissan  in  Cl\u00e9on,  for P Nissan in Pitesti, Seville, Cacia and Los Andes;\n- AVTOVAZ  assembles  engines  and  gearboxes  for  Renault  and P Nissan;\n- the  Le  Mans  plant  manufactures  chassis  for  Nissan,  Mitsubishi, P Daimler and GM as well as for Groupe Renault brands.",

These  sites  have  the  role  of  supplementing the territorial coverage of the catchment areas of Renault's primary networks.\n\nThe  main  change  in  our  distribution  network  is  the  accelerated marketing  of  our  'E-TECH'  range  of  vehicles  -  EV,  PH-EV,  HEV  with  the  widespread  roll-out  of  Expert  Sites,  which  enable  us  to provide all the services related to these New Energies.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  main  initiatives  taken  to  support  our  sales network in 2020 focused on:\n\n- the  recommendation  of  a  very  strict  health  protocol  to  manage P the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  activities,  while developing new remote services to ensure continuity of service for customers;\n- the  upgrade  of  our  network  in  terms  of  training,  equipment, P methods  and  charging  infrastructure  in  order  to  market  and maintain the entire E-TECH range under the best conditions, as it represents a growing part of our sales mix;\n- the  continuation  of  our  policy  aimed  at  improving  customer P satisfaction  by  constantly  upgrading  our  methods  (for  the development of remote solutions for example) and supporting our network in their implementation.\n\n|                                          | 2020      | 2020       | 2019      | 2019       |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|\n| Number of Renault sites                  | Worldwide | o/w Europe | Worldwide | o/w Europe |\n| Primary network                          | 5,084     | 2,670      | 4, 872    | 2,469      |\n| o/w RRG dealers and branches             | 193       | 185        | 205       | 190        |\n| o/w Renault Pro+ specialized dealerships | 664       | 525        | 626       | 485        |\n| Secondary network                        | 5,569     | 5,249      | 6, 026    | 5,709      |\n| TOTAL SITES                              | 10,653    | 7,919      | 10,898    | 8,174      |\n|                                          | 2020      | 2020       | 2019      | 2019       |\n| Number of Dacia sites                    | Worldwide | o/w Europe | Worldwide | o/w Europe |\n| Primary network                          | 3,057     | 2,679      | 2,838     | 2,456      |\n|                                          | 2020      | 2020       | 2019      | 2019       |\n| Number of Alpine sites                   | Worldwide | Europe     | Worldwide | Europe     |\n| Primary network                          | 81        | 60         | 81        | 59         |\n|                                          | 2020      | 2020       | 2019      | 2019       |\n| Number of Renault Samsung Motors sites   |           | Korea      |           | Korea      |\n| Primary network*                         |           | 715        |           | 665        |\n| change in scope *                        |           |            |           |            |\n|                                          | 2020      | 2020       | 2019      | 2019       |\n| Number of Lada sites                     | Worldwide | o/w Russia | Worldwide | o/w Russia |\n| Primary network                          | 470       | 296        | 594       | 288        |\n|                                          | 2020      | 2020       | 2019      | 2019       |\n| Number of Jinbe\u00ef sites                   |           | China      |           | China      |\n| Primary network                          |           | 246        |           | 288        |\n\nI",

These Renault Pro+ specialized dealerships are bound by a triple customer pledge based on:\n\n- the  specialization  of  sales  teams  and  after-sales  staff,  with  a P dedicated area for business customers;\n- a large range of options, including for chassis cabs, facilitated by P the wide range of vehicles on display and available for test drive;\n- guaranteed  mobility  for  business  customers  with  a  dedicated P after-sales team.\n\n## Automotive cash flow management 1.1.3.7\n\nFor  Automotive,  Groupe  Renault  has  established  a  financial organization whose aims are to:\n\n- automate the processing of routine cash inflows and outflows; P\n- meet the subsidiaries' refinancing requirements and pool surplus P cash;\n- centralize the handling of euro-denominated  and  foreign P exchange  transactions  so  as  to  optimize  the  management  of currency,  liquidity,  interest  rate,  counterparty  and  country  risk while reducing financial and administrative costs;\n- centralize  virtually  all  financing  operations,  including  securities P issuance,  bank  loans  and  credit  agreements,  at  parent  company level.\n\nWithin this framework, Renault's Financing and Treasury department,  which  is  responsible  for  cash  management  and financing  for  the  Group's  industrial  and  commercial  activities  in Europe, has a specialized entity, Renault Finance, which it uses to:\n\n- conduct  capital  market  trading  after  intra-Group  netting:  forex, P rates, commodities and short-term investments;\n- make  foreign  currency  payments  for  French  and  European P subsidiaries;\n- conduct  cash  pooling  in  the  currencies  of  certain  subsidiaries P (United Kingdom, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia and the Czech Republic).\n\nFor  the  euro  zone,  cash  is  centralized  through  a  Renault  SA  IT platform that manages all subsidiaries' euro-denominated transactions and interfaces with the automotive sector's banks.\n\nOutside  the  euro  zone,  Renault  Finance  offers  certain  subsidiaries access to centralized cash management tools.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "OVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\n## Renault Finance\n\nA Swiss company domiciled in Lausanne, Renault Finance is active in the  international  financial  markets,  following  a  set  of  strict  risk management  rules.  Its  arbitrage  activity  allows  it  to  obtain  very competitive  quotes  for  financial  products  from  foreign  exchange markets,  interest  rates  or  raw  materials.  This  makes  it  Renault's natural  counterparty  for  most  automotive  market  transactions.  By extending  this  service  to  the  Nissan  group,  Renault  Finance  has become the Alliance's trading room.\n\nTo  optimize  the  quality  of  the  service  provided  to  the  Alliance, Renault Finance is equipped with some of the most advanced tools on  the  interbank  markets  and  has  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  in Singapore, Renault Treasury Services.\n\n## Nissan, AVTOVAZ, partnerships and 1.1.3.8 cooperations\n\n## Nissan\n\nRenault's shareholding in Nissan is described in detail in section 1.2 'The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance'.\n\nNissan's market capitalization at December 31, 2020 was \u00a52,364 billion (\u20ac18,686 million), based on a closing price of \u00a5560 per Nissan share.\n\nRenault  holds  43.4%  of  Nissan's  share  capital.  At  December 31, 2020,  the  market  value  of  the  shares  held  by  Renault  totaled \u20ac8,110 million, based on a conversion rate of \u00a5126.49 for \u20ac1.\n\nRenault  accounts  for  its  shareholding  in  Nissan  using  the  equity method,  as  described  in  Chapter 4,  note 12  of  the  notes  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## AVTOVAZ\n\nIn  Russia,  AVTOVAZ,  the  Russian  market  leader,  continued  its recovery in 2020, despite the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the Russian automotive market and exports.\n\nFor  the  fourth  consecutive  year,  AVTOVAZ  made  a  positive contribution to Groupe Renault's results with market share in Russia increasing  to  21.5%  and  an  operating  margin  of  \u20ac141  million, i.e. 5.5% of revenues.\n\nThese  results  are  the  fruit  of  the  mid-term  plan  approved  by AVTOVAZ shareholders in 2016, which aims to achieve a return to growth and profitability. In 2020, AVTOVAZ was able to offset less favorable  market  conditions  and  exchange  rates  thanks  to  the in-depth restructuring of  the  company  undertaken  in  recent  years, which  focused  on  reducing  costs  by  increasing  local  integration, boosting  exports  and  developing  product  ranges  in  anticipation  of the launch of a new product plan validated by shareholders at the end of 2020.\n\nIn  2020,  AVTOVAZ  finalized  the  integration  of  the  activities  of  its subsidiary  LADA  West  resulting  from  the  purchase  at  the  end  of 2019 of GM's share of the GM-AVTOVAZ joint venture. That enabled AVTOVAZ to take over the right to use the NIVA trademark, which will  be  extended  to  future  LADA  models  intended  to  revive  the brand.\n\nAt  the  end  of  December  2019,  Renault's  stake  in  Alliance  Rostec Auto B.V. was 67.61%, with Alliance Rostec Auto B.V. holding 100% of  the  capital  of  AVTOVAZ,  which  was  transformed  into  a  private company in 2019.\n\nI\n\n## Strategic cooperation between the Renault-Nissan alliance and Daimler AG\n\nSee paragraph 'Cooperation with Daimler' in section 1.2.4.\n\n## Autonomous vehicles\n\nIn  June 2019,  Groupe  Renault  and  Nissan  signed  an  exclusive Alliance  agreement  with  Waymo  for  the  study  of  autonomous mobility services for people and goods in France and Japan.\n\nThis  agreement  pools  the  three  partners'  strengths  and  extends their expertise through the assessment of market opportunities and joint  research  work  on  commercial,  legal  and  regulatory  issues related to autonomous mobility service offers in France and Japan. Their  international  dimension  and  the  complementary  fit  of  their offers,  covering  every  segment  of  light  commercial  vehicles  and passenger  cars,  perfectly  position  Groupe  Renault  and  Nissan  to undertake this exploratory work with Waymo,  a  company specializing  in  driverless  technologies  with  more  than  32  million kilometers on roads under its belt.\n\n## New mobilities and services\n\nFor  five  years,  Groupe  Renault  has  been  committed  to  the development of new shared mobility services (Renault Mobility, Zity in Madrid and Paris since May 2020, in partnership with the Ferrovial group), and has made targeted acquisitions and equity investments in various start-ups in the field (Karhoo, iCabbi, two new acquisitions (Mobile Knowledge in Canada and Original Software in Brazil), Glide). The World Mobility department, assisted by Renault M.A.I. (Mobility as  an  Industry),  was  able  to  accelerate  synergies,  simplify  the decision-making  chain,  clarify  existing  offers  and  create  new  ones, prior to the launch of Mobilize in 2021, which will bring together all services (financial with RCI Bank, Energy, Mobility).\n\nIn  conjunction with various partners, Groupe Renault develops and offers its customers energy-related services so that they can enjoy the  full  benefits  of  their  electric  vehicles.  In  2020,  for  instance, Renault  created  Elexent  to  offer  its  professional  customers tailor-made  recharging  solutions,  which  are  gradually  being  rolled out  with  local  partners  in  Europe.  In  France,  Renault  has  joined forces  with  Solstyce,  a  company  specializing  in  the  design  and installation of charging solutions. Since 2017, Renault has also been partnering  with  Jedlix,  a  Dutch  technology  startup  with  which Renault  has  developed  an  intelligent  mobile  charging  app  for  the smart charging of electric vehicles, guaranteeing users carbon-free electricity  and  savings  on  their  energy  bills.  This  service,  already operational in the Netherlands and France, is now to be rolled out in other European countries. In France (Tokai1) and Germany (Tokai2), Renault  is  developing  an  original  and  innovative  solution  called Advanced Battery Storage. Operational in Douai and Elverlingsen, it consists in using electric vehicle batteries before their use in vehicles in  order  to  maximize  the  sites'  self-consumption  of  renewable energy  and  stabilize  the  electricity  grid  while  improving  battery warranty  costs. The  Mobility  House,  Caisse  des  D\u00e9p\u00f4ts  et Consignations, Demeter and Mitsui are partners in this project. Also noteworthy is  the  creation  in  2013  of  tech  company  Gireve,  which has developed an interoperability platform for charging infrastructure  operators  to  facilitate  roaming  for  electric  vehicle drivers.  Gireve  acts  as  a  contractual,  technical  and  operational interface  between  the  various  systems.  Renault,  CNR,  Caisse  des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts, EDF, Enedis and Demeter are partners.",

RVC  aims  to  promote Renault's  embrace  of  open  innovation  and  to  create  links  with emerging businesses in the future fields of automotive products and services. This activity, which is an ideal complement to Research and Development  carried  out  internally,  create  an  image  of  proactivity focused  on  open  innovation  and  joint  development  and  will  allow faster decision-making.\n\nIn  2019,  RVC  accordingly  financed  the  launch  of  a  Renault 'GeoTwin'  spin-off,  which  hopes  to  develop  a  multi-agent  urban mobility platform designed to help urban communities and mobility stakeholders  to  plan  and  scale  their  mobility  offers  to  make transportation in cities smoother for users.\n\nThree  other  companies  also  joined  the  RVC  portfolio  in  2019: Devialet, (FR, high-end sound technology), AVSimulation, (FR, virtual driving simulation) and Propheese, (FR, Neurovision image technology).\n\nRVC strengthened its commitment to the start-up Jedlix (NL), which has a solution unique in Europe to directly control the charging of vehicles without using electronic charging stations.\n\nRVC did not acquire any new shareholdings in 2020.\n\nOVERVIEW OF RENAULT AND THE GROUP\n\n## Light commercial vehicles\n\nRenault  manages  several  agreements  with  Opel,  Nissan,  Renault Trucks, Daimler and Fiat.\n\nIn the compact van segment: in 2014, Renault signed a cooperation agreement with Fiat for the manufacturing at the Sandouville plant of  a  compact  van  developed  by  Renault  based  on  the  TRAFIC,  the TALENTO. Production and sale of the vehicle began in 2016.\n\nUnder  the  Renault-Nissan  alliance,  an  agreement  was  signed  with Nissan for the manufacturing at the Sandouville plant of a compact van  developed  by  Renault  based  on  the  TRAFIC,  the  NV300. Production  and  sale  of  the  vehicle  began  in  2016.  Also  within  the framework of the Alliance, a version of the TRAFIC for Australia and New Zealand for Mitsubishi was launched in June 2020.\n\nIn  the  heavy  van  segment,  production  of  the  MASTER  and  the Opel/Vauxhall MOVANO started at the Batilly plant in 2010. Movano was sold to Opel/Vauxhall as part of a commercial agreement signed at the end of 2007.\n\nThe MASTER is also distributed by the Renault Trucks network under the terms of a sales agreement entered into in 2009.\n\nUnder  the  Renault-Nissan  alliance,  an  agreement  was  signed  with Nissan for the manufacturing at the Batilly plant of a van developed by Renault based on the MASTER, the NV400. Production and sale of the vehicle began in 2011.\n\nIn the van segment, as part of the strategic cooperation between the Renault-Nissan  alliance  and  Daimler  announced  in  2010,  Renault has developed Mercedes-Benz's new urban light commercial vehicle, the  KANGOO-based  CITAN.  It  is  manufactured  in  the  Maubeuge plant and has been marketed by Mercedes since 2012. In 2019 and 2020, the agreements between Renault and Daimler were renewed and extended for the manufacture in Maubeuge of its successor and its  electric  version  based on the new KANGOO. It will be marketed under the names CITAN (van) and T-CLASS (passenger).\n\nUnder  the  Renault-Nissan  alliance,  an  agreement  was  signed  with Nissan for the manufacturing at the Maubeuge plant of a small van developed by Renault based on the KANGOO, the NV250. Production and sale of the vehicle began in late 2019 to replace the NV200.\n\nIn  the  pick-up  segment,  in  the  context  of  the  Renault-Nissan alliance,  Renault  signed  an  agreement  with  Nissan  in  2015  for  the development  and  production  of  a  Renault  pick-up,  the  ALASKAN, based on the Nissan NP300. This vehicle is produced in the Nissan plant  in  Cuernavaca,  Mexico,  and  was  launched  commercially  in Colombia  in  2016.  Since  2017,  the  vehicle  has  also  been manufactured in the Nissan plant in Barcelona (Spain) and marketed in  Europe  under  the  name  ALASKAN.  It  is  also  made  in  the  Santa Isabel plant (Argentina) for Nissan, and was launched commercially on the Argentinian market under the name ALASKAN in November 2020.",

Both  shareholders  of  MAIS and  Oyak  Renault  have  declared  that  they  will  continue  their cooperation  for  another  27 years,  signing  a  new  shareholder agreement and new side agreements on June 26, 2018.\n\nThis contract governs the largest cooperation ever in the Turkish car industry  and  covers  Groupe  Renault's  industrial  and  commercial activities in Turkey. Oyak Renault will continue to play a key role in Groupe Renault's industrial operations for the production and export of  vehicles,  engines  and  transmissions.  MAIS  will  continue  to manage  sales  and  after-sales  operations  for  vehicles,  spare  parts and services for the Renault and Dacia brands.\n\nThese  agreements  have  not  changed  the  distribution  of  the shareholders'  ownership  of  each  of  the  entities  (MAIS:  51%  Oyak Group - 49% Groupe Renault; Oyak Renault: 51% Groupe Renault, 49% Oyak Group).\n\n## In China\n\nRenault  ended  its  cooperation  with  the  Dongfeng  Group  in  April 2020.  It  sold  its  shares  in  DRAC  (Dongfeng  Renault  Automotive Company), which has ceased activities related to the Renault brand.\n\nRenault  Brilliance  Jinbei  Automotive  Company  (RBJAC),  a  joint venture  with  CBA  (China  Automotive  Holding  Limited)  since December 2017, is 49% owned by Renault and markets a range of light commercial vehicles under the Jinbei brand. RBJAC is located in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province.\n\neGT was created in September 2017 by Renault (25%), Nissan (25%) and  Dongfeng  (50%).  The  company  is  based  in  Shiyan  (Hubei Province)  and  is  dedicated  to  the  development  of  the  K-ZE (China)/SPRING  (Europe).  The  first  vehicles  destined  for  Europe rolled off the production line at the end of 2020.\n\nIn April 2019, Renault and Nissan also created a new jointly-owned (50/50)  innovation  platform  in  Shanghai  called  Alliance  Innovation Lab Shanghai (AIL-SH). The company is responsible for research and development  in  connected  and  autonomous  vehicles.  Finally, Renault opened a design center in Shanghai.\n\nIn July 2019, Renault and Jiangling Motors Corporation Group (JMCG) announced  the  creation  of  a  joint  venture  (JMEV)  to  promote  the growth of the electric vehicle industry in China. This company sells vehicles in China under the EV Easy brand and will be able to export outside China from the end of 2021. JMEV is located in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province.\n\nI\n\n## In India\n\nIn  Chennai,  the  Alliance  continues  to  build  its  joint  production  site with  Nissan  JV  (RNAIPL).  Production  began  in  2010.  Currently,  the DUSTER, KWID and, since August 2019, the new TRIBER vehicle are produced there  for  Renault.  In  2020,  Renault  sold  80,000  vehicles. Renault  also  exports  models  made  in  India  to  Sri Lanka,  Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh with the support of local importers in those countries.\n\nIn the same region, the joint venture between Renault and Nissan, RNTBCI,  has  provided  engineering,  computer,  purchasing  and accounting services for all of the entities in the Alliance around the world since 2008. A significant part of its services are performed on behalf of the entities of the Alliance in India, thus contributing to the commercial development of the Alliance in that country.\n\n## In Iran\n\nRenault  maintains  its  presence  in  strict  compliance  with  the  legal restrictions  set  by  international  regulations  for  the  country.  As  a result,  Renault  decided  to  drastically  limit  its  activities  in  Iran. Accordingly, deliveries of KD parts to Iran ceased on August 6, 2018 and Renault Pars limited its activities to after-sales.\n\nThe  Iranian  business  was  taken  out  of  the  Group's  consolidated scope in 2013.\n\n## In South Africa\n\nFollowing  the  cooperation  agreement  signed  with  Nissan,  the LOGAN Pick-up is assembled locally in Nissan's Rosslyn factory since 2009.  The  NP200  LOGAN  Pick-up  is  marketed  under  the  Nissan brand.\n\nSince  December 2013,  Renault  South  Africa  (RSA)  has  been  40% owned  by  Renault  s.a.s  and  60%  by  Motus.  Motus  is  the  new company  created  at  the  end  of  2017  to  bring  all  Automotive activities of the Imperial Group, Renault's long-standing commercial partner  in  the  country,  together  under  one  roof.  This  partnership enabled  the  acceleration  of  Groupe  Renault's  expansion  in  that country from a 3.0% market share in 2014 to a 4.6% share in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the TRIBER was launched on the market. Renault sales in South Africa reached 16,600 vehicles.\n\n## In Algeria\n\nThe  Oran  plant  is  managed  by  Renault  Alg\u00e9rie  Production,  a partnership between Renault (49%), the SNVI (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des V\u00e9hicules Industriels, 34%) and the FNI (Fonds National d'Investissement, 17%).\n\nThe plant has been idle since January 2020.",

The main impacts (3) stem from the generation of organic capital (4) ,  with  the  2020  forecast  dividend  being  limited  to  \u20ac69 million.  This  is  in  accordance  with  recommendations  from  the  ECB on dividend payments. If these recommendations are not extended beyond September 30, 2021, and in the absence of an unanticipated unfavorable event, RCI plans to pay an additional dividend of around \u20ac930 million as soon as possible. This would impact the Core Equity Tier One ratio by -2.7%.\n\n## Financial policy\n\nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  profoundly  affected  economies  and markets  throughout  2020.  Governments  and  central  banks  took quick action to avoid a major and lasting economic crisis.\n\nInitially  confined  to  China  and  Asia,  the  coronavirus  epidemic subsequently  spread  worldwide.  Between  March  and  April  2020, fears of a health crisis led many countries to impose strict lockdown measures,  which  had  a  major  impact  on  economic  activity  and consumption.  To  prevent  the  health  crisis  from  triggering  a  major economic  crisis,  the  key  central  banks  took  far-reaching  monetary policy initiatives.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  the  Federal  Reserve  reactivated  an  asset purchase  program  spanning  government,  municipal  and  corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and securitization instruments in a total amount of US$2,600 billion. It also cut the Fed Funds rate to 0-0.25%,  bringing  the  reduction  to  150  basis  points  since  the beginning of March, and is guiding on near-zero interest rates until 2022  at  least.  In  July,  the  Fed  modified  its  long-term  policy  to achieve an average target interest rate of 2% and allow for flexibility in  monetary  policy  with  a  view  to  achieving  a  return  to  full employment.\n\nThe European Central Bank introduced a new emergency purchasing program  in  response  to  the  pandemic.  Initially  intended  to  total \u20ac750 billion, the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) was  later  increased  to  \u20ac1,850  billion.  The  terms  of  the  TLTRO  III were  also  eased  by  lowering  the  interest  rate  and  a  downward recalibration of the growth targets that banks must meet in order to benefit  from  the  subsidized  rate.  In  July,  the  27  European  Union member  states  also  reached  an  agreement  on  a  \u20ac750  billion stimulus plan, split between \u20ac390 billion in grants and \u20ac360 billion in loans to fund post-pandemic recovery efforts.\n\nThe  Bank  of  England  followed  the  lead  of  the  Fed  and  the  ECB, lowering  its  base  rate  in  two  steps  from  0.75%  to  0.10%,  and strengthening its \u00a3200 billion non-bank investment grade government and corporate bond buyback program in March 2020.\n\nEquity indices nevertheless fell sharply in February and March, and credit spreads widened significantly. During the second half, marked\n\nby  the  lifting  of  lockdown  measures,  market  conditions  gradually returned  to  normal  before  a  temporary  upturn  in  risk  aversion sparked by the resurgence of the health crisis in late October. The election  of  a  new  Democratic  President  in  the  USA  in  early November and growing hopes for the development of an effective vaccine against COVID-19  allowed  equity markets to rally significantly and risk premiums to tighten in the bond markets. The agreement  reached  on  the  terms  of  Brexit  and  the  start  of vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 also provided the markets with support in early 2021.\n\nDown  36%  at  its  intra-year  low,  the  Eurostox  50  ended  the  year down 5%. At the same time, corporate bond credit spreads (IBOXX Corporate  Overall  index)  experienced  similar  volatility,  rising  from 70bp  in  January  to  200bp  at  the  end  of  March,  before  ending  the year at 74bp.\n\nRecourse to market financing was modest during the year, and the company was not particularly impacted by the increase in financing costs.  The  situation  resulted  from  lower  2020  bond  redemptions than  in  previous  years  (anticipation  of  the  refinancing  of  TLTRO  II launched  in  2016),  the  slowdown  in  car  sales  and  the  resulting decline  in  new  loan  volume.  A  \u20ac750  million  7-year  fixed-rate  bond was issued in January.\n\nRetail  customer  deposits  have  increased  by  \u20ac2.8  billion  since December  2019  and  totaled  \u20ac20.5  billion  at  December  31,  2020, representing 43% of net assets at the end of December.\n\nIn  the  secured  refinancing  segment,  private  securitizations  of  car loans in the UK and leasing in Germany saw their revolving periods extended for another year. The French subsidiary also carried out its first  securitization  of  automobile  lease  purchase  option  (LOA) receivables in France in the amount of \u20ac991.5 million, split between \u20ac950  million  in  senior  securities  (including  \u20ac200  million  in self-subscribed  securities) and  \u20ac41.5  million  in  subordinated securities.\n\nThese resources, to which should be added, based on the European scope, \u20ac4.5 billion of undrawn committed credit lines, \u20ac4.5 billion of assets  eligible  as  collateral  in  ECB  monetary  policy  operations  and \u20ac7.4 billion of high quality liquid assets (HQLA), enable RCI Banque to maintain the financing granted to its customers for more than 12 months without access to external sources of liquidity. At December 31,  2020,  RCI  Banque's  liquidity  reserve  (European  scope)  stood  at \u20ac16.6  billion,  an  increase  of  \u20ac7.1  billion  compared  with  the  end  of 2019.\n\nIn  a  complex  and  volatile  environment,  the  conservative  financial policy  implemented  by  the  group  for  a  number  of  years  proved especially  justified.  This  policy  protects  the  commercial  margin  of each entity while securing the refinancing required for its business activities.  It  is  defined  and  implemented  at  a  consolidated  level  by RCI  Banque  and  applies  to  all  sales  financing  entities  within  the group.\n\n- Ratio including interim profits net of forecast dividends, subject to the approval of the regulator in accordance with Article 26 (2) of (1) Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.\n- TRIM related headwinds globally in line with expectations reported in February 2020 and compensated by activation of certain CRR options (3) (netting of deferred tax, Credit Conversion Factor).\n- Impact of a \u20ac300 million residual 2019 dividend cancellation at end-December 2019 is +86bps on CET1.

        "page_content": "THE ALLIANCE\n\n## THE ALLIANCE 1.2\n\n## Overview 1.2.1\n\nThe Alliance between the Renault and Nissan groups constitutes the most sustainable and productive multi-cultural strategic collaboration  in  the  automotive  industry.  For  more  than  20 years, this  partnership  has  offered  a  unique,  pragmatic  and  agile  model, always  able  to  evolve  and  integrate  new  projects  and  partners. Extended  to  Mitsubishi  group,  it  forms  the  largest  automotive alliance in the world.\n\n## History 1.2.2\n\nOn  March 27,  1999,  Renault  and  Nissan  Motor  Co.  Ltd  ('Nissan') entered  into  the  founding  agreement  of  the  Alliance,  the  Alliance and  Equity  Participation  Agreement  (the  'AEPA').  Under  the provisions of the AEPA, Renault acquired a 36.8% stake in Nissan's share  capital  and  subscribed  for  share  subscription  warrants  that enabled it to increase its stake first to 39.9% and then to 44.4% of Nissan's  capital.  For  its  part,  Nissan  was  given  the  opportunity  to acquire a stake in Renault in the future.\n\nNissan's turnaround and the Alliance's rapid success led the partners to  take  a  new  step  forward  by  accelerating  the  implementation  of their  financial  agreements,  and  further  institutionalizing  their commercial and industrial cooperation.\n\nAccordingly, on December 20, 2000, Renault and Nissan entered into the  Alliance's  second  framework  agreement,  the  'Alliance  Master Agreement'  (the  'AMA'),  which  was  reiterated  and  updated  on March 28,  2002  in  the  'Restated  Alliance  Master  Agreement'  (the 'RAMA').\n\nUnder the AMA and then the RAMA, Renault strengthened its stake in  Nissan,  and  Nissan  acquired  a  15%  stake  in  Renault's  share capital:\n\n- on  March 1,  2002,  Renault  increased  its  stake  in  Nissan  from P 36.8%  to  44.4%;  on  April 6,  2010,  a  share  exchange  agreement between Renault, Nissan and Daimler resulted in Renault's stake in  Nissan  decreasing  from  44.4%  to  43.4%  at  the  same  time  as Daimler entered the capital of Renault and Nissan; and\n- on March 29, 2002 and May 28, 2002, Nissan increased its stake in P Renault to 15% through two capital increases reserved to Nissan Finance Co. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nissan.\n\nPursuant  to  Article L. 233-31  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the Renault  shares  held  by  Nissan  Finance  Co.  Ltd  are  not  taken  into account in the calculation of the quorum, and do not confer voting rights, i.e. ,  the  voting  rights  attached  to  such  shares  cannot  be exercised at Annual General Meetings.\n\nI\n\nThe Alliance has proven its leadership in zero-emission vehicles and is developing the innovative technologies of tomorrow's autonomous, connected and affordable vehicles.\n\nThe  Alliance  aims  to  create  value  for  each  partner  and  for  all stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, etc .).\n\nIn  application  of  the  RAMA,  Renault-Nissan  B.V.  ('RNBV')  was formed  on  March 28,  2002.  This  Amsterdam-based  company  has been  owned  equally  by  Renault  and  Nissan  since  2002.  It  was formed  to  coordinate  the  common  activities  on  a  global  scale  and contribute to the preparation of the Alliance's strategy and mid and long-term planning (see section 1.2.3.2 'Powers of RNBV').\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  increase  by  the  French  State's  stake  in  the share capital of Renault in 2015 and then the introduction of double voting  rights,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Renault  authorized,  on December 11, 2015, the signing of the following agreements, which the  Shareholders'  Annual  General  Meeting  approved  on  April 29, 2016:\n\n- a  governance  agreement  entered  into  on  February 4,  2016 P between Renault and the French State, aimed at restricting  the free  exercise  of  the  French  State's  voting  rights  for  certain decisions  submitted  to  Renault's  Shareholders'  Annual  General Meeting.\n- This  agreement  is  described  in  section 5.2.6.2  'Shareholders' agreements on shares and voting rights of the Company'; and\n- a  third  amendment  to  the  RAMA  signed  on  December 11,  2015 P between  Renault  and  Nissan  that  enshrines  in  particular  the constant practice of non-interference of Renault in the governance of Nissan.\n\nOn November 2, 2017, the French State sold the 14 million Renault shares  acquired  in  2015.  On  that  occasion,  and  in  accordance  with applicable  regulations,  Renault  bought  back  1,400,000 shares  ( i.e. , 10%  of  the  shares  sold  by  the  French  State)  with  the  aim  of implementing  an  offer  reserved  for  employees  and  former employees of the Group.\n\nThe  agreements  concluded  between  with  the  French  State  and Nissan remain in force.",

This is a body that oversees the operations and governance of the Alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors and heralds a new beginning for the world's leading automotive alliance.\n\n## Functioning of the Alliance in 2020 1.2.3\n\n## The Alliance Operating Board 1.2.3.1\n\nThe  Alliance  Operating  Board,  created  on  March  12,  2019,  is  in charge  of  operational  coordination  between  Renault,  Nissan  and Mitsubishi Motors and will take new initiatives that will create value for their respective shareholders and employees.\n\nThis  new  Alliance  Operating  Board  comprises  four  members, appointed by Renault (two members, including the Chairman of the Alliance  Operating  Board),  by  Nissan  (one  member),  and  by Mitsubishi Motors (one member).\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Alliance  Operating  Board  was composed  of  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors of Renault and Chairman of the Alliance Operating Board, Makoto Uchida, Chief Executive Officer of Nissan, Luca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Renault, and Takao Kato, Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors (following the resignation and death of Osamu Masuko in August 2020).\n\nThe  decisions  of  the  Alliance  Operating  Board  are  made  by  all members by consensus, in accordance with the Alliance's 'win-win' principle. The Alliance Operating Board meets monthly, and as often as  the  Alliance's  interest  requires,  in  Paris  or  Yokohama,  or  by video-conference when necessary.\n\nThe  Alliance  Operating  Board  oversees  Alliance  operations  and governance issues involving Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors. In practice, the Board replaces RNBV in its governance functions. In any  event,  RNBV  continues  to  exist,  and  supports  the  Alliance Operating  Board,  particularly  for  decisions  and  proposals  that  are delegated  to  RNBV  pursuant  to  the  RAMA,  the  Management Agreements and the articles  of  association  of  Renault  s.a.s  and  of RNBV.\n\nThe  Alliance  Operating  Board's  General  Secretary,  Hadi  Zablit, appointed  December  2019,  is  tasked  with  coordinating  and facilitating  the  Alliance'  major  projects  launched  to  accelerate  the operating efficiency of the respective companies. He reports to the Alliance Operating Board.\n\nThe  Alliance  Operating  Board  is  assisted  by  specific  operating committees  that  make  recommendations  on  new  sources  of  value creation  between  the  three  carmakers.  During  2020,  the  Alliance Operating  Board  worked  on  programs  aiming  at  significantly improving  and  accelerating  the  operating  effectiveness  of  the Alliance  in  the  interest  of  the  three  companies,  including  action plans whose objective is to maximize the contribution of the Alliance in  order  to  support  the  strategic  plan  and  the  operating  results  of each company.\n\nIn 2020, the three partner companies reaffirmed that the Alliance is essential  for  strategic  growth  and  improving  their  respective competitiveness.\n\nThus,  on  May  27,  2020,  the  Alliance  announced  the  adoption  of  a new business model for cooperation.\n\nAlliance partners will use the leader-follower model to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of vehicles and technologies.\n\nEach member will become a benchmark in the regions where it has the best strategic assets, and will act as a facilitator and provider of support bolstering the competitiveness of the other members.\n\nThe three members plan to build on the Alliance's existing strengths, such  as  joint  purchasing,  by  leveraging  their  respective  leadership positions  and  geographic  strengths  to  support  their  partners' development.\n\nThe aim is to:\n\n- strengthen the Alliance's standardization strategy, from platform P to complete vehicle;\n- determine, by product segment, a 'parent vehicle' (or leader car), P and  'sister  vehicles'  (or  follower  cars),  developed  by  the  leader company with the support of the follower team;\n- ensure that the three companies' leader and follower vehicles are P produced in the most competitive environment possible, including by combining production where appropriate;\n- continue to develop synergies on commercial vehicles, where the P leader-follower model is already applied.\n\nI",

These benefits are set to compound the synergies already achieved to date.\n\nThe  Alliance  also  approved  the  principle  of  designating  different parts  of  the  world  as  'reference  regions',  with  each  company focusing  on  its  key  regions  in  the  aim  of  being  among  the  most competitive  and  serving  as  a  benchmark  for  others  to  strengthen their own competitiveness.\n\nOn this principle, Nissan will become the reference in China, North America and Japan; Renault for Europe, Russia, South America and North Africa; and Mitsubishi Motors for ASEAN and Oceania.\n\nAs  each  member  becomes  a  reference  in  its  respective  region, synergies will increase in order to maximize the sharing of fixed costs and the exploitation of each company's assets.\n\nTaking  all  these  elements  into  account,  nearly  50%  of  Alliance models will be developed and manufactured under the \"leader-follower\" model by 2025.\n\nIn terms of technological efficiency, Alliance members will continue to capitalize on existing assets to ensure that each member company continues  to  share  investments  in  platforms,  powertrains  and technologies.  Sharing  of  this  nature  has  already  proved  its effectiveness in the development of powertrains and platforms, and has  led  to  the  successful  launch  of  the  CMF-B  platform  for  the Renault CLIO and the Nissan JUKE, as well as the KEI Car platform for  Nissan  DAYS and the Mitsubishi eK WAGON. The CMF-C/D and CMF-EV platforms will follow soon.\n\nThe  new  business  model  will  be  extended  from  platforms  and powertrains  to  all  key  technologies,  with  leadership  assigned  as follows:\n\n- autonomous driving: Nissan; P\n- connected car technologies: Renault for the Android platform and P Nissan in China;\n- e-body  -  the  main  system  of  electric-electronic  architecture: P Renault;\n- e-PowerTrain (ePT) engine: CMF-A/B ePT - Renault, CMF-EV ePT P - Nissan;\n- PHEV for the C/D segments: Mitsubishi. P\n\nThis  new  model  of  cooperation  will  enable  member  companies  to make  the  most  of  their  expertise  and  competitiveness,  which  will strengthen the Alliance as a whole in a changing global automotive environment.\n\n## Renault-Nissan B.V. (RNBV) 1.2.3.2\n\nSince  2002,  RNBV  has  had  decision-making  and  recommendation powers  that  it  exercises  in  consensus  with  each  partner  and  in compliance with their interests.\n\nThese  decision-making  and  recommendation  powers  are  exercised in  areas  that  affect  Alliance-wide  strategy  and  planning.  RNBV's decisions and recommendations reflect the common positions of the Alliance  partners.  They  are  made  in  compliance  with  Renault's corporate interest.\n\nFurthermore, RNBV has control over Alliance Purchasing Organization (APO), created in April 2001 under the corporate name\n\nI\n\nRenault-Nissan Purchasing Organization (RNPO), of which RNBV has been the sole shareholder since June 24, 2003.\n\nRNBV does not intervene in the operational management of Renault or  Nissan  and  does  not  share  in  the  profits  or  bear  the  associated risks.  Operational  decisions  are  made  and  implemented  by  each company  to  the  extent  that  such  company  is  affected  by  them, including decisions on the so-called converged activities.\n\nThis company is not consolidated due to its non-significant nature, in accordance with the accounting principles described in note 2-B of the consolidated financial statements presented in section 4-2.\n\n## Powers of RNBV\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  RAMA  and  Article 15  of  the  Renault  s.a.s articles  of  association,  Renault  and  Nissan  have  delegated  certain powers to RNBV pursuant to a management agreement signed  on April 17,  2002  for  an  initial  period  of  10 years  (the 'Management Agreement' ).\n\nIn April 2012, the Management Agreement was renewed for another 10-year  period  pursuant  to  an  agreement  entitled Renewal Agreement of the Management Agreement, the provisions of which are identical to those of the Management Agreement (the ' Renewal Agreement  of  the  Management  Agreement '). Renault  were informed of this at Renault's 2012 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe delegation of powers granted to RNBV will expire on April 16, 2022. The Renault shareholders will be informed of the renewal of the Management Agreement .\n\nThe  list  of  powers  delegated  to  RNBV  is  restrictive  and  has  not changed since the creation of the Alliance.\n\nFirst and foremost, RNBV has decision-making powers that cover:\n\n- adoption of 3-, 5- and 10-year plans (strategic Company projects, P with quantified data);\n- approval of product plans (phase of strategic projects P corresponding to the design, manufacturing and sale of current or future products, vehicles and components);\n- decisions  concerning  the  sharing  of  products  and  powertrains P (such  as  platforms,  vehicles,  gearboxes,  engines  and  other components);\n- principles of financial policy, including: P\n- discount  rates  used  for  profitability  studies  and  hurdle  rates, P applicable to future models and investments,\n- risk management rules and the policy applicable to them, P\n- financing and cash management rules, P\n- debt leverage strategy; P\n- management  of  common  subsidiaries, and the creation, P modification, steering and disbandment of Cross-Company Teams (CCTs) and Functional Task Teams (FTTs). These teams operate in all  the  main  sectors  and  areas  of  activity  and  are  tasked  with exploring  new  synergies  between  the  two  companies.  Team managers report regularly to the Alliance Board on the progress made in their specific area of activity; and\n- any other subject or project assigned to RNBV on a joint basis by P Nissan and Renault.",

Both manufacturers remain free to follow those proposals or not.\n\nThese proposals relate to:\n\n- creation and scope of joint subsidiaries; P\n- supplementary financial incentive schemes for management; P\n- significant changes in scope involving total amounts  of P $100 million or more;\n- strategic investments exceeding $500 million; and P\n- strategic  cooperations  between  Nissan  or  Renault  and  third P parties.\n\n## Governance of RNBV\n\nThe functioning of the Management Board of RNBV is described in Articles 14 et seq . of the RNBV articles of association.\n\nA French translation of the RNBV articles of association is available on the Renault website.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Management  Board  of  RNBV  has  always followed a principle of balance in the representation of Renault and Nissan. In practice, decisions and recommendations from RNBV are always made by consensus between the two shareholders.\n\nPursuant  to  the  RNBV  articles  of  association  and  the  RAMA,  the Management Board comprises 10 members:\n\n- five  members  are  appointed  by  Renault,  the  'R  Members', P including Renault's Chief Executive Officer who holds the title of 'Chairman and CEO' , i.e. ,  Chairman of the Management Board of RNBV;\n- five  members  are  appointed  by  Nissan,  the  'N  Members', P including  Nissan's  Chief  Executive  Officer  who  holds  the  title  of \"Vice-Chairman\" , i.e. , Vice-Chairman of the Management Board.\n\nThe Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the Management Board of RNBV  have  four  votes  each,  and  the  other  members  of  the Management Board have one vote each. In the event of a tie,  the Chairman has a casting vote.\n\nAll decisions of the Management Board are made by simple majority of the votes of the members present or represented.\n\nTHE ALLIANCE\n\nPursuant  to  the  RNBV  articles  of  association,  the  Management Board  has  the  power  to  represent  RNBV vis-\u00e0-vis third  parties. Likewise, the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman each have the power to represent RNBV vis-\u00e0-vis third parties.\n\nAll decisions affecting the Alliance are made in the common interest of  Renault  and  of  Nissan.  In  the  event  that  a  member  of  the Management  Board  finds  itself  in  a  situation  where  there  is  a conflict  of  interest  in  the  decision-making  process,  he  or  she  shall abstain from taking part in the decision.\n\nThe decisions and recommendations initiated by RNBV are prepared by Renault and Nissan managers. They reflect the common position of the Alliance partners in strategic and planning matters, within the Alliance.\n\nRenault  representatives  within  RNBV,  as  well  as  Renault's management  and  administrative  bodies,  ensure  that  all  decisions initiated by RNBV are made in compliance with Renault's corporate interest.\n\nIn  addition,  RNBV's  decisions  and  recommendations are submitted to  the  management  and  administrative  bodies  of  Renault,  which ensure their compliance with Renault's corporate interest. Thus, no strategic  option  with  regard  to  Renault,  including  under  powers delegated to RNBV, is taken without Renault executives or Board of Directors, depending on circumstances, having expressed an opinion.\n\nAs part of this review, the members of Renault's Board of Directors, including  its  independent  members,  have  all  the  information  they need on the questions submitted to them.\n\nThe implementation of the orientations defined by RNBV and all of the  resulting  operational  decisions  remain  within  the  exclusive competence  of  Renault,  which  is  represented  by  its  Board  of Directors and the executives authorized to represent the Company.\n\nBeyond  the  areas  falling  within  RNBV's  competence,  Renault  is entirely free to conduct its activities, and all decisions relating to the operational,  commercial,  financial  and  social  management  of  the company  are  made  by  its  management  and  administrative  bodies acting autonomously and independently.\n\nI",

These strategic cooperations make it possible to increase economies of scale, accelerate growth in new regions, gain access to new  technologies,  share  costs  and  jointly  fund  research  and development of next-generation vehicles and engines. Existing and potential partners of the Alliance especially appreciate its ability to deepen collaboration over several business cycles.\n\nThe  Alliance's  most  significant  strategic  collaboration  is  by  far  the one  with  the  premium  manufacturer  Daimler.  This  partnership began  in  April  2010.  This  strategic  cooperation  is  strengthened  by cross-shareholdings:  Daimler  holds  3.1%  of  Renault's  and  Nissan's share capital, while Renault and Nissan each hold 1.55% of Daimler's share capital.\n\nThis co-operation  is  managed  by  a  Cooperation  Committee co-chaired by Mr Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Alliance Operating  Board,  and  Mr  Ola  Kaellenius,  Chairman  of  the Management Board of Daimler AG and CEO of Mercedes-Benz AG, comprises  the  senior  executives  of  Renault,  Nissan,  Mitsubishi Motors  and  Daimler.  This  committee,  which  meets  nearly  every month,  ensures  the  implementation  of  the  agreed  projects  and makes  proposals  for  new  ones.  No  specific  areas  of  potential collaboration are excluded. When teams suggest projects that could benefit  all  partners,  they  then  launch  feasibility  studies.  If  senior executives  and  Board  members  of  all  companies  agree,  then  the project is approved.\n\nIn 2018, Mitsubishi Motors was fully integrated into the cooperation with Daimler.\n\nThe  cooperation  between  the  Alliance  and  Daimler  now  covers projects  developed  on  three  continents.  The  key  projects  in  which Renault is currently participating are as follows:\n\n- in addition to the thermal versions of the TWINGO and SMART, an P electric  version  of  the  SMART  2-  and  4-seater  was  launched  in 2017,  and  an  electric  version  of  the  TWINGO  was  launched  in 2020. The electric engines are being built at the Renault plant in Cl\u00e9on. The battery of the electric SMART is produced by a Daimler subsidiary,  Deutsche  ACCUmotive,  in  Kamenz,  Germany,  and  the TWINGO battery is produced in Novo Mesto (Slovenia);\n- Renault  developed  a  small  light  commercial  vehicle  based  on P KANGOO for Daimler. This vehicle has been manufactured in the Renault Maubeuge plant since 2012. The successors of KANGOO and  CITAN  are  currently  under  development  in  both  ICE  and electric versions;\n- Renault continues to supply Daimler with engines and gearboxes, P including  a  1.7-liter  diesel  version  for  certain  Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles;\n- the  Alliance  and  Daimler  AG  have  jointly  developed  a  new P direct-injection turbocharged small gasoline engine family (1l and 1.3l).  These  new,  more  compact engines feature state-of-the-art technology  enabling  improvements  in  fuel  economy,  as  well  as significant  reductions  in  emissions.  The  new  engines  debuted  in Daimler, Renault and Nissan vehicles in late 2017.\n\n## Value of joint operations in 2020 1.2.4.1\n\nGroupe  Renault  made  purchases  from  Nissan  in  2020  for  approximately  \u20ac1,361  million  (\u20ac1,896  million  in  2019),  comprising  around \u20ac1,000 million in vehicles (\u20ac1,046 million in 2019), \u20ac277 million in components (\u20ac655 million in 2019), and \u20ac84 million in miscellaneous services (\u20ac195 million in 2019) (see note 12 J of the Renault consolidated financial statements).\n\nI",

After a first half  of  2020  in  which  the  Group's  main  markets  were  severely impacted  by  the  pandemic  and  the  associated  containment measures,  the  second  half  of  the  year  shows  greater  resilience: Group sales in Europe remained in line with the markets.\n\nOn  the  European  electric  market,  the  Renault  brand  doubled  its sales  and  confirmed  its  leadership  with  116,196  electric  vehicles sold.  ZOE  is  the  best-selling  electric  car  with  114%  growth  at 100,815 units.\n\nGroupe  Renault  achieved  its  CAFE  targets (1) (passenger  cars  and light commercial vehicles) in Europe.\n\nGroup  revenues reached  \u20ac43,474 million  (-21.7%).  At  constant exchange rates, the decrease would have been -18.2%.\n\nAutomotive excluding AVTOVAZ revenues stood at \u20ac37,736 million, down -23.0%.\n\nThe volume effect was -19.2 points. It stemmed primarily from the health  crisis  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  from  our  commercial  policy favoring profit over volume.\n\nForex  impact  was  negative  -2.8 points,  and  related  to  the devaluation of the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real and Turkish lira and to a lesser extent to the Russian rubble.\n\nPrice effect, up 3.9 points, came from a more ambitious price policy and  measures  to  mitigate  devaluations.  Product  mix  impacted  for 1.1 points thanks to ZOE sales increase.\n\nEffect  'others'  weighed  for  -1 point,  notably  because  of  lower contribution  from  spare  parts  activity,  largely  impacted  by  the confinement measures in H1.\n\nThe Group's  operating  margin amounted  to  -\u20ac337 million  and represented -0.8% of revenues (4.8% in 2019) thanks to a marked improvement in H2 (3.5% of revenues).\n\nAutomotive  excluding  AVTOVAZ  operating  margin was  down -\u20ac2,734 million  to  -\u20ac1,450 million,  which  represented  -3.8%  of revenues  compared  to  +2.6%  in  2019.  In  the  second  half,  it  was positive at \u20ac198 million (0.9% of revenues).\n\nThe change can be explained by the following:\n\n- volume effect had a negative impact of -\u20ac2,556 million, including P sales to partners;\n- mix/price/enrichment  effect  was  positive  +\u20ac172 million  despite P the enrichment of new products and the regulatory content;\n\nSales to partners declined by -5.1 points, also impacted by the health crisis and the Nissan ROGUE production discontinuation.\n\n- CAFE: Corporate Average Fuel Economy. These results should be consolidated and formalized by the European Commission in the coming (1) months.",

This decrease was due to a lower activity, with new financings down -17% and a cost of risk representing  0.75%  of  average  performing  assets  compared  to 0.42% last year.\n\nThe contribution  of  Mobility  Services  to  the  Group's  operating margin amounted to -\u20ac35 million in 2020.\n\nOther operating income and expenses amounted to -\u20ac1,662 million (compared to -\u20ac557 million in 2019) coming from significantly higher restructuring charges and impairments.\n\nGroup  operating  income came  to  -\u20ac1,999 million  compared  with \u20ac2,105 million in 2019 after taking into account a strong increase of charges related to competitiveness improvement.\n\nNet  financial  income  and  expenses amounted  to  -\u20ac482 million, compared  with  -\u20ac442 million  in  2019,  due  to  higher  average indebtedness.\n\nThe contribution of associated companies came to -\u20ac5,145 million, compared  with  -\u20ac190 million  in  2019.  Nissan's  contribution  was negative  at  -\u20ac4,970 million  and  the  one  of  other  companies amounted to -\u20ac175 million.\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  taxes represented  a  charge  of  -\u20ac420 million compared to a charge of -\u20ac1,454 million in 2019.\n\nNet income stood  at  -\u20ac8,046 million and net income, Group share totaled -\u20ac8,008 million (-\u20ac29.51 per share compared with \u20ac0.52 per share in 2019).\n\nAutomotive  operational  free  cash  flow,  including  AVTOVAZ ,  was negative at -\u20ac4,551 million. It takes into account the fall in operating margin, the change in working capital requirements and the absence of  dividend  received  from  RCI  following  European  Central  Bank's decisions. On the sole second half, the free cash flow was positive at +\u20ac1,824 million due to investment management and a reverse of the change in working capital requirement, without, however, offsetting the change in the first half of the year.\n\nThe Automotive net cash position was negative at -\u20ac3,579 million at December 31,  2020  compared  with  a  positive  position  of \u20ac1,734 million at December 31, 2019.\n\nThe Automotive activity at December 31, 2020 held +\u20ac16.4 billion of liquidity reserves .\n\nAt  December 31,  2020, total  inventories (including  independent dealers)  represented  486,000  vehicles,  down  more  than  100,000 units (-19%). It represented 61 days of sales, compared to 68 days at end-December 2019.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  propose  at  the  Shareholders'  Annual General Meeting, scheduled for April 23, 2021, not to pay a dividend in respect of 2020.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe electronic chip shortage impacting the whole auto industry does not  spare  the  Group.  It  is  entirely  dedicated  to  limit  as  much  as possible the impact on production. The peak of the shortage should be reached in Q2. The most recent estimate, assuming a production catch-up in H2, gives a net risk of about 100,000 vehicles for the year 2021.\n\nIn accordance with the Renaulution plan, the Group will continue the implementation of the actions aiming at its recovery and confirms the 2023 objectives communicated during the plan presentation:\n\n- Group operating margin above 3% by 2023; P\n- cumulative  automotive  operational  free  cash  flow (1) (2021-2023) P about \u20ac3 billion;\n- investments (R&D and capex) at about 8% of revenues by 2023.

The brand is thus establishing itself on the market for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles with more than 30,000 sales in Europe, representing 25% of order volumes for these vehicles.\n\nDuring  the  first  half  of  2021,  the  E-TECH  range  will  be  expanded with  the  arrival  of  the  Renault  ARKANA  E-TECH  hybrid,  CAPTUR E-TECH hybrid and MEGANE Sedan E-TECH plug-in hybrid.\n\n## In Europe\n\nGroup sales totaled 1,445,354 units, down 25.7% in a market down 23.5%.\n\nThe Renault brand  slightly  increased  its  market  share  to  7.7%,  up 0.1 points, thanks to the successful renewal of its B segment models (CLIO,  CAPTUR and ZOE) and the successful launch of the E-TECH range.\n\nCLIO  is  the  best-selling  vehicle  in  its  category in  Europe  with 227,106  units  sold.  The  Renault  brand  thus  increased  its  share  of sales in the retail market by nearly one point.\n\nThe Dacia brand recorded a 31.7% drop in sales to 385,944 vehicles sold.  The  SANDERO  remains  for  the  fourth consecutive  year  the best-selling  vehicle  within  the  retail  market.  Two  of  the  brand's historic  models,  the  New  SANDERO  and  New  SANDERO  Stepway, have been available since the end of 2020.\n\nDacia's new dual-fuel petrol and LPG engines, which are offered on the majority of its range under the ECO-G name, account for more than 25% of its vehicle sales in Europe.\n\n## Outside Europe\n\nGroup sales were down 16.5%, mainly due to a 45% decline in sales in Brazil as a result of the reorientation towards the most profitable channels.\n\nIn Russia ,  the  Group's  second-largest  country  in  terms  of  sales volume, Groupe Renault is the leader with a market share of 30.1%, up 1.2 points. Sales fell 5.5% in a market down 9.2%.\n\nLADA confirmed  its  position  as  the  leading  brand  in  the  Russian market with 21.5% market share.

In  the  second  half,  it  was positive at \u20ac198 million (0.9% of revenues).\n\nThe change can be explained by the following:\n\n- volume effect had a negative impact of -\u20ac2,556 million, including P sales to partners;\n- mix/price/enrichment  effect  was  positive  +\u20ac172 million  despite P the enrichment of new products and the regulatory content;\n- the  Monozukuri  effect  was  positive  by  +\u20ac36 million  after  taking P into  account  a  negative  impact  of  -\u20ac479 million  due  to  the increase  in  depreciation  and  amortization  and  a  lower  R&D capitalization rate;\n- raw materials weighed for -\u20ac131 million largely on higher prices P for precious metals;\n- the  improvement  of  +\u20ac172 million  of  G&A  spending  stemmed P from  the  impact  of  lower  activity  in  H1  but  also  from  the company's effort to limit its costs under the \"2o22 plan\";\n- currencies impacted by -\u20ac428 million reflecting the devaluation of P our main currencies despite the positive impact of the Turkish lira on production costs.\n\nThe AVTOVAZ  operating  margin  contribution amounted  to \u20ac141 million,  compared  to  \u20ac155 million  in  2019,  highlighting  the resilience of AVTOVAZ in the COVID-19 context.\n\nSales Financing contributed \u20ac1,007 million to the Group's operating  margin , compared  to  \u20ac1,223 million  in  2019.  This decrease  was  due  to  a  lower  activity,  with  new  financings  down -17% and a cost of risk representing 0.75% of average performing assets compared to 0.42% last year.\n\nThe contribution  of  Mobility  Services to  the  Group's  operating margin amounted to -\u20ac35 million in 2020.\n\nOther operating income and expenses amounted to -\u20ac1,662 million (compared to -\u20ac557 million in 2019) coming from significantly higher restructuring charges and impairments.\n\nGroup  operating  income came  to  -\u20ac1,999 million  compared  with \u20ac2,105 million in 2019 after taking into account a strong increase of related to measures taken to improve competitiveness.\n\nNet  financial  income  and  expenses amounted  to  -\u20ac482 million, compared  with  -\u20ac442 million  in  2019,  due  to  higher  average indebtedness.\n\nThe contribution of associated companies came to -\u20ac5,145 million, compared  with  -\u20ac190 million  in  2019.  Nissan's  contribution  was negative  at  -\u20ac4,970 million  and  the  one  of  other  companies amounted to -\u20ac175 million.\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  taxes represented  a  charge  of  -\u20ac420 million compared to a charge of -\u20ac1,454 million in 2019.\n\nNet income stood  at  -\u20ac8,046 million and net income, Group share totaled -\u20ac8,008 million (-\u20ac29.51 per share compared with \u20ac0.52 per share in 2019).\n\nI",

The  lower  level  of capitalized development expenses is notably attributable to deferral of  certain  technical  milestones  from  which  development  expenses are capitalized.\n\nAmortization was substantially higher in 2020 than 2019, due to the higher  level  of  capitalized  development  expenses  in  2018  and particularly in 2019.\n\n## NET CAPEX AND R&D EXPENSES IN % OF REVENUES\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                                                                                           | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Tangible investments net of disposals (excluding capitalized leased vehicles and batteries) and intangible  (excluding capitalized development costs) | 2,631  | 3,006  |\n| CAPEX invoiced to third parties and others                                                                                                            | -83    | -213   |\n| Net industrial and commercial investments excl.

The  development  of  autonomous  cars  and shuttles  will  accelerate  the  growth  of  electric,  autonomous  and shared mobility services, which in turn will promote multimodality complementarity  between  modes  of  transport  -  and  make  the overall system cleaner, safer, easier, more accessible, more effective and  more  efficient.  The  car  is  already  electric  and  connected; tomorrow it could also be autonomous in specific use cases, with the benefit of smoother, more seamless driving and improved safety.\n\nFrom 2017 and into 2020, Groupe Renault, together with public and private partners, has been testing electric, autonomous and shared mobility  services  delivered  by  autonomous  Renault  ZOE  Cab prototypes:\n\n- TORNADO project in Rambouillet: testing of autonomous driving P solutions,  technologies  and  infrastructure  in  sparsely  populated areas.  Testing  took  place  along  a  13km  route  providing  a  direct link between Gazeran train station and the Bel Air business park in Rambouillet, representative of the specificities of peri-urban and rural areas;\n- Rouen Normandy Autonomous Lab: first testing in Europe of an P autonomous,  shared  and  on-demand  mobility  service  on  open roads, as an extension to the existing public transport service. The tests were carried out on three routes serving different stopping points throughout the Technop\u00f4le du Madrillet district;\n- Paris-Saclay  Autonomous  Lab:  testing  of  services  for  smarter, P electric, autonomous, shared and on-demand mobility in addition to  the  modes  of  transport  already  present  on  the  Paris-Saclay campus. The aim was to test a point-to-point mobility service for everyday travel on the Paris-Saclay urban site. Groupe Renault is continuing  its research  into  autonomous  mobility,  and  is participating, via the SAM (Safety and Acceptability of Driving and Autonomous  Mobility)  consortium  coordinated  by  the  French Automotive Platform (PFA);\n- to  the  EVRA Project (autonomous road vehicle experimentation) P launched by ADEME as part of the Future Investments Program\n\n(PIA), a key part of the national strategy for the development of autonomous  vehicles.  Its  objective  is  to  contribute  to  the development  of  safety  validation  methodologies,  to  improve knowledge  on  uses,  acceptability  and  societal  impacts.  The Group's work will consist notably in testing on-demand, electric, autonomous  and  shared  car  services,  such  as  collective  public transport  and  private  public  transport,  in  the  Rouen  city  center and at Paris-Saclay.\n\nIn June 2019, Groupe Renault, Nissan Motor Co. and Waymo signed an exclusive agreement for an initial phase of exploration covering all  aspects  of  autonomous  mobility  services  for  the  transport  of people  and  the  delivery  of  goods  in  France  and  Japan.  The agreement brings together the strengths of the three partners and extends  their expertise through  the  assessment  of  market opportunities and joint research on commercial, legal and regulatory issues related to mobility service offers in France and Japan.\n\nVehicles  are  increasingly  connected  to  the  world  around  them.  In 2019 and 2020, several projects combining connectivity and electric vehicles were begun.\n\n## RENAULT EZ-FLEX, the experimental, electric, connected and modular light commercial vehicle\n\nConceived  and  designed  for  urban  deliveries,  it  analyzes  data supplemented  by  feedback  from  business  professionals  to  better understand urban delivery needs on a daily basis. It is 100% electric for  sustainable  mobility  with  a  range  of  150km.  It  is  a  compact vehicle  with  an  excellent  load  volume/length  ratio  thanks  to  a compact cabin, designed to make it easier for drivers to get in and out of the vehicle frequently. Exceptional maneuverability: a turning radius of 4.5m. Designed for the different ways customers want to use  vehicles,  it  can  be  tailor-made,  with  an  interchangeable  rear module.  Innovative,  it  has  a  new  smartphone-inspired  Human Machine Interface (HMI). Connected, the HMI offers vehicle-related services and  can  embed  applications  designed  for  different professional activities.",

The  fleet  of  10  vehicles  was  launched,  and  a number  of  functional  developments  have  been  made  to  adapt  to different  uses.  After  Greater  Montpellier  and  La  Poste  in  the  Paris region,  several  companies  of  all  sizes  and  in  various  sectors  have expressed an interest in testing the vehicle in 2021.\n\n## TORNADO PROJECT: autonomous mobility services in rural areas.\n\nThe  aim  of  the  TORNADO  project  is  to  define  and  test  the technologies and conditions necessary for the roll-out of autonomous  mobility  services  in  low-density  areas.  Launched  in September 2017 and running for 36 months (until November 2020), the TORNADO project explored different use cases aimed at meeting the needs of rural areas.\n\nLed by Groupe Renault and co-managed by Rambouillet Territoires, this research project was  carried out in conjunction with approximately  10  industrial  and  academic  partners.  Autonomous mobility  is  not  a  challenge  reserved  for  large  cities.  Autonomous vehicle  trials  must  take  into  account  the  specificities  of  sparsely populated  areas  where  transport  solutions  are  often  scarce,  with many rural areas facing specific challenges. The TORNADO research project,  which  ends  today,  accordingly  aimed  to  identify  the technologies  and  communication  infrastructure  necessary  for  the roll-out  of  autonomous  mobility  services  in  rural  and  peri-urban areas,  through two use cases and thanks to collaboration between industrial and academic partners, a region and local populations.\n\nIn this context, two electric and autonomous mobility services were tested,  with  validation  periods  in  the  field  on  a  real  scale  and environment:\n\n- an  on-demand  shared  vehicle  service  (Renault  ZOE)  directly P connecting  the  Gazeran  rural  train  station  and  the  Bel  Air:  La For\u00eat business park in Rambouillet;\n- another via a shuttle service with stopping points within the Bel P Air business park.\n\nThe  technical  component  of  the  TORNADO  project  consisted  in defining  and  developing  autonomous  driving  solutions  as  well  as communication technologies and infrastructure:\n\n- that  ensure  a  maximum  level  of  safety:  hardware,  software, P on-board and remote solutions, vehicle-infrastructure communication, etc. ;\n- that  adapt  to  the  specificities  of  peri-urban  and  rural  areas: P narrow  roads,  roundabouts,  obstacles  blocking  visibility,  lack  of road markings or landmarks, heterogeneity of road edges, narrow tunnels with a single lane, etc .\n\nFor  Groupe  Renault,  the  challenge  was  to  run  an  electric  vehicle completely  autonomously  over  a  distance  of  13km,  in  a  direct  link between the Gazeran train station and the Bel Air business park in Rambouillet, representative of these specific features. The\n\nI\n\ncomplexity and diversity of traffic scenarios in rural and peri-urban environments required it, among other things:\n\n- to  increase  the  perception  capabilities  of  autonomous  vehicles P with real-time 360-degree detection of the environment (type of objects, size, distance from the vehicle);\n- to be able to locate and control the autonomous vehicle to within P 20 centimeters to ensure that it stays in its lane, on roads that can be very narrow, regardless of the shoulder;\n- to  make  up  for  temporary  loss  of  GPS  signal  or  total  lack  of P visibility, such as when passing through a single-lane tunnel;\n- to  achieve,  in  autonomous  mode,  'acceptable'  speed  levels  as P close as possible to the reality of passengers and other road users, namely up to 70 km/h.\n\nOn  this  route,  project  partners  were  able  to  test  the  role  of connected  infrastructure  elements  (connected  lights  and  fixed cameras enabling vehicles to take into account objects beyond their own perception).\n\n## Simulation tools for autonomous vehicles\n\n## ELID 2 : exploring new uses for autonomous vehicles\n\nTo  invent  the  cockpits  of  the  autonomous  vehicles  of  the  future, Renault has been using a new research tool: ELID 2 (Experience Life in Delegation), an innovative, customizable demonstrator.\n\nBased  on  the  design  of  an  ESPACE V  cockpit,  ELID 2 looks  like  the front part of a vehicle and is coupled with a simulator to represent an autonomous driving situation. Everything has been designed so that while in the demo car, the driver or front-seat passenger feels like  he/she is in a self-driving vehicle on the road and can perform normal activities  in  the  car.  This  means  that  if  the  driver  wants  to relax and watch a movie, the seat can recline and a screen rise from the dashboard. They can also share their film with the passenger or choose other activities such as writing emails or surfing the Internet.\n\nELID 2 can be fully customized. All of its features (dashboard, screens, steering wheel, seats, etc .)  can be changed easily. The demo model will  thus  be  able  to  evolve  over  the  next  few  years  and  take  into account new areas of research or technological development.\n\nThis  research  tool  is  used  by  ergonomists  to  test  cockpit  solutions and  study  the  behavior  of  occupants  during  the  main  phases  of autonomous driving:  activation  of  autonomous  mode,  autonomous driving, and resumption of manual driving.\n\n## Renault R-NEST: using stimulation to fight hypovigilance at the wheel\n\nThe Renault R-NEST project (Renault Research Tool for NEuroscience  STudies)  was  developed  by  the  Groupe  Renault Research department as a neurophysiology research tool and demo model for these types of system. The purpose of this research is to help reduce accidents caused by driving fatigue.",

It  has  two cameras (3D and 2D) that capture and record driver reactions  and measure  a  large  amount  of  data  (heart  rate,  head  position  and movement, etc .).  Analysis of these parameters makes it possible to determine  the  driver's  overall  condition,  by  recognizing  his  or  her state of alertness, for example.\n\nIf  hypovigilance  is  detected,  Renault  R-NEST  acts  to  protect  driver and  user  safety  whether  or  not  the  car  is  in  motion  by  offering reactivation or relaxation scenarios. For example, when driving, the system will inform the driver and offer him or her countermeasures such  as  music  containing  'infrasounds',  which  have  the  effect  of reactivating concentration, giving the driver time to park safely in a parking lot and thus avoid an accident by falling asleep at the wheel. The aim is to determine the effectiveness of these methods, which are still at a very early stage (research), to decide whether or not to continue to the R&D phase.\n\nThe  benefits  could  be  physiological  (the  brain  is  more  'awake'), behavioral  (subject  reaction  rates  are  higher)  and  subjective  (the driver feels less tired).\n\n## AD-learning: The driver at the heart of the learning process for new driving styles\n\nDriving  aids  (ADAS)  are  already  a  reality  in  the  Renault  range (adaptive  driving  control,  parking  aid,  lane  keeping  aid, etc .).  Their development  will  continue  in  the  future,  leading  gradually  to autonomous  driving  functions.  This  arsenal  of  technologies  makes driving both more enjoyable and safer. But to take full advantage of all the new functions, drivers must be comfortable with their use and fully understand how they work.\n\nTo  this  end,  and  with  the  customer  always  at  the  heart  of  its concerns, Renault has for several years been developing a program called 'AD Learning', which aims to develop a battery of educational tools, from simple videos to driving simulators, to put customers in a learning  situation.  This  program  is  being  developed  in  partnership with the company's sales functions, which are in direct contact with customers.\n\nFor example, a demonstrator was placed in a large dealership in the Paris  region  for  several  weeks  in  order  to  collect  the  opinions  and suggestions of sales staff and customers in the field. This research program will be continued in the years to come, as this is a key point in the roll-out and effectiveness of driving aids.\n\n## Research into electric vehicles (EVs)\n\nWith a 10-year lead over most of its competitors, Groupe Renault is both a pioneer in electric mobility and the leader in Europe. This is the result of continuous work by the Group's teams to maintain this lead at a time when competitors are making inroads in the field, thus affirming the electric vehicle as a strategic choice. Our four priorities in this competition are:\n\n- continually enriching our offer by expanding our current range of P five  vehicles  and  introducing  new  products  to  reach  eight  100% electric vehicles by 2022;\n- increasing battery range: technology in this area is advancing at a P rapid rate. The marketing of the new ZOE at the end of 2016 with\n\nits 400km NEDC range and the Renault Medium-Term Plan, with its projected range of greater than 600km in 2022, are examples of this. Nevertheless, the choice of autonomous cars by customers will  increasingly  become  a  rational  choice  that  will  have  to  be covered  with  several  different  levels  based  on  budgets  and customer driving profiles;\n\n- making  EV  technology  more  competitive:  this  involves  both P reducing the cost of batteries and reducing the cost of electronic power  components,  which  will  be  less  expensive  and  less  bulky while  still  performing  better.  The  Renault  Medium-Term  Plan, with its projected reduction of 30% on the cost of batteries and 20% on the cost of electronic power components, is an example of this;\n- developing  technologies  to  make  battery  charging  easier  and P more efficient: the improvement of battery chargeability and the development/standardization of so-called 'fast' chargers will be a key factor for the electric vehicles of the future. Research is also being carried out on inductive charging (static and dynamic) and robotic  charging,  which  could  allow  users  to  recharge  their  EV batteries without having to connect an electric cable to a charger.\n\n## Contactless dynamic charge: inductive electric charging on the go\n\nRenault is  working  on  a  dynamic  inductive  charging  project,  which will  allow  the  batteries  in  its  electric  vehicles  to  be  charged  while driving.\n\nCoils  of  conductive  materials  (copper,  aluminum, etc .)  are  inserted into the road. Powered by an alternating current, these loops emit a magnetic field that is captured by a receiving loop located under the car.  When  the  vehicle  passes  over  a  coil  beneath  the  road,  the electromagnetic  field  creates  an  inductive  electric  current  in  the receiver coil. This inductive current is used either directly for traction or to recharge the battery. In this way, the road supplies the car with energy while driving.\n\nDriving  over  the  coils  would  keep  electric  vehicles  charged permanently and automatically. The energy can either be used for driving,  in  all  or  part,  or  to  charge  the  battery.  The  energy transmitted to the vehicle is proportional to the time spent driving on the equipped part of the road.\n\nA stretch of test road has been developed with loops and an artificial sidewalk that conceals the electronic equipment required. Each coil is  managed  separately  and  can  transfer  the  energy  needed  to  the vehicle.  In  this  experiment,  the  test  vehicle  is  a  TWIZY,  which receives 2 kW on a continuous basis. This is the first stage.\n\n## INCIT-EV, an ambitious European research project on electric vehicle charging launched in early 2020 and coordinated by Renault\n\nAfter  conducting  several  research  projects  aimed  at  developing innovative load concepts, such as induction charging while driving, Groupe Renault launched the European INCIT-EV project in 2020, in conjunction  with  32  partners  across  Europe.  The  INCIT-EV  project will  run  for  48  months,  from  January  2020  to  December  2023,  and will be divided into two main phases:\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n- a phase of study of consumer needs and constraints, which, from P April 2020, will be followed by the study of charging technologies and their integration into infrastructure;\n- a phase of on-site demonstration of seven technologies from the P second half of 2022 until the end of the project;\n- a  dynamic  induction  charging  system  in  urban  areas  in  Paris, P France,\n- high-power  charging  systems  on  the  outskirts  of  Tallinn  in P Estonia,\n- optimized  bi-directional  smart  charging  in  Amsterdam  and P Utrecht in the Netherlands,\n- a dynamic induction charging system in peri-urban/long-range P areas in Versailles in France,\n- a  charging  hub  in  a  car-sharing  car  park  on  the  outskirts  of P Turin in Italy,\n- bi-directional low-power charging (including two-wheelers) and P static  induction  charging  in  taxiways  at  Zaragoza  airport  and central railway station in Spain.\n\nIn view of the need to test charging technologies in real conditions and to structure the ecosystem as a whole, Groupe Renault was keen to  take  part  in  a  call  for  projects  from  the  European  Commission. Within  that  framework,  the  Group  worked  to  create  a  consortium. Some  30  carmakers,  universities,  institutes,  cities,  start-ups  and SMEs responded positively to the initiative, with a shared desire to promote  electromobility  in  Europe  through  testing  focused  on electric  vehicle  users.  The  approach  is  highly  customer-centric  and will make it possible to build a new ecosystem and design charging technologies  that  can  be  easily  rolled  out  to  encourage  the development of electromobility in Europe. The INCIT-EV project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and  innovation  program  under  grant  agreement  no.  875683.  The INCIT-EV  project  consortium  was  initiated  and  coordinated  by Groupe  Renault.  In  this  capacity,  Groupe  Renault  serves  as  the interface  between  the  European  Commission  and  all  partners, overseeing technical development, budgets and planning.\n\n## New battery technologies for electric vehicles\n\nAt the end of 2018, Alliance Ventures, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi venture  capital  fund,  announced  its  participation  in  the  last financing round by Enevate Corporation. Based in Irvine (California), this company specializes in the design of lithium-ion batteries. This is  the  latest  investment  by  Alliance  Ventures,  which  was  launched this year to support the most innovative start-ups in next-generation systems  for  the  automotive  industry.  The  silicon-dominated lithium-ion batteries developed by Enevate offer ultra-fast charging capabilities  and  high  energy density, at  a  reduced cost. They could potentially  offer  the  shortest  charging  time  out  of  all  of  the lithium-ion battery technologies currently available on the market.\n\nAlliance  Ventures  has  also  invested  in  Ionic  Materials,  a  promising US company that is developing a polymer material whose properties could contribute to the development of so-called 'solid state' cells. This  investment  coincides  with  the  implementation  of  a  research\n\nI\n\nand  development  cooperation  agreement  between  Ionic  Materials and  the  Alliance.  Based  in  Massachusetts,  Ionic  Materials  is developing a polymer material that can be used as a substitute for the  liquid  electrolyte  in  'traditional'  Li-ion  cells  and  thus  help improve  the  performance  and  economic  efficiency  of  high-energy density batteries for automotive and many other applications.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nReinventing  the  automobile  for  the  twenty-first  century:  a low-energy  consumption  vehicle,  considerably  lighter  weight, connected and able to substitute in all or part for  driver  activities; this  is  a  challenge  that  can  only  be  met  collectively.  For  Renault, collaborative  R&D  agreements  contribute  to  accelerating  the development of the technologies required to meet these challenges, and also to developing skills and cost-sharing. Such contracts are key to speeding up the introduction of innovations into vehicle projects.\n\n## Cooperation\n\nIn  the  competitive  industrial  world,  performance  and  frugality  are indispensable  and  inseparable  to  continue  the  race  at  the  head  of the pack.\n\nTo  open  up  toward  the  outside  world,  to  capture  the  diverse knowledge  and  know-how  of  our  manufacturing  and  academic partners at the highest level, combining these with ours, multiplies our capacity for innovation 10-fold, and enables costs to be shared. This method of collaborative innovation is encouraged by the public financers,  both  French  and  European.  Public  aid,  such  as  subsidies and repayable advances, is an additional lever that helps accelerate our  innovation.  In  this  framework,  Renault  has  always  prioritized cooperative  initiatives  as  part  of  our  R&AE  activities.  These initiatives  are  an  effective  way  of  expanding  our  strategic  plan. Renault's cooperation budget is a multi-year figure of \u20ac180 million and  covers  cooperation  both  in  France  and  Europe.  Cooperation provides  an  opportunity  to  share  costs  and  to  access  financial assistance for faster innovation. Ongoing collaborative projects were awarded  financial  assistance  of  \u20ac2.7 million  in  2020,  broken  down into  \u20ac2.65 million in  subsidies  and  \u20ac85  thousand  in  repayable advances.  In  a  global  health  crisis  characterized  by  extensive telework, some demonstrations and tests had to be postponed, and the level of financial assistance was very exceptionally down in 2020 compared with 2019.\n\n## In 2020\n\nA  portfolio  of  74  subsidized  projects  was  managed  in  2020  using traditional  methods  (36%  of  the  projects  were  more  than  50% funded, with some 10% fully funded by financial backers). A total of 26  French  and  European  projects  were  submitted  over  the  year: 11 were accepted, eight were still being processed and seven were rejected. In addition, projects linked to the national support plan for the  automotive  sector  were  submitted  to  traditional  financing mechanisms. In June 2020 Renault made submissions on:",

They concern the plants in Le Mans (sustainability of the activity and employment of the Chassis industrial site in Le Mans) and Batilly (project to create a battery assembly activity for electric vehicles).\n\nRenault also remains extremely active in its 'Investing in the Future Program'. The projects submitted under the Investing in the Future Programs 1 and 2 are still underway.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## They include:\n\n- EVAPS:  Ecomobility  through  Autonomous  Vehicles  in  the P Paris-Saclay region;\n- HPP: High-Pressure Pulsed; P\n- COCTEL: development of a hybrid powertrain; P\n- the large-scale project (SAM - Safety and Acceptability of Driving P and Autonomous Mobility: design of high-performance automated systems, functionally safe for autonomous vehicles) on autonomous vehicles, submitted as part of PIA 2, began testing as initially planned, but nevertheless suffered some postponements due to the impossibility of carrying out certain tests in view of the health  crisis.  Renault's  research  costs  were  \u20ac42  million  over  the project period, while \u20ac11 million in French State aid was awarded by ADEME for budgeted activities;\n- in  addition,  an  ANR  project  from  academics  was  submitted  and P accepted in 2020, with Renault's participation.

These projects primarily cover batteries, autonomous vehicles, safety, connectivity, materials and processes.\n\nThe following projects attracted the largest subsidies in 2020:\n\n## Name of the project Description\n\n| COLLABS   | Artificial intelligence research - industrial automation on intelligent industrial systems for exchanging information and operating remotely. Cyber  intelligence and cybersecurity in the context of Industry 4.0.   |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| FLEXAMEP  | Production of quickly reconfigurable, easily adaptable and flexible elastomer parts.                                                                                                                                  |\n| Hi-DRIVE  | Test and demonstrate the functionality of highly automated vehicles in demanding traffic scenarios. Ability to interact securely with other traffic  participants.                                                    |\n| INTERQ    | New industry 4.0 technology solution for process/product quality control and data reliability.                                                                                                                        |\n\n## 2021 Outlook\n\nCollaborative projects remain a way for Renault and its partners to share  engineering  knowledge.  We  are  therefore  continuing  to develop new collaborative projects in both France and Europe. We forecast  some  \u20ac6  million  in  terms  of  financial  assistance  (for  all French  and  European  programs  combined),  and  \u20ac1  million  in repayable advances.\n\n## The PSA-Renault Research and Study economic interest grouping (EIG)\n\n## Focus on the LAB\n\nThe PSA-RENAULT Research and Study economic interest grouping (a  form  of  cooperative  venture)  houses  the  cooperation  projects between  the  two  manufacturers  in  shared  fields  of  interest. Historically,  the  two  main  lines  of  work  were  related  to  the LAB (created  in  1969)  and  the Groupement Scientifique Moteur (GSM, created  in  1980).  A  third  line  is  housed  in  the  Materials  IRT.  The LAB's  main  areas  of  work  are  the  analysis  of  road  accidents, biomechanics  and  the  study  of  driver  behavior.  The  LAB's  work includes  collaborative  projects  or  European  initiatives  (such  as  the INDID and PEARS projects). It also studies the paradigm shift in road safety  caused  by  the  arrival  of  connected  and/or  autonomous vehicles (AutoConduct project, SAM), as well as critical scenarios in driving databases such as U-Drive and MOOVE. The GSM worked this year to diversify its work into green energies. Studies carried out at the Materials IRT focused on industry's ability to make effective use of recycling channels.\n\n## Focus on the GSM (Groupement Scientifique Moteur)\n\nThe GSM's main areas of work are combustion and post-treatment systems to improve customer consumption and pollutant emissions. More  specifically,  GSM  focuses  its  studies  on  the  analysis  of  fine particles  and  their  consequences  on  the  environment  and  on secondary aerosols.\n\n## Focus on the IRTs\n\nThe  work  carried  out  on  composite  and  metallic  materials  at  the Jules  Vernes  and  M2P  Technological  Research  Institutes  (IRTs)  is also  conducted  jointly  with  the  two  automotive  manufacturers Renault and PSA within the context of this EIG. Various projects are carried out jointly with the two manufacturers and other partners to\n\nI\n\noptimize the costs related to research projects and share knowledge. Subjects covered include vehicle weight and materials resistance.\n\n## Research activities at the most prestigious universities, other universities, the CNRS (French National Scientific Research Center), etc .\n\nRenault  continues  its  research  activities  with  the  academic  world, the most prestigious universities, and other universities.\n\nJoint research activities are mainly carried out as part of subsidized collaborative projects, work conducted within IRTs and ITEs (energy transition  institutes),  and  as  part  of  studies  involving  doctoral students  under  industrial  research  training  agreements  (CIFREs). Renault hosted 95 doctoral students under CIFREs in 2020. A total of 28  new  topics  were  proposed  in  2020.  The  authorization  issued  to Renault  for  the  scientific  validation  of  subjects  by  the  ANRT  since June 2017  makes  it  possible  to  streamline  the  validation  and recruitment  procedures  for  young  doctoral  students.  Activities  to promote the work of doctoral students were initiated in 2018 in the form of presentations within the company of the research conducted by the students.\n\n## Strategic agreement with the CEA\n\nThe two previous agreements (batteries and strategic cooperation) signed in 2010 expired at the end of 2014. The partnership between Renault  and  the  CEA  (French  Atomic  and  Alternative  Energy Commission)  was  renewed  under  a  single  agreement  covering  all vehicle technical areas for a period of five years starting January 1, 2015. It brings together all collaborations between Renault and the CEA under one agreement focused on joint laboratories located on various  CEA  sites  managing  all  CEA  teams  involved  in  Renault projects. An amendment has extended this agreement to the end of 2024.\n\n2020 represented total activity of \u20ac1.3 million and involved research, advanced engineering and business projects relating to such topics as  electrical  and  power  electronics  architecture,  electric  vehicles, second-life  batteries,  the  integration  of  photovoltaic  panels  on  a vehicle  in  our  range,  3D  printing  and  mechatronics  and  quality control of air in our industrial buildings. In addition, in 2020, Renault continued its collaboration with a CEA robotics start-up to improve productivity in our assembly plants.",

These  chairs  make  it possible  to  participate  in  the  definition  of  teaching  programs  from which our employees can then benefit so that the company can be more  efficient  when  it  incorporates  innovations.  They  are  also  a means of building ties and synergies with the other economic and industrial partners that participate in them.\n\nIn return, these chairs allow academic teams to receive support for research programs, create ties with industrial R&D and promote the results of their teams.\n\nThe  Steering  Committee,  which  brings  together  various  company functions,  enables  us  to  support  the  development  of  proposals  for new chairs, prioritize these proposals and regularly ensure the good progress of the programs initiated.\n\nIn 2020, despite the exceptional context of the COVID-19 pandemic, seven  new  chairs  were  announced  and  work  began  successfully  in line with objectives:\n\n- 'Data to maximize valorization' with the Laboratory of Excellence P of the University of Lyon's;\n- 'Real-time  Extended  Reality  (XR)  simulations  4  Industry'  with P Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech's;\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n- 'Futur de l'Industrie et du Travail' with Mines Paritech, Fabrique P de l'Industrie, \u00c9cole de Paris du Management and GRTgaz, Orange and Michelin's;\n- 'Syst\u00e8mes  de  Syst\u00e8mes'.  '\u00c9nergie  &  prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9'  with  Institut P Louis Bachelier, AFD, ADEME, etc .;\n- 'AI for data-driven and self-configurable supply chains' with the P Multidisciplinary Institute in Artificial intelligence of the University of Grenoble;\n- 'Fair & Robust Methods in Machine Learning' with Artificial and P Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute (ANITI);\n- 'New certification  approaches  of  critical  AI  based  systems'  with P ANITI.  The  work  that  had  been  planned  on  the  \"Intercultural Management\" scope with the ESCP were finalized.\n\nThe other chairs active in 2020 dealt with the following subjects:\n\n- cybersecurity; P\n- aerodynamics; P\n- design of usage-oriented urban systems; P\n- automotive distribution and services; P\n- road safety management; P\n- in-car lighting systems; P\n- electrified propulsion performance in vehicles; P\n- operational excellence and managerial innovation; P\n- inclusive and social business; P\n- supply chain of the future. P\n\nWith these new chairs announced in 2020, Renault remains part of the group of economic and industrial players that lead support and participation in research and teaching chairs.\n\n## New products in 2020 and 2021 and their innovations 1.4.2\n\n## New DACIA SANDERO, SANDERO STEPWAY 1) and LOGAN\n\n## A new on-board experience\n\nThe interior has taken a leap forward on all fronts: increased quality of  presentation,  materials,  finish,  assembly,  ergonomics  and  the appearance of new equipment. True to the Dacia promise, the new SANDERO, SANDERO Stepway and LOGAN still offer the best space for money in the market.\n\nSuperior  roominess:  the  new  SANDERO,  SANDERO  Stepway  and LOGAN offer three real adult seats in the back, a fold-down bench seat (depending on the version) and a family trunk. Meanwhile, the SANDERO has a  capacity  of  328  l  (310  l+12  l),  is  equipped  with  a dual-level  floor  (depending  on  the  version)  and  can  be  unlocked remotely via  a  button  on  the  key  or  the  hands-free  card.  The  new\n\nLOGAN offers loading capacity of 528 liters. The roominess is worthy of the high-end segment, with the largest space in the category for the rear passengers' legs. They enjoy up by 42mm more on the new SANDERO and  the  new  LOGAN.  In  terms  of  storage,  capacity  can reach 21 liters (+2.5 l), with space under the central armrest (1.4 l), in the front and rear doors, and on the backs of the front seats.\n\n## More comfort\n\nThe design and shape of the new front seats offer more comfort and support,  notably  with  height-adjustable  headrests.  To  improve driving  position,  the  driver  can  now  adjust  the  seat  height (+/- 35mm),  the  steering  wheel  height  (+/-  2.1\u00b0)  and  depth (+/- 25mm),  and  opt  for  an  individual  or  central  armrest.  The  gear stick  has  been  shortened.  The  steering  is  fully  electrically  powered for  increased  comfort,  particularly  in  tight  turns  and  for  parking (36% less effort than the previous SANDERO).\n\nI",

The  new  equipment  on  the  SANDERO,  SANDERO Stepway and LOGAN matches change in key customer expectations. Whatever  the  level  of  finish,  the  standard  equipment  includes  a smartphone  holder  (movable  in  some  versions),  an  on-board computer screen, cruise control and speed limiting controls on the steering wheel and automatic lights. For better comfort and safety, drivers  can  keep  their  eyes  on  the  road  and  their  hands  on  the steering wheel. New automatic air conditioning with digital display, heated  front  seats  (from  April  2021),  hands-free  card  with  remote opening of the trunk, an electric parking brake, a reversing camera, front and rear parking aids and automatic ignition of the windshield wipers  are  available  as  standard  equipment  or  as  an  option depending  on  the  market.  Finally,  for  the  first  time  at  Dacia,  an electric glass sunroof will be offered on the new SANDERO and the new SANDERO Stepway in 2021.\n\n## Modern equipment for safety\n\nThanks  to  their  modular  CMF-B  platform  and  their  new  electronic architecture,  the  new  SANDERO,  SANDERO  Stepway  and  LOGAN boast latest generation driving aids and safety equipment.\n\n## Gasoline/LPG bi-fuel system with Dacia ECO-G\n\nDacia is the only carmaker to offer a gasoline/LPG bi-fuel system on its entire range of passenger cars under the ECO-G label. The plant integration of this proven technology on the TCe 100 ECO-G engine is a  guarantee  of  safety  and  reliability.  The  duration  of  the manufacturer's  warranty,  the  interval  and  cost  of  maintenance operations and the trunk capacity are identical to those of a gasoline version  (the  LPG  tank  is  located  where  the  spare  wheel  usually goes).  When  running  on  LPG,  the  new  SANDERO  ECO-G  emits  on average  11%  less  CO2  than  an  equivalent  gasoline  engine.  It  also offers a range of more than 1,300km thanks to its two tanks: a 50 l LPG tank (or 40 l of useful capacity because filling is limited to 80% for  safety  reasons),  an  increase  of  eight  liters  on  the  previous generation  of  SANDERO  GP,  and  a  50  l  gasoline  tank.  With  Dacia, LPG  combines  ease  of  use,  driving  pleasure,  reduction  of  CO2 emissions and long range. Depending on the country, a gasoline/LPG bi-fuel  system  benefits  from  incentives  or  tax  reductions  including low  fuel  prices  at  the  pump,  and  no  environmental  penalties  or traffic restrictions.\n\n## Renault KANGOO and EXPRESS 2)\n\nThe KANGOO Van, the innovative van with an athletic and dynamic style, is mainly aimed at demanding fleets, craftspeople and traders looking  for  a  tailor-made  vehicle  equipped  with  the  latest technologies for professionals.\n\nI\n\n## With its major innovation, Easy Side Access and Easy Inside Rack, the KANGOO Van is revolutionizing the way people work.\n\nEasy Side Access: particularly practical in city centers, this innovation gives  customers  easy  access  to  their  load,  regardless  of  parking constraints.

        "page_content": "In  terms  of  powertrain,  the  ARKANA  offers  a  full  hybrid  E-TECH engine  that  systematically  starts  up  with  electric  traction  and ensures  driving  pleasure  at  all  times,  with  clear  and  instant acceleration.  Energy  efficiency  is  also  part  of  the  deal,  thanks  in particular  to  its  innovative  multi-mode  gearbox,  its  efficient regenerative  braking  and  its  high  capacity  for  automatic  battery recharging.  Driving  time  in  cities  is  fully  electric  up  to  80%  of  the time.  That  makes  it  possible  to  limit  CO2  emissions  and  reduce consumption  by  up  to  40%  in  the  urban  cycle  compared  with  a combustion-only engine.\n\nThe ARKANA also offers a four-cylinder gasoline engine with 1.3 TCe direct  injection.  Economical  and  efficient,  it  procures  real  driving pleasure. Combined with EDC dual-clutch automatic transmission, it will  first  be  offered  in  a  140hp  version  and  then  also  in  a  160hp version. New  and  innovative,  the  1.3  TCe  engine  is  now micro-hybridized  with  the  addition  of  a  starter-alternator  system coupled with a 12 V lithium-ion battery  under  the  passenger  seat. This  technology  improves  Stop  &  Start  and  ensures  energy regeneration during deceleration phases. It also assists the engine in the  phases  that  consume  the  most  energy,  namely  starting  and accelerating.  It  thus  reduces  fuel  consumption  and  CO2  emissions while ensuring smoother restarting and better driving comfort.\n\nEquipment-wise, the ARKANA has a high-tech cockpit with a digital display on the instrument panel. The color screen comes in 4.2, 7 or 10.2 inches depending on the version and allows you to personalize your driving experience in a very intuitive way. Complemented by a central  7-  or  9.3-inch  screen,  it  houses  the  EASY  LINK  multimedia system (permanent 4G connectivity, enhanced services, system and mapping always up to date thanks to 'Over The Air' technology and even customization of settings with MULTI-SENSE), which helps give the vehicle one of the largest display surfaces in its category.\n\nThe  ARKANA  also  boasts  a  full  range  of  driving  aids.  Its  latest generation technologies include a 360-degree camera to detect all obstacles  around  the  vehicle,  as  well  as  highway  and  traffic assistants,  combining  adaptive  cruise  control  with  the  stop  &  start function  and  lane  departure  assistance.  This  level-two  autonomy service considerably increases driving comfort.\n\n## Powertrains, players in the energy 5) transition\n\nRenault continues to develop new emission control technologies for its internal combustion engines to reduce CO2 and particulate emissions.\n\nWe  are  responding  with  technological  propositions  that  strike  the best  balance  between  pollutant/CO2  emissions  and  cost  for  the customer.  Since  June  2020,  new  Groupe  Renault  vehicles  sold  to individuals  in  Europe  have  gradually  been  fitted  with  engines meeting  the  new  Euro  6D-Full  standard  thanks  to  new  pollution control technologies on its gasoline, diesel, hybrid and plug-in hybrid and LPG engines.\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  preparing  for  the  arrival  of  the  European  Euro 6D-Full  standard,  which  comes  into  force  for  passenger  cars  on January 1, 2021 (January 1, 2022 for commercial vehicles) and which strengthens  the  measurement  procedures  and  thresholds  for emissions of pollutants from thermal engines.\n\nTo support the energy transition, we rely on a comprehensive range of technologies: carbon-free hydrogen is one of them and part of the Groupe Renault's strategy. We have range extenders in our line-up of utility vehicles.\n\nGroupe Renault has a wealth of experience in LPG. We have been selling it for over 10 years in Europe. LPG has so many advantages: it is  more  ecological  (-12%  CO2/100km)  and  more  economical,  while also  being  more  efficient.  Groupe  Renault  is  offering  a  new  bi-fuel gasoline-LPG engine on the CLIO, CAPTUR, SANDERO, LOGAN and DUSTER  in  Europe,  the  TCe  ECO-G  100  (HR10).  In  gas  mode,  this engine  reduces  CO2  emissions  by  around  12%  compared  with gasoline mode.\n\nIn  the  Euro  6D-Full  format,  engine  performance  is  improved  by +10Nm  of  torque  and  +7kW  of  additional  power  because  gas combustion  has  greater  potential  than  gasoline.  The  cost  of  using LPG is equivalent to that of diesel, and its purchase cost is at least \u20ac1,500  lower.  LPG  is  20%  to  25%  cheaper  than  gasoline  per kilometer,  allowing  someone  driving  15,000  km  per  year  to  save roughly \u20ac200 on fuel.\n\nWe have a large distribution network, with 33,000 stations in Europe. 10% of the gas consumed is bio LPG in France, and this is constantly increasing.\n\n## Renewal of the international range 6)\n\nIn  2020,  Groupe  Renault  renewed  its  range  worldwide,  with  the DUSTER in Latin America, the new CAPTUR in Korea, and phase 2 for the  KAPTUR  in  Russia,  the  MEGANE,  the  KOLEOS,  the  TALISMAN and the ESPACE.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Performance levers 1.4.3\n\n## Modular design\n\nIntroduced  in  2013  as  a  source  of  increased  competitiveness  and synergies,  the  modular  design  approach  known  as  CMF  (Common Module  Family)  enables  the  standardization  of  architecture  across Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles.\n\nCMF has already generated an average reduction in product/process design costs of approximately 30 to 40% per model and a 20 to 30% reduction in parts costs. By 2022, 70% of Alliance vehicles and 80% of Groupe Renault vehicles will be manufactured on common platforms.\n\n## Common Alliance platforms\n\nCMF-EV is  'THE'  reference  platform  for  the  new  generation  of electric vehicles for Groupe Renault and the Alliance. This all-electric platform overcomes the constraints generated by thermal architectures  and  offers  a  new  level  of  service:  more  energy efficiency  for  more  range,  the  roominess  of  the  high-end  segment and all the driving pleasure of an electric vehicle.\n\nCMF-A is  the  Alliance's  small  city  car  platform.  Its  architecture  is electric compatible, and can accommodate all-electric vehicles. This is  the  case  for  the  Renault  CITY  K-ZE  and  the  Dacia  SPRING, unveiled in 2020.\n\nCMF-B is  the  Alliance's  modular  platform par  excellence .  By  2022, the CMF-B will carry more than 12 Alliance models, with a target of three  million  vehicles  in  series  production  after  the  complete renewal of the B segment in 10 plants worldwide. Its production was launched in 2019,  starting  with  the  CLIO  V  in  the  Bursa  and  Novo Mesto plants,  then  in  Valladolid  and  Sunderland  with  the  CAPTUR and  the  JUKE.  In  2020,  it  will  welcome  the  new  LOGAN  and SANDERO produced in the Pitesti and Tangiers plants. In addition to combustion  engines,  this  platform  is  compatible  with  LPG  and enables the electrification of vehicles (hybrid and plug-in hybrid). It is designed to accommodate advanced driving assistance leading to the  first  levels  of  driving  autonomy.  Its  architecture  makes  it possible to offer models adapted to the various markets in terms of services and costs.\n\nCMF-CD is the platform dedicated to C and D segment SUVs for each of  the  Alliance  partners.  It  equips  the  X-TRAIL/ROGUE  and  the Qashqai  for  Nissan  and  the  Outlander  for  Mitsubishi,  and  will support  the  renewal  of  the  KADJAR  and  the  KOLEOS  for  Renault. The platform is compatible with multiple energies (gasoline, hybrid and  plug-in  hybrid),  and  will  bring  this  generation  of  vehicles  a complete technological renewal for driving aids, connected services (including  the  integration  of  Google  Automotive  Services)  and  the ability to update systems remotely (Firmware Over The Air - FOTA). Groupe Renault vehicles will also benefit from specific advantages, such as multi-directional rear suspension (4CONTROL) or predictive controlled  damping  depending  on  the  models  and  trim  levels selected.  Within  the  Alliance,  nearly  10  million  vehicles  will  be produced  on  this  platform  and  brought  into  series  production  in eight  plants  across  all  major  global  automotive  markets  (United States, Japan, Europe, China and Russia).\n\nI\n\n## Software Engineering\n\nA new entity dedicated to software, the SOFTWARE FACTORY, was created in August 2020.\n\nThus,  Groupe  Renault  is  acquiring  specific  skills  in  the  software business  in  order  to  meet  the  future  challenges  of  mobility  and services, in addition to the necessary changes in on-board software architecture to build and offer new innovative services at any time in the vehicle's life. Software innovation is key to the vision of a smart, self-learning  car  with  Artificial  Intelligence  technologies  and  cloud extensions. The innovations and services provided to our customers are increasingly produced using software embedded in our vehicles or located in off-board servers.\n\nThe  SOFTWARE  FACTORY  delivers  reliable  and  robust  software based  on  a  unique,  continuous  and  cross-functional  software development process aimed at:\n\n- reducing associated customer complaints; P\n- controlling growing software complexity without allowing P development costs to spiral;\n- offering  customers  the  possibility  of  purchasing  new  services  or P functionalities throughout the life of their vehicle.\n\nThe  SOFTWARE  FACTORY  is  central  to  a  corporate  strategy (Renaulution)  geared  towards  delivering  constant  improvement  in the  customer  experience.  It  contributes  to  the  development  of innovative  services  to  generate  revenue  in  the  field  of  mobility services (where the target is 20-30% by 2030). The implementation of innovative software functions and their centralization on powerful processors  bring  significant  gains  on  the  manufacturing  cost  price and value for money, improving the attractiveness and profitability of our vehicles. The  SOFTWARE  FACTORY  brings  in-house development  expertise  (Make)  and  a  break  from  the  classic tier-based working model (tier-1 supplier) by seeking out technical expertise  at  the  source  and  relying  on  technological  partnerships (Google, Qualcomm, etc .) and by getting involved in automotive and consortium standards (Autosar, etc .).\n\n## System engineering\n\nThis  development  methodology,  which  Renault  has  gradually integrated  into  its  processes  and  tools  over  the  past  10  years, enables us to control the increase in complexity of our products and services while facilitating the reduction of diversity.\n\nAreas such as ADAS, connectivity and the electrification of traction are  obviously  targeted,  but  more  generally  the  entire  vehicle, ranging  from  its  'mechatronic'  perimeters  (openings,  active aerodynamics, etc .),  vehicle  assembly  and  off-shore  information systems  supporting  services  to  mobility  and  energy  ecosystems, where the challenges are not only technical and require building new collaborations.",

SWEET provides our physical platforms and vehicles with a large part of our products' on-board intelligence.\n\nMore specifically, SWEET is an Alliance software and electrical/electronic  platform  equipping  our  vehicles.  There  are several  generations  of  SWEET  (100,  200,  400, etc .)  arranged  in chronological order, with technical content adjusted to the needs of the Alliance range plan.\n\nSWEET100  equips  all  our  new  vehicles  from  the  new  CLIO. SWEET200  and  SWEET400  are  currently  in  development,  while SWEET200 will equip the new CMF-EV electric platform. SWEET is an important part of the Renaulution plan: it helps reduce costs and the  price  of  engineering,  and  helps  increase  carry-over  while remaining focused on the expectations of our customers.\n\n## Customer satisfaction plan: from reliability to customer satisfaction\n\n## Our goal: satisfy 100% of our customers\n\nThe  quality  of  our  products  is  the  cornerstone  of  our  customers' trust.  As  such,  quality  is  a  priority  for  all  our  brands  and  no compromise is acceptable. Within the framework of Renaulution, our goal is clear: 100% of our customers must be satisfied.\n\nEach  customer  is  unique  and  deserves  the  best:  a  long-lasting reliable car and impeccable end-to-end service.\n\nSo we aim not just for zero defects, but also to find solutions for each problem encountered by our customers.\n\nEach employee, from upstream to downstream, has a role to play on that front. To achieve our goal, Groupe Renault is strengthening its Customer Satisfaction Plan initiated in 2018. Three key points ensure constant quality at every stage of the customer experience:\n\n- zero defects. The first essential quality of a vehicle is its reliability. P The  services  of  our  products  are  designed  to  meet  customer expectations:  performance,  style,  perceived  quality,  comfort  and pleasure.  The  industrial  system  is  evolving  to  produce  'zero manufacturing defects' and ensure the proper functioning of all systems.  If  problems  arise,  they  are  dealt  with  locally  to  ensure maximum responsiveness;\n- sustainable quality. A car that ages well, that can be kept longer, is P the  assurance  of  keeping  the  pleasure  of  driving  intact  and preserving the resale value. A corporate approach has been put in place to push back the limits of sustainability and give vehicles a second  and  third  life.  Parts  are  being  strengthened  in  terms  of endurance, and electronic systems are being updated;\n- tailor-made services and a customized relationship. The network P offers  its  customers  services  tailored  to  both  the  sale  of  the vehicle (reception, advice, handling, financing and insurance) and after-sales  service  (support,  maintenance,  repair,  replacement. spare  parts, etc. ).  Listening  to  customers  during  their  visits  and the  provision  of  explanations  for  vehicle  servicing  have  been strengthened.\n\nThe customer is central to the quality approach. The entire company is committed to the satisfaction of its customers: from upstream to downstream, every detail counts.\n\nQuality  is  a  'state  of  mind'  deeply  entrenched  in  everyone's thoughts and actions throughout the Group.\n\n## The expertise network that serves all of the Group's functions\n\nThe  expertise  network  develops  and  harnesses  the  Company's knowledge  and  know-how  to  implement  its  strategic  orientations and contribute to its performance and customer satisfaction. It has an impact on the Group, and as such, serves the new brand-based organization together with all functions, and is actively involved in Renaulution.\n\nThe  expertise  network  consists  of  53  areas  of  strategic  expertise established in all major business lines, with a strong predominance in  engineering.  After  a  reorganization  of  the  powertrain  and manufacturing networks in 2020, the evolution of the segment is set to continue in 2021 to adapt to the Company's new organization by brands.\n\nThe network comprises four levels of expertise matching the needs of the business lines, and reflecting the Company's strategy and the expectations of our customers:\n\n- the  Expert  Fellow is  responsible  for  defining  and  ensuring  the P consistency  of  the  strategic  areas  of  expertise,  and  coordinates the Expert Leader network in order to structure production both at the strategic level and the operational level regarding technical or  methodological  innovations  and  support  for  projects  under development.  The  collaborative  work  carried  out  during  expert workshops  contributes  to  a  dynamic  of  shared  progress  for  the affected  business  activities  as  regards  the  Company's  main challenges, which are largely technical. The network can thus be described as an agile organization that serves the inter-business sector;\n- Expert Leaders, each reporting to a Business Vice-President, are P responsible for their roadmap. Expert leaders have responsibility for one of the 53 areas of strategic expertise. They structure and guide  their  internal  network  of  experts  and  use  an  external network consisting of universities, other manufacturers, associations, incubation structures, etc ., to enable the Company to work in an 'extended' way and expand it through involvement in collaborative or investment efforts;\n- looking  outside  the  Company,  273  Experts  are  in  charge  of P secondary  fields  of  expertise,  responsible  for  benchmarks, identifying  relevant  partners  and  investing  in  the  protection  of know-how through patents. They are responsible in particular for defining and promoting standards and processes;\n- responsible for Specialty professions, 509 Consultants further the P state of the art by being 'the point of reference' in their practice, thus developing standards on which the teams can then capitalize.\n\nThe  organization  of  the  Expertise  activity  and  its  agile  mode  of operation  allow  the  way  ahead  to  be  mapped  out  using  a  set  of coherent  roadmaps,  the  enhancement  of  knowledge  to  be accelerated through innovation and the performance of operations, thus allowing the business activities to excel in their various areas of expertise.\n\nI",

This  framework  applies  to  Groupe  Renault Automotive and Mobility Services Segments.\n\nThe  AVTOVAZ  group  has  management  autonomy  and  has implemented  an  internal  control  system  and  risk  management system in accordance with Russian legislation and the organization described in this section; any variations are indicated and explained.\n\nRCI  Banque  sales  financing  has  defined  its  own  internal  control framework  for  sales  financing  in  accordance  with  banking  and financial regulations. This system is outlined in section 1.5.1.4 'The RCI Banque group's specific features in terms of internal control and risk management'. RCI Banque is subject to controls by the French Prudential  Supervisory  Authority  (ACPR)  and  the  European  Central Bank (ECB).\n\n## The various actors involved in risk 1.5.1.1 management\n\nIn  2020,  the  Automotive  division  of  Groupe  Renault,  excluding AVTOVAZ,  was  structured  around  three  axes:  Regions,  Corporate Functions  and  Programs.  They  help  set  the  business  strategy  and implement it on a daily basis:\n\n- the 'Regions' axis develops the business in the field. The Regions P are  responsible  for  optimizing  the  business  and  generating profitable revenues;\n- the 'Corporate Functions' axis groups together all of the business P functions,  with  global  responsibility.  Corporate  Functions  define the policies, and supply the appropriate standards, methods and skills to the Programs and Regions;\n- the 'Programs' axis is responsible for the life-cycle of the vehicles P and services at a global level. Programs develop the vehicle ranges and services and manage their profitability.\n\nFrom  2021,  this  organization  will  change  to  comprise  four  brands and global functions. See sections 1.1.1 \"Management bodies\" and 1.1.3 \"Strategy\" for more details.\n\nThis structure does not exist for the AVTOVAZ group.\n\nSales  Financing  has  its  own  internal  control  and  risk  management systems and organization, as outlined in section 1.5.1.4.\n\nI\n\n01",

Employees  are  therefore  required  to  comply  with  the  internal control system defined for their field of activity, the Group's code of  ethics,  the  guide  for  preventing  corruption  and  influence peddling, as well as their own dedicated Codes of Ethics;\n- corporate functions, an essential link in the second line of control, P provide  ongoing  support  to  assess  the  proper  application  and effectiveness  of  risk  management.  This  monitoring  is  performed by:\n- the Internal Control department, which circulates P self-assessment  questionnaires  and  carries  out  compliance tests.  It  also  ensures  that  action  plans  are  identified  and implemented to correct the shortcomings identified,\n- the  Risk  Management  department,  which  is  responsible  for P updating  the  mapping  of  the  Group's  major  risks  and monitoring  action  plans  designed  to  reduce  the  impact  or probability  of  the  main  risks  identified,  and  for  providing support  for  the  risk  mapping  of  programs,  operating  entities and corporate functions,\n- the Group Performance Control department, with its P representatives in the entities, which coordinates and steers the process in  the  field.  It  ensures  that  all  personnel  comply  with management  rules  and  assists  operational  staff  in  the coordination of their action plans and monitoring,\n\nI\n\n- the  other  departments  of  the  so-called  'corporate'  functions, P which  are  responsible  at  the  global  level  for  establishing policies, standards and methods;\n- internal audit, the third line of control, assesses the functioning of P internal  control  and  risk  management  systems  and  makes recommendations for their improvement.\n\n## Internal Audit department\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  department  conducts  an  independent  and objective assessment of the corporate governance, risk management and control processes as defined within the Group. The mission, role, responsibilities and scope of internal audit are laid down in an audit charter whose updated version was approved by the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee (CARC) in May 2019. Through its recommendations, Internal Audit contributes to the improvement of operational security and the optimization of the overall performance of  the  company.  At  the  end  of  each  assignment,  Internal  Audit distributes a final report and summary  note, which are systematically  distributed  to  the  areas  audited,  the  functions/ entities/projects  in  question,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Chairman  of  the  Group.  The  summary  note  includes  an  opinion issued by Internal Audit that aims to give an overall assessment on the  level  of  control  of  the  audited  activities:  satisfactory  (green), some  improvements  needed  (yellow),  substantial  improvements needed (orange), insufficient (red).\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  department  covers  all  entities  and  activities  of Groupe Renault's automotive branch, excluding AVTOVAZ, which has its  own  internal  audit  structure.  The  financial  branch  (RCI  Banque) also  has  its  own  internal  audit  structure.  The  Internal  Audit department  can  also  audit  functions  that  have  converged  with Nissan.  For  entities  in  partnership  with  Groupe  Renault,  Internal Audit may intervene if the partner so agrees. For activities entrusted to  third  parties,  intervention  by  Internal  Audit  is  possible  if  the contract's audit clause so provides.\n\nAudit plans are made on an annual basis and cover a 2-year period. They are verified by Senior Management and approved by the Audit, Risks  and  Compliance  Committee.  The  audit  plans  are  revised  as often as necessary to take into account additional requests.\n\nInternal Audit missions make it possible to:\n\n- assess the compliance of processes and their application with the P rules, standards, laws and regulations in force;\n- assess  the  effectiveness  of  processes  and  the  performance  of P transactions;\n- verify  the  quality  of  the  controls  performed  by  the  operational P department and the support and control functions;\n- suggest  areas  for  improvement  or  progress  in  the  form  of P recommendations;\n- verify the effective implementation of the recommendations. P\n\nFollowing  the  recommendations  made  in  each  audit  report,  an action plan defined by the audited entities is approved by the audit function.  Recommendations  have  three  levels  of  criticality  (high, medium,  low,  identified  respectively  as  A,  B  and  C).  The  Internal Audit department ensures that the recommendations are implemented. Every six months, it prepares a progress report on A and B recommendations for the Group Executive Committee and the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee.",

This certification, in accordance with the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing ( r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel  professionnel  de  l'audit  interne -  RAI),  comprises  25 general requirements divided into 100 detailed requirements across five categories: positioning, steering, audit processes, GRC (governance,  risks  and  compliance)  assessment  program  and professionalism.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe  first  two  lines  of  defense  report  on  internal  control  and  risk management issues to dedicated committees: the Risks and Internal Control Committee ( Comit\u00e9 des risques et du contr\u00f4le interne , CRCI) and the Ethics and Compliance Committee ( Comit\u00e9 d'\u00e9thique et de conformit\u00e9 , CEC) presented in section 2.5.1. They occasionally report to the Executive Committee and the Operations Review Committee as part of thematic presentations. The aim of the Risks and Internal Control Committee is to regularly validate and assess the efficiency of the internal control and risk management systems.\n\nThe  second  and  third  line  of  defense  present  the  results  of  their work to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee (CARC), whose duties are defined in section 3.1.6.\n\nIn  the  course  of  their  duties,  the  statutory  auditors  assess  the internal control of the preparation and processing of accounting and financial data and, when necessary, issue recommendations.\n\n## The Group risk management system 1.5.1.2\n\nThe Group applies a risk management method based on one hand, on  identifying  and  assessing  risks  of  any  kind,  which  are  then mapped, and, on the other hand, on carrying out action plans to deal with these risks, and specifically their net impact and/or probability of  occurrence,  by  means  of:  elimination,  prevention,  protection  or transfer.  This  method  applies  to  the  Group,  entities,  vehicle programs  and  corporate  functions.  The  mapping  of  major  Group risks  (descending  and  ascending)  is  presented  to  the  Risks  and Internal Control Committee, the Group Executive Committee and the Audit, Risks and Ethics Committee, which validate it.\n\nThe major risk factors to which the Group is exposed are described in section 1.5.2.\n\nTo carry out its duties, the Risk Management department relies, in particular, on two networks:\n\n- one  comprising  managers  mainly  from  the  performance  and P control function, for the operating entities (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries) and corporate functions, and from the quality assurance function, for the programs. These managers are known as Operational Risk Managers (RMO). They work with the Risk Management department on the operational implementation of risk management systems within the entities, the programs and corporate functions;\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nGroupe Renault's segments of activity. These experts are known as Expert Risk Managers (RME) and consult on the standardized risk management plans in their area of expertise.\n\nTo draw up the audit plan for the Company's major risks, which is validated  by  Senior  Management  and  approved  by  the  CARC,  the Internal  Audit  department  uses  risk  maps  to  identify  the  most pertinent  audit  themes  and  assess  risk  coverage.  Through  its auditing  task,  the  Internal  Audit  department  provides  the  Risk Management  department  with  insight  on  the  effective  level  of control of major risks.\n\nThe risk management policy is applied at Group level for major risks. It  is  also  rolled  out  at  operating  entity  level  (countries,  commercial and/or  industrial  subsidiaries),  for  vehicle  programs  and  global functions.\n\nIn 2020, the Risk Management department focused its activities on:\n\n- updating the mapping of the Group's major risks. This process was P carried  out  in  a  descending  direction  in  relation  to  the  Group's medium-term strategic plan, which was developed during 2020, so that  it  will  integrate  the  treatment  plans  responding  to  the identified risks;\n- the  strengthening  of  treatment  plans  and  processes  to  improve P the control of the major risks identified previously;\n- assistance to operating entities in the implementation of country, P industrial  site  and  commercial  subsidiary  risk  mappings,  carried out with the operational risk managers of the relevant entities;\n- assistance to the program or project departments in creating risk P mapping for projects;\n- assistance to the corporate functions. P\n\nIn  addition,  awareness-raising  actions  for  Group  employees  about risk  culture  and  the  fundamentals  of  risk  management  were continued  by  the  Risk  Management  department  (communication and training, in particular through e-learning modules).\n\nIn 2021, the Risk Management department's activities will continue to focus on these priority areas.\n\n## The Group internal control system 1.5.1.3\n\n## Group ethics and Corporate Function guidelines\n\nThe  'Corporate  Functions'  define  and  issue  the  policies  and standards to be deployed, which are then rolled out as procedures and operating methods to ensure that processes at operational level function  in  accordance  with  the  principles  outlined  in  the  code  of ethics,  the  Guide  for  preventing  corruption  and  influence  peddling and the dedicated Codes of Ethics.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  department  distributes  guidelines  (Minimum Control Standards & Control Basic Rules) that list the main themes to be controlled and incorporated into the operational staff's control activities.\n\n- the other made up of experts who manage a specific area of risks.

All  the  rules  for delegating decision-making authority are communicated to personnel  via  the  intranet.  Decision  requests  are  tracked  in  a workflow  that  implements  the  rules  specifying  the  persons  to  be involved, in accordance  with  internal  control  procedures  or documented  in  the  minutes  of  the  committees  responsible  for making the decision.\n\nThe  principle  of  separation  of  offices  and  tasks  is  required  at  all hierarchical  and  functional  levels  within  the  Group,  and  within  the computer systems, to facilitate independent control and to separate tasks  and  functions  corresponding  to  operations,  the  protection  of property and their booking for accounting purposes.\n\n## Implementation of objectives\n\nEach year, the Internal Control department runs an internal control campaign  in  which  self-assessment  questionnaires  are  sent  to  the Group's  main  entities.  The  CEOs  of  the  entities  validate  these self-assessments and commit to defining and implementing action plans to remedy any internal control shortcomings identified. These action plans are subject to annual monitoring by the Internal Control department. The results of these self-assessments are presented to the  Risks  and  Internal  Control  Committee  and  Audit,  Risks  and Compliance Committee once a year.\n\nCompliance tests are conducted on the basis of a sample of entities by  the  internal  controllers  of  the  Internal  Control  department  to verify  the  quality  of  the  self-assessments.  This  internal  control system  applies  to  the  parent  company  and  all  significant  entities, fully consolidated companies in particular.\n\nEntities  with  lower  risk  levels  (entities  not  fully  consolidated  or unconsolidated  entities)  are  subject  to  separate  internal  control systems.\n\nThe work of the Internal Control department in 2020 included:\n\n- continued action to improve the corruption prevention system and P support for the operational staff concerned;\n- work  designed  to  make \"m\u00e9tier\" prescribers  more  involved  into P internal control self-assessment to better assess operational risks;\n- the roll-out of training courses on internal control, in particular on P the method for analyzing the separation of duties with standard matrices  on  the  main  risky  processes;  more  than  455  managers and 43 Management Committees have been trained over the last three years;\n- definition  of  preventive  and  detection  controls  based  on  a  data P analytics unit;\n- review  of  the  rules  for  delegation  of  authority,  in  particular P following changes in the Group's method of governance.\n\nThe Tone at the Top in terms of internal control was reaffirmed by the circulation of an editorial signed by the Group CFO, positioning\n\nI\n\ninternal  control  as  an  essential  feature  of  management  and  a  key performance driver.\n\nThe  priorities  in  2021  will  be  to  continue  these  underlying  actions begun in previous years.\n\n## The RCI Banque group's specific 1.5.1.4 features in terms of internal control and risk management\n\nRCI  Banque  has  a  global  internal  control  system  which  aims  to identify, analyze and manage the main risks identified in relation to the Company's objectives. The RCI Banque group's Internal Control Committee  has  validated  the  general  framework  for  this  system, which is described in the Internal Control Charter.\n\nThis Charter defines the system applicable to the French and foreign companies over which RCI Banque has effective control and specifies in particular:\n\n- the general arrangements for managing internal control; P\n- the local arrangements for subsidiaries, branches and P joint-ventures;\n- the special arrangements for various functional areas. P\n\nRisk control at RCI is overseen on three levels by separate functions:\n\n- the first line of control is exercised by the operational functions in P charge of day-to-day risk management as part of the activities in their area of expertise. These functions decide and are responsible for  taking  risks  in  the  conducting  of  transactions  and  the objectives  assigned  to  them.  They  exercise  this  responsibility  in accordance with the management rules and the risk limits defined by the Corporate functional departments.\n- The  Corporate  functional  departments  are  in  charge  of  risk definition, rules, management  methods,  measurement  and monitoring at the corporate level. Each department, in its area of expertise, manages and oversees the risk management system via guidelines  and  country  objectives.  Risk  is  monitored  by  periodic dedicated  committees  in  both  the  subsidiaries  and  centrally. These  departments  rely  on  local  representatives  for  risk measurement and exposure monitoring and ensure that limits are respected at the group level;\n- the second line of defense includes: P\n- the Internal Control department and the internal controllers for P the  Group  entities,  which  control  the  level  of  compliance  of transactions  with  the  management  rules  defined  in  the procedures.  More  specifically,  they  verify  the  relevance  of  the first line of control,\n- the Risk and Banking Regulations department, which oversees P the deployment of the Group's risk governance policy, verifies the efficiency of risk management  by  the  functional departments  and  of  compliance  with  the  limits  and  alert thresholds established and ensures that the Risk Committee of the RCI Board of Directors is notified when those thresholds are exceeded;\n- the third line of defense is the internal audit function, which aims P to  provide  assurance  to  RCI  Banque's  Board  of  Directors  and Senior Management about the degree of control over transactions and the oversight exercised by the first two lines.",

You are reminded that the Group comprises  the  following  operating  divisions:  Automotive  excluding AVTOVAZ,  which  includes  Groupe  Renault's  automotive  activities (hereafter  known  as  'Automotive'),  AVTOVAZ,  which  includes  the AVTOVAZ group and its parent company, Alliance Rostec Auto B.V., Sales  Financing  (the  RCI  Banque  group  and  its  subsidiaries),  and Mobility  Services,  which  brings  together  new  mobility  service activities  under  the  Renault  M.A.I.  holding  company.  Each of  these has its own risk management system, which is used to keep the risks related to its activities under control. These systems are described in section  1.5.1.  The  Risk  Management  department  carries  out  a summary to obtain an overview of the risks to which Groupe Renault is  exposed.  For  AVTOVAZ,  the  risk  management  system  is  unique, based on methodologies that are widely shared with Groupe Renault with a view to gradual harmonization and increasing maturity.\n\nThis  identification  of  risks  is  based  on  assessments  of  residual impact and probability of occurrence (after taking into account the management  plans),  the  product  of  these  two  terms  defining criticality. For risk factors whose criticality for the Group is high, we specify  which  factor  is  decisive  in  this  criticality  (e.g.  \"impact  > probability\")  or  whether  the  impact  and  probability  contribute evenly (\"impact = probability\").\n\n## RISK FACTORS FOR GROUPE RENAULT\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk  factors  presented  in  this  section  are  those  identified  by  the Group  as  significant  factors  that  could,  at  the  horizon  of  its medium-term strategic plan, have a negative impact on its image, its assets,  the  conduct  of  its  activities  and  the  achievement  of  its objectives, and whose criticality is rated at the highest levels on the Group's risk scale. The risks presented in chapter 2.1.6 'Extra-financial performance' of this Document, have been included in  this  analysis.  Depending  on  their  materiality,  they  fed  into  the description of certain risk factors. This is the case, for example, with risks  related  to  global  warming,  the  protection  of  personal  data  or supplier relations.\n\nIt  cannot  however  be  ruled  out  that  other  risk  factors  currently considered  insignificant  or  not  identified  could  in  the  future adversely  affect  the  Group.  Potential  evolutions  in  the  mid-term strategic plan of the Group may also induce changes in the nature or relative  weight  of  risk  factors.  It  should  actually  be  noted  that  the major risk mapping is updated every year, in close collaboration with the preparatory work and implementation of the strategic plan, so that  the  plan  integrates  the  appropriate  action  plans  designed  to respond to the operational or strategic risks identified.\n\nThe major risk factors resulting from the Group's analysis for all of its  operating  segments  are  summarized  in  the  following  table  and presented below. In each of the five categories, risk factors with the higher criticality levels are described at the beginning.\n\n|                        |                                                                                                                                 | CRITICALITY LEVEL   | CRITICALITY LEVEL   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                        |                                                                                                                                 | MEDIUM              | HIGH                |\n| STRATEGY               | Risk of insufficient performance of the Alliance                                                                                |                     |                     |\n|                        | Risk of insufficient response to disruption of existing activities                                                              |                     |                     |\n| OPERATIONS             | Risks related to geopolitical instability and economic conditions Risk of insufficient capacity to restore margins              |                     |                     |\n|                        | Risk of supply chain interruption                                                                                               |                     |                     |\n|                        | Risk of natural, health or industrial disasters                                                                                 |                     |                     |\n| PRODUCTS  AND SERVICES | Risk of inadequate product and service definition or execution Risk of inadequate innovation in relation to market expectations |                     |                     |\n|                        | Risk of product or service quality defects                                                                                      |                     |                     |\n|                        | Bank counterparty risk                                                                                                          |                     |                     |\n|                        | Interest rate risk                                                                                                              |                     |                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  the  following  descriptions,  this  logo  identifies  the  risk  factors  on  which  global  warming  has  a  significant  impact  (see  chapter 'Extra-Financial Performance Declaration' of this Document for more details).\n\nI",

        "page_content": "INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Risks related to strategy 1.5.2.1\n\n## Risk of inadequate performance by the Alliance high risk with impact > probability\n\nThe Group's membership of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance brings  a  major  contribution  to  the  success  of  the  Group  and  its strategic plan. In the context of its members' deteriorating financial performance  and  the  global  health  crisis,  the  Alliance's  member companies have focused their strategy on efficiency and competitiveness rather than volumes. This situation, in the context of  the  Alliance  governance in place since March 2019 (see Chapter 1.2.3  of  this  Document),  could  result  in  a  risk  of  insufficient performance  due  to  reduced  or  less  optimal  sharing  within  the Alliance  of  platforms,  technologies  and,  more  generally,  the investments  necessary  for  the  development  of  product  ranges, which  would  jeopardize  the  future  competitiveness  of  the  Group's offering and the achievement of its revenues and earnings targets. In addition, the product cycle and the transition towards the end of diesel  could  also  result  in  a  decline  in  business  volumes  between Nissan and Renault. Lastly, Nissan's financial position could limit the distribution of dividends to the Group for this year, as was the case in 2020.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board (AOB), created on March 12, 2019, is responsible  for  operational  coordination  between  Renault,  Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors and for new initiatives creating value for their respective  shareholders  and  employees.  On  May 27,  2020,  the Alliance announced the new cooperation business model in order to improve  the  competitiveness  and  profitability  of  its  three  member companies.  Alliance  partners  use  the  leader-follower  model  to enhance  the  efficiency  and  competitiveness  of  vehicles  and technologies.  Each  member  becomes  a  reference  in  the  regions where it has the best strategic assets, and acts as a facilitator and provider of support for the competitiveness of the other members.\n\nThe announcement of the upcoming launch of the MEGANE eVision on the shared CMF-EV platform also used by Nissan is an illustration of essential synergies and joint developments. In addition, under the new  strategic  plan  announced  on  January  14,  2021,  the  aim  is  to derive  80%  of  the  Group's  volumes  from  three  Alliance  platforms. Alliance  members  ensure  they  are  always  at  the  forefront  of  the industry  in  terms  of  their  performance,  products,  technologies  and markets,  while  continuing  to  benefit  from  joint  purchasing  and development.\n\n## Risk of insufficient response to a disruption of/uni00A0existing activities medium risk\n\nThe proportion of business carried  out  by  digital  means  is  steadily increasing and could lead to the disruption of existing activities by favoring  disintermediation  through  the  arrival  of  new  players attracted  by  the  direct  contact  with  customers.  This  trend  is emerging  in  businesses  linked  to  new  mobility  (car-sharing, connected services, etc .),  but also in existing and traditional sectors of  sales  of  services  or  automotive  products,  sales  and  after-sales, used vehicles and sales financing, which represent a significant part of our  profitability  (the  contribution  of  the  Sales  Financing operational segment to Groupe Renault's consolidated net income is a profit of \u20ac789 million in 2020).\n\nI\n\nThe different forms of lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic have only reinforced this. The risk for Groupe Renault is that part of its  business  or  value  chain  may  be  captured  by  these  new  players (which  may  come  from  the  world  of  technology),  positioning themselves between Groupe Renault and its customers.\n\n## Risk management\n\nGroupe  Renault  has  always  paid  close  attention  to  customer relations, both directly and through its subsidiary RCI Banque, which has  direct  and  regular  contact  with  its  customers.  In  addition,  on September  3,  2020,  Groupe  Renault  announced  its  reorganization around its brands into four Business Units  (see section 1.1.3), each of which will focus on value creation and concentrate resources on market segments and associated customer expectations.\n\nSpecific  action  plans  have  been  put  in  place  by  the  after-sales business line, RCI Banque and Mobility Services to reduce the risk of disintermediation  in  the  medium  term.  The  aim  is  to  propose innovative  offers  to  customers,  including  new  mobility  services  in order  to  increase  contact  with  customers  throughout  the  vehicle's life cycle.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  pursuing  its  digital  transformation,  notably through its subsidiary Renault Digital, in order to develop the agile tools and organizations needed to be competitive.\n\n## Risk of insufficient capacity to develop new/uni00A0businesses medium risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAgainst  a  background  of  deep  and  sustained  transformation  in demand and the mobility offerings, in line with societal changes and environmental  and  climate  issues,  Groupe  Renault  could  be  faced with an inadequate ability, within a given timeframe, to change its business  model,  to  anticipate  and  adapt  to  changes  and  possible disruptions of markets, mobility offers and related value chains, and thus  to  develop  new  business.  This  could  lead  to  lower  revenues than  the  objectives  over  the  affected  portions  of  the  Group's commercial  offering,  as  a  result  of  a  lack  of  innovation  and inadequate  preparation  for  its  future,  beyond  the  deadlines  of  the current strategic plan.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's strategic plan aims to make this risk an opportunity by mobilizing  (if  necessary  through  the  use  of  new  organizations)  the resources  of  the  Group,  the  Alliance,  RCI  Banque,  targeted partnerships  and  acquisitions,  so  as  to  structure  a  strong  and innovative sustainable, electric, autonomous and connected mobility offer.  These  innovative  service  offerings  will  be  housed  within  the automotive brands, but also within the new Mobilize Business Unit, whose  scope  goes  beyond  the  traditional  framework.  The  recent decision  to  create  this  Business  Unit  paves  the  way  for  the  future: Groupe Renault is aiming to derive more than 20% of its revenues from new businesses by 2030. The November  25, 2020 announcement  of  the  Re-Factory  project  in  Flins,  Europe's  first circular economy plant dedicated to mobility, is another example of the ongoing transformation into innovative offers.",

Some of these countries may present specific risks that could have an  adverse  impact  on  the  Group's  industrial  and  commercial operations,  sales,  revenues,  income  statement  or  balance  sheet, despite a geographical spread of sales that limits the overall impact of  regional  contingencies  while  taking  advantage  of  opportunities. These risks and opportunities may relate to the changing economic related  situations,  political  or  regulatory  instability,  social  unrest, protectionism, nationalizations, fluctuating interest rates and exchange rates, lack of foreign currency liquidity or foreign exchange control  measures.  In  2020,  the  risks  were  also  health-related,  in relation with the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, such as the  numerous  production  unit,  suppliers  site  and  customer  sales point  shut-downs.  The  health  crisis  has  also  contributed  to  the deterioration  of  the  economic  situation.  These  disruptions  were experienced on all markets by most of automotive industry actors. Groupe Renault and the industry remain exposed to the risk related to geopolitical instability and economic  conditions and its consequences depending on the evolution of the health situation.\n\n## Specific risks\n\n## Europe\n\nThe  Group's  activities  remain  heavily  dependent  on  the  European market,  which  in  2020  represented  approximately  half  of  its  sales (see the Group's worldwide sales in Chapter 1.1.3.2 of this Document and the breakdown of sales in the Europe Region).\n\n## Eurasia\n\nIn Turkey, the Group  is  exposed  to  geopolitical  risk, and macroeconomic and regulatory instability. As a result, the market is highly volatile, leading the Group to implement a risk management policy  aimed  at  combining  the  short-term  adaptability  of  its production  system  and  the  preparation  of  alternative  solutions  for the  main  logistics  flows.  Turkey  accounted  for  less  than  5%  of Groupe Renault sales and just over 11% of production in 2020 (see chapters  1.1.3.2  and  1.1.3.4  of  this  Document  for  sales  and production  figures  for  2019,  as  well  as  chapter  1.1.3.8  for  the renewal of the partnership with Oyak).\n\nIn  Russia,  the  Group  ensures,  through  its  various  sites  and  via  the AVTOVAZ group, a major player in the Russian market (see chapter 1.1.3.1  paragraph  Lada:  complete  transformation  of  the  range continues  and  chapter  1.1.6.2  Detailed  organization  chart  at December 31, 2020),  a  management  aligned  as  closely  as  possible with  fluctuations  in  the  economic  environment.  This  management, which is likely to affect sales volumes (which represented 13% of the Group's sales in 2020), revenues and profits (see chapters 1.1.3.2 for sales and 1.1.3.8 for the 2020 results), includes the consideration of:\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- risks  related  to  the  political  and  economic  situation  (economic P sanctions  or  other  factors  of  instability  resulting  in  changes  in government  policy  in  support  of  local  integration  and  export assistance);\n- risks related to changes in customs regulations; P\n- risks related to the situation of local suppliers. P\n\nStronger  local  integration  also  remains  a  priority  at  all  production facilities.  In  2020,  production  at  the  sites  in  Russia  represented slightly less than 19% of Groupe Renault's production (see chapter 1.1.3.4).\n\n## Americas\n\nIn a volatile political and economic environment that has worsened with the global health crisis, the main countries in the region have been impacted by exchange rates and falling GDP. The automotive market fell  as  a  result,  and  the  Americas  region  accordingly  rolled out  a  vigorous  plan  in  2020  with  the  restructuring  of  industrial capacity accompanied by a reduction in headcount, the elimination of  unprofitable  sales  and  higher  price  increases  than  the  market. These measures helped offset most of the exogenous impacts from the time the market recovery started in the second half of 2020. The subsidiaries  benefit  from  an  increasingly  optimized  structure  that should make it possible,  if  necessary,  to  face  further  turbulence  in 2021 or benefit fully if  there  is  an  economic  recovery.  In  this  plan, sales in the Americas accounted for less than 9% of Groupe Renault sales in 2020, compared with more than 11% in 2019.\n\n## Africa, Middle-East, India, Pacific\n\nIn  Iran,  US  sanctions  continued  to  apply  throughout  the  year, preventing  the  import  of  all  foreign  components  for  vehicle production in the country (see chapter 1.1.3.8 of this Document).\n\nIn  Algeria,  faced  with  an  economic  crisis  and  diminishing  foreign exchange  reserves,  the  public  authorities  have  blocked  since  early 2020  all  imports  of  components  for  vehicle  production,  which  has halted production (see chapters 1.1.3.2 and 1.1.3.4 of this Document for  sales  and  production,  1.1.3.8  for  partnership  data,  and  1.1.6). Groupe  Renault  has  taken  measures  to  safeguard  its  local  assets, with  a  structured  plan  to  adapt  the  workforce  and  shut  down  the RAP plant in Oran. The site has been preserved, and will be able to resume for the needs of the Group when the broader context  allows.\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn terms of industrial locations, the Group's geographical choices are made taking into account the risks of instability built into a global industrial approach in order to ensure risk diversification. Manufacturing  investments  represent  a  major  part  of  the  Group's exposure to political risks. Country risk related to manufacturing and financial  investment  is  in  principle  not  hedged,  but  the  risk  of non-achievement  of  objectives  is  included  in the expected profitability calculation. From an operational standpoint, the Group continuously  increases  the  level  of  local  integration  in  order  to reduce the impact of political and foreign exchange risks and make its products more competitive.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  hedges  against  the  risk  of  non-payment  for most  payments  originating  from  high-risk  countries.  The  main exceptions  relate  to  intra-Group  sales,  sales  to  industrial  partners and  to  countries  for  which  there  is  no  possible  hedging.  Residual country risk is regularly monitored.\n\nIn  order  to  centrally  manage  the  risk  of  non-payment  and  put  in place hedges on competitive terms, the Group has designed a 'hub and  spoke'  invoicing  system.  Manufacturing  subsidiaries  sell  their exported production to Renault s.a.s, which sells it on to commercial subsidiaries  and  independent  importers,  granting  them  supplier credit. The associated risk is managed by the parent company. Some sales between countries covered by customs agreements do not use this system, however.\n\nAs  for  the  consequences  on  economic  conditions  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic,  starting  from  the  very  first  restrictions,  Groupe  Renault has  implemented  multi-functional  crisis  management  cells,  which convened  on  a  daily  basis  at  the  start  of  the  health  crisis,  weekly later, to define in a coordinated and hands-on manner the reactions to  be  implemented  within  the  company,  but  also  upstream  with suppliers and downstream with network and customers. The Group has  adjusted  several  of  its  processes  to  improve  its  reactivity  to present  and  future  consequences  of  the  pandemic  or  any  other similar systemic crisis. For example, the commercial demand versus industrial response balancing process was able to operate efficiently on  a  weekly  rather  than  monthly  basis.  This  flexibility  in  closely shadowing  market  evolution  is  paramount  in  Groupe  Renault's strategy in order to protect employees, optimize financial performance and seize all possible opportunities.\n\n## Risk of insufficient ability to restore margins high risk with impact > probability\n\nRestoring financial performance is a priority for Groupe Renault, as announced  on  May  29,  2020  when  the  2o20  plan  was  released. Despite internal control systems, installed production capacities are greater than the volumes sold, product costs have ballooned under the  effect  of  regulations  and  technological  choices  that  are  not financially  efficient  enough  to  offset  this  increase,  and  overall profitability  suffers  from  the  Group's  exposure  to  unprofitable countries and reduced presence in profitable segments such as the C and  C+  segments.  The  rapidly  changing  competitive  environment could result in an inability to restore the margins needed to finance the  investments  of  the  medium-term  strategic  plan  announced  on January 14, 2021.\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn the Renaulution plan announced on January 14, 2021 (see chapter 1.1.3 of this Document), cost-cutting targets were strengthened. The \"2o22 plan\" announced in May 2020, which targeted a reduction of more  than  \u20ac2  billion  in  fixed  expenses  over  three  years  compared with  2019,  has  been  accelerated  and  extended  to  \u20ac2.5  billion  by 2023, with a target of \u20ac3 billion by 2025. The plan also provides for a reduction  in  variable  expenses  of  \u20ac600  per  vehicle  by  2023.  To tighten  its  cost  control  and  financial  performance  within  the framework  of  these  objectives,  Groupe  Renault  appointed  a  Chief Turnaround  Officer  at  the  end  of  2020,  tasked  with  restoring profitability in the short and medium terms. His scope for action and decision-making is based on the four pillars of profitability: variable costs, revenues, fixed costs and working capital.\n\nI\n\n## Risk of supply chain interruption high risk with/uni00A0impact > probability\n\nThe Group's business relies heavily on a complex system of supply and  delivery  chains,  both  upstream  and  downstream  of  its production  facilities.  Various  components  of  these  supply  chains could prove to be defective, despite the existing control system, the characteristics  and  strengthening  of  which  are  described  below. Such  breakdowns  could  lead  to  technical,  planning  or  economic inefficiencies, or even interruptions in vehicle production, transport and/or  delivery  to  distribution  networks  and  end-customers,  with negative  consequences  for  the  Group's  sales,  revenues,  profits  or customer  satisfaction.  These  potential  interruptions  may  be  either internal  -  due  in  particular  to  the  interdependence  underlying  the Group's industrial network (see chapter 1.1.3.4 of this Document) or  external,  as  seen  in  the  COVID-19  health  crisis,  and  can  be analyzed according to the following typology:\n\n- supplier default; P\n- interruption in supply or transport systems; P\n- interruption in supply of raw materials. P\n\n## Supplier default\n\nGroupe Renault relies on a tier-one supplier base comprising more than 800 parts supplier groups and more than 400 service providers, with  which  it  maintains  significant  business  relationships.  These suppliers  may  present  risks  of  interruption  in  the  design  and production of compliant quality parts, in meeting delivery deadlines, in providing the necessary production capacity and in the financial, strategic, industrial, social and management,  supply chain, sustainable development and compliance fields.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the accelerating decline in diesel engines, 2020 saw a further weakening of the supplier base in all of the  countries  where  Groupe  Renault  operates.  These  factors  have contributed to the significant increase in the number of suppliers at risk.  At  the  end  of  2020,  this  proportion,  usually  between  5%  and 10%, was between 10% and 15%.\n\nHowever, the implementation of support measures for industry, in all countries  around  the  world  and  in  particular  in  France (State-guaranteed  loans  (PGE),  coverage  of  tax  and  social  security expenses, etc .)  has  enabled  the  supplier  base  not  to  suffer  from multiple  interruptions  and  domino  effects.  The  supplier  base  has nevertheless increased its debt, which makes it more vulnerable over the long term.\n\nThese difficulties have been observed in all of the Group's sourcing countries, with the situation looking worse in Germany, the United Kingdom,  Spain  and  South  America,  compared  to  the  stronger resilience of the Turkish, Indian, Russian and, thanks to the action of the public authorities, French supplier bases.\n\nAt  the  start  of  2021,  breaks  in  the  supply  chain  for  electronic components  appear  in  the  industry,  particularly  the  automotive industry, and lead to production interruptions. The consequences of these ruptures for the Groupe Renault are analysed in real time and decisions are taken to limit their impact. Risk management systems are  also  mobilized  for  this  purpose.  As  of  the  filing  date  of  this Document, we expect that production losses will occur mainly in the first half, with a catch-up in the second half. We have assumed the risk  of  a  net  loss  of  around  100,000  vehicles  over  the  year.  We  are working with our suppliers to reduce this  risk,  but  cannot  rule  out the possibility of additional factors arising in this complex chain.",

Vigilance  is  especially  reinforced insofar  as  Groupe  Renault  does  not  have  a  systematic  policy  of multi-sourcing;\n- implementation of action plans on detection of non-compliance or P supplier risk.\n\nThe prevention policy concerns both risks under human control such as those listed, and risks outside human control (natural disasters for example).  Renault,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  thus  have  a  business continuity plan program.\n\nAll  of  these  risks  are  dealt  with  in  Purchasing  Risk  Committees,  at Group  level  and  for  each  local  Purchasing  department.  A  specific focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the supplier base and its resilience has been set-up in 2020 and will be maintained as long  as  the  consequences  of  the  crisis  last.  With  regard  to  supply disruptions  of  electronic  components,  the  Groupe  Renault  has activated,  in  accordance  with  its  usual  management  processes,  an internal  and  external  multi-business  team  which  decides  on  the corrective measures to be implemented to minimize the impact on the production of its plants or on its sales.\n\n## Interruption to supply or transport systems\n\nThe  risks  identified  relate  to  planning,  production,  transport  or delivery interruptions of parts, upstream of vehicle production sites, or  vehicles,  downstream  of  these  sites,  which  could  impact  sales, revenues, profits of the Group or customer satisfaction. Among these risks, we are seeing a steady increase in cybersecurity risk among our logistics suppliers. We have also seen a significant increase of these upstream  and  downstream  units  shut-downs  in  2020  due  to  the COVID-19 pandemic related constraints.\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThese  risks,  which  are  assessed  in  the  dual  context  of  the interdependence  of  the  Group's  industrial  network  extended  to  its global suppliers and the footprint of the distribution network (see in particular  section  1.1.3.5  of  this  Document),  are  subject  to  a comprehensive prevention and protection system whose robustness is constantly being strengthened.\n\nThis system, shared within the Alliance, is thus being strengthened, as described below.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Supply Chain is running a 'Control Tower' program. Through the roll-out of digital processes and with an end-to-end vision, it aims to manage risks at the appropriate levels of the organizations and to apply consistent methods between the Group's various regions and business  lines.  The  program,  which  covers  the  risks  of  supplier default as well as within the supply and transport system, aims to:\n\n- detect  demand  through  an  integrated  sales  and  operational P planning process;\n- manage supply capacity and supplier default; P\n- manage the logistics  capacities  of  transporters,  warehouses  and P parks;\n- anticipate risks. P\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the ability of the Supply  Chain  to  operate  in  a  short  loop  to  be  more  responsive  to fluctuations  in  the  environment.  The  commercial  demand  versus industrial response balancing process was able to operate efficiently on a weekly rather than monthly basis. This experience allowed us to validate the effectiveness of our digital tools. The Supply Chain crisis management system, which has been in place for many years, is the central  tool  for  responding  to  occasional  crises  and  contingencies (border  blockages,  weather  crises,  shortage  of  means  of  transport, cybersecurity, etc .).\n\n## Interruption in supply of raw materials\n\nThe risks identified relate to potential supply restrictions (imbalance between supply and demand, sourcing issues, geopolitical disturbances) and raw material prices, the variations in which can be significant  and  sudden.  Purchases  of  raw  materials  account  for approximately one-third of the total purchasing budget. Three-quarters of such raw material purchases are deemed strategic because they are liable  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  production conditions  or  are  experiencing  significant  imbalances  between supply  and  demand.  In  addition,  in  2020,  the  COVID-19  pandemic resulted  in  difficulties  related  to  the  production  or  extraction  of materials due to lockdown measures or a shortage of personnel (on precious  metals  in  South  Africa  for  instance),  or  difficulties  in adapting  material  production  capacity  to  the  uncertainties  of demand  (particularly  for  steel,  with  significant  tension  relating  to the  resumption  of  blast  furnaces).  Measures  implemented  by  the company  with  its  suppliers  made  it  possible  to  avoid  any  major impact.\n\nI",

The Group is also reinforcing the control of materials contained in parts and components through a  panel  of  approved  materials  and  the  performance  of  detailed analysis of material prices in the costing of parts.\n\nIn terms of technical policies, the Group is actively working to reduce the  use  of  or  to  substitute  sensitive  materials  such  as  cobalt, palladium  and  rhodium.  It  continues  to  also  develop  the  use  of recycled materials (precious metals in particular) and the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. The new Re-Factory project in Flins announced on November 25, 2020 is a further step in this direction.\n\nIn a forward-looking approach, the Group reassesses its forecasts on a bi-monthly basis for the main indexed and non-indexed items. At the same time, it ensures permanent monitoring of critical materials markets and suppliers.\n\nFinally,  to  reduce  risks  and  limit  exposure  to  market  fluctuations, Groupe  Renault  negotiates  annual  raw  materials  supply  contracts whenever  possible  and  appropriate.  Furthermore,  a  systematic hedging  policy  has  been  put  in  place  for  the  main  indexed commodities.\n\n## Risk of natural, health-related or industrial disasters medium risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's operating sites, whether manufacturing sites, engineering  and  testing  centers,  logistics  platforms  or  even commercial sites are exposed to the risk of industrial accidents, fires, explosions and machine breakdowns. In addition, some facilities (see in  particular  section  1.1.3.4  of  this  Document  presenting  the  main industrial  sites)  are  subject  to  the  risk  of  natural  disasters: earthquakes  (particularly  in  Chile,  Turkey,  Romania,  Colombia, Slovenia and Morocco), but also floods or submersions (particularly in  France  and  Korea),  with  the  latter  risks  being  increased  by  the higher  frequency  of  external  climate  events  related  to  global warming.\n\nThe  occurrence  of  one  of  these  risks,  despite  the  prevention  and resilience policies presented  below,  could  harm  people,  the environment  or  the  sites  concerned  and  lead  to  significant disruptions  in  their  ability  to  operate  affected  sites  -  potentially damaging  the  Group's  assets  and/or  overall  performance  (sales, revenues, income statement or balance sheet), particularly through industrial interdependencies.\n\nA  global  pandemic,  such  as  the  current  COVID-19  pandemic,  can result  in  significant  and  shifting  health  threats  in  countries  where the  Group  operates.  Such  situations  may  be  accompanied  by\n\nI\n\nmeasures imposing restrictions on the free movement of people and goods,  disrupting  the  opening  of  sales  or  after-sales  outlets  of distribution networks and the smooth running of industrial sites. The main  impacts  of  such  situations  would  be  on  the  health  and availability of the Group's personnel and its suppliers, as well as on financial  performance  (sales,  cash  flow  and  cash)  and,  potentially, the value of certain balance sheet assets.\n\n## Risk management\n\nOver  the  past  30  years,  the  Group  has  been  committed  to implementing and developing an ambitious and rigorous prevention policy (safety of people, property and business continuity). Excluding AVTOVAZ, more than 93% of the assets (industry, engineering and logistics) covered by the 'property damage  and  business interruption'  insurance  program  were  awarded  the  international 'Highly Protected Risk (HPR)' label in 2020, which reflects a level of prevention and protection approved by insurance companies. And in a  convergent  approach,  the  AVTOVAZ  group  implements  fire protection  and  safety  measures  on  its  sites,  including  insurance against any risks related to the operation of industrial facilities.\n\nFurthermore,  the  entire  Group  is  working  to  increase  its  resilience capacity  in  the  face  of  natural  disasters.  In  particular,  a  specific multi-year  plan  is  being  rolled  out  to  optimize  the  treatment  of seismic  risk  at  the  sites  concerned:  reinforcement  of  buildings  and facilities,  staff  training,  specific  means  of  communication,  crisis management  systems,  business  continuity  and  an  appropriate insurance program.\n\nWith regard to the health crisis, the Group has taken actions, notably through  a  crisis  management  system,  to  protect  the  health  of  its employees,  in  conjunction  with  the  public  authorities,  preserve  its assets  and  its  ability  to  operate,  and  to  adapt  to  changes  in  the situation. The provisions mainly concern specific work organization, management  of  work  interruptions  and  resumptions  in  line  with local measures and commercial demand.\n\n## Risk linked to products and services 1.5.2.3\n\n## Risk of inadequate definition or execution of products and services high risk with impact > probability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  the  continuously  changing  environment  of  the  automotive markets,  regulations,  customer  expectations  and  technologies, linked  to  societal,  environmental  and  climate  issues,  the  Group  is exposed  to  a  risk  of  insufficient  match  between  its  product  and services offering and the expectations of the various markets, which could adversely impact its sales, revenues or income statement.\n\n## Specific risks have been identified relating to:\n\n- the  enhancement  of  the  technological  content  of  vehicles  and P related ecosystems, especially with regard to vehicle connectivity and related services and the development of electrified and, in the longer  term,  autonomous  vehicles  (see  section 1.4.1  'The  car  of the future' of this Document);",

In particular, the choice of hybridization technology, which is particularly sensitive to costs and  offers  differentiated  customer  and  CO2  performances,  could turn  out  to  be  imperfectly  adapted  or  paced,  depending  on  the products and markets, thus potentially going against the overall technological and economic optimization defined by the Group for its CAFE trajectory.\n\nShould  the  reference  assumptions  used  in  the  Group's  product development  decisions  be  strongly  called  into  question  (declining markets,  aid  policies,  segments  or  volumes,  higher  investment  or unit  costs),  the  Group  may  have  to  recognize  impairment  on  fixed assets (investment and capitalized development expenses, depreciated over the life of the vehicle) or book a provision to cover the contractual indemnities to be paid, if any, due to the failure to meet a minimum purchase volume.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe definition of the Group's future products is based on customer studies  and  analyses  of  automotive  competitors,  so  that  market expectations  and  developments  and  industry  trends  can  be identified.  It  is  also  increasingly  informed,  on  a  global  scale,  by anticipatory  technology  watch  by  all  of  the  Group's  development stakeholders, of the automotive industry and beyond.\n\nThe development of new models or components is decided on the basis of this work and an evaluation of the anticipated profitability, calculated over the projected life cycle.\n\nThe  new  brand  organization  announced  on  September  3,  2020 should  make  it  possible  to  better  focus  needs  on  customers  and brands while controlling product diversity.\n\nFrom a general perspective, to ensure the robustness of the product plan and keep risks under control, the Group strives to:\n\n- maximize the distribution of the same model in different markets, P which reduces its exposure to possible fluctuations in one of these markets;\n- offer  a  varied,  balanced  Product  portfolio  that  meets  customer P expectations in different segments and markets, so as to reduce\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nthe risk of dependency on a single market, segment or customer type;\n\n- offer a diversified and adaptable engine portfolio (ICE, electrified, P electric, etc .) to meet customer expectations in different markets and enable potential changes in the engine mix to be supported;\n- develop,  with  its  Alliance  partners,  a  limited  number  of P standardized  technical  platforms  ( e.g. CMF-EV)  to  maximize economies  of  scale  for  component  volumes  and  costs  and facilitate their reuse from one region to another;\n- control the robustness of main product development milestones P so  as  to  secure  the  market  launch  schedule  of  new  products  in particular  by  strengthening  governance  through  the  increased involvement of top management.\n\n## Inadequate innovation risk in relation to market expectations high risk with impact > probability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroupe  Renault  operates  in  markets  where  requirements  are increasing in many areas: regulatory ( e.g. emissions and CO2/Climate),  market  trends  and  customer  expectations  ( e.g. connected  services).  These  requirements  make  it  necessary  to further  develop  technical  innovations,  mainly  in  the  fields  of powertrains, and electronics and software, with substantial investments reflecting long development times before the return on investment (see details of the innovations in chapter 1.4.1 ' The car of the future ' of this Document). At the same time, Groupe Renault intends  to  reduce  its  R&D  spending  from  around  10%  of  revenue currently to less than 8% in 2015 in order to preserve profitability. This dual necessity increases the risk weighing on the choices made about  innovations  and  the  chances  of  seeing  those  innovations match  real  expectations  and  therefore  generate  returns  on investment.\n\n## Risk management\n\nGroupe Renault has reviewed the definition of its entire product and technology development portfolio under the impetus of its new CEO since July 2020. It was also decided to review the organization from the start of 2021, with the establishment of four Business Units in charge of each of the Group's four brands in order to ensure that it matches consumer expectations as closely as possible. These brands are able to make the most relevant choices and trade-offs in order to strengthen their specific identities and can rely on the expertise of the  central  business  lines  and  the  bodies  and  technologies developed  at  the  Alliance  level  or  with  partners  ( e.g. Google).  The group can thus develop products that will offer all types of engines (gasoline,  diesel,  electric  and  electrified,  LPG,  hydrogen),  increased connectivity  for  its  vehicles  and  the  driving  aids  expected  by  its customers. For example, at the end of 2020, the company launched a major  innovation  on  the  hybridization  market  with  the  E-TECH engines, which, in addition to the electric range, will make it possible to  meet  CAFE  regulatory  requirements.  In  addition,  the  MEGANE eVision  will  be  the  first  consumer  vehicle  to  integrate  the  Google automotive platform.\n\nI",

This is done in particular through such measures as enhanced  recall  processes  in  order  to  ensure  the  correction  of quality  problems,  especially  those  that  could  have  potential regulatory or safety consequences.\n\n## Insufficient reinforcement of the Renault brand medium risk\n\nThe  Renault  brand  is  recognized  for  its  products  in  the  small  car segment, with the success of the CLIO and the CAPTUR, and in the electric vehicle segment with the ZOE, which was the biggest-selling electric  vehicle  in  Europe  in  2020.  To  meet  ambitions  for  value creation in the upper segments, particularly the C and C+ segments in line with the strategy announced at the end of 2020, the Renault brand must improve its image with customers in those segments.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe organization set  up  at  the  start  of  2021  with  the  division  into four  Business  Units,  one  of  which  dedicated  to  the  Renault  brand, should  make  it  possible  to  ensure  that  brand  strategy  is  perfectly coordinated and consistent across all business lines from upstream to  downstream,  with  stricter  centralized  governance.  The  Renault brand will be able to rely on the launch of 14 new models in its range by 2025, all of which will be offered in electric or hybrid versions. The refocusing  of  sales  on  value  instead  of  volume,  with  a  precise roll-out  plan  in  the  network,  should  enable  the  image  to  be strengthened to the required level.\n\nI\n\n## Cross-functional risks 1.5.2.4\n\n## Risk of cyberattack and failure of information systems high risk with impact > probability\n\nThe  conduct  of  the  Group's  activities  depends,  continuously  and increasingly,  on  the  proper  functioning  of  its  IT  and  information systems.  Developments  in  the  Group's  strategy  and  its  new challenges (cloud strategy, digitization, Industry 4.0, development of connected services or strengthening of the cybersecurity regulatory environment  in  particular)  are  tending  to  increase  its  exposure  to threats and making cybersecurity a major challenge.\n\nThe main risks that could adversely affect its activities, its systems, or those associated with connected services offered to its customers as part of the Group's product and service offer, are related to:\n\n- cybercrime: global computerized attacks or attacks targeting the P Group's  interests  or,  as  a  side  effect,  national  interests.  These attacks, in a context of strong growth, may aim to access sensitive data  (strategic,  products,  services  or  personal  data),  to  steal  or alter them, to block services or even all of the Group's Information Systems;\n- incidents that could affect the continuity of services hosted in our P infrastructures and those of our partners and suppliers;\n- non-compliance  with  IT  standards  or  practices  required  by P legislation, external authorities or contracts with suppliers.\n\nThe materialization of these risks, despite the continuous strengthening  of  systems  aimed  at  controlling  them,  could  have major financial impacts related to the temporary suspension of the Group's activities - of all types - (revenues, earnings) or to penalties. Adverse impacts could also affect the Group's image, the confidence of third parties and customers toward the Group and its brands.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group's  increased  marketing of connected vehicles and services (see in particular sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2) is accompanied by the emergence of risks of a comparable nature, for which insufficiently robust and sustainable management could lead to adverse impacts on safety and the reliability of data, services or vehicles.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  general  control  of  these  risks  is  currently  provided  at  an operational level by:\n\n- the  deployment  of  Group  security  policies  and  the  continuous P enrichment  of  the  process  of  defining  security  requirements according  to  the  level  of  criticality  of  the  applications  and  data handled;\n- the  deployment  of  an  evolving  action  plan  based  on  a  security P master plan and an annual risk mapping. The security master plan was  updated  and  presented  to  the  Audit,  Risks  and  Compliance Committee (CARC) in 2020;\n- the establishment of insurance coverage for cybersecurity. P",

These differences in anticipation or failure to account for such changes in laws  or  regulations  could  result,  for  the  Group  and  its  senior executives, in possible criminal, administrative or financial penalties, that  could  also  lead,  for  the  Group,  to  a  change  in  its  capacity  to carry out its operating activities, its revenues, its profits or its image.\n\n## Risk management\n\nConcerning such legal and regulatory changes, Renault requires its subsidiaries to comply with the regulations of the countries in which the  company  conducts  its  business  and  takes  part  in  on  going discussions with the national or regional authorities in charge of the specific regulation of the products in the automotive sector, in order to anticipate changes and guarantee compliance of the Group with laws and regulations.\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe  Group  uses  a  structured  approach  to  analyze  and  ensure  the robustness  of  its  regulatory  compliance  in  a  sustainable  and pro-active  manner,  over  a  scope  of  major  regulated  domains, including  in  particular:  'competition',  'fight  against  fraud  and corruption',  'environment',  'occupational  health,  safety,  work environment', 'technical regulations', \"data protection\", etc .\n\nThis approach  is managed  by  the  Ethics  and  Compliance department, working closely with the Legal department, under the supervision of the Ethics and Compliance Committee (CEC).\n\n## Legal risk medium risk\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  exposed  to  a  legal  risk  induced  by  two components,  the  evaluation  and  potential  impacts  of  which  are detailed below.\n\nThe  Group  uses  a  global  assessment  of  these  components  in  its criticality analysis. These are presented without prioritization in the following description.\n\n## Disputes, governmental or legal proceedings, arbitration\n\nRenault  is  involved  in  various  governmental,  legal  and  arbitration proceedings as part of its activities in France and internationally.\n\nTo the best of Renault's knowledge, over the last 12 months there has been no dispute or governmental or legal proceeding other than those  described  below  or  arbitration  process  underway  or  likely  to occur  and  that  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  its  financial position,  activities  or  results.  Each  event  was  reviewed  regularly  in particular during approval of the financial statements. After seeking the  opinion  of  the  appropriate  advisers,  the  Group  sets  aside  any provisions  deemed  necessary  to  cover  the  estimated  risks  (see note 20 'Provisions' to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nIt should be noted, however, that, concurrently with the works of the independent  technical  commission  ('Royal'  commission  in  2016), the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R\u00e9pression  des  Fraudes  (DGCCRF)  conducted  investigations concerning the automotive industry. These investigations concerned the  practices  relating  to  the  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  (NOx)  of  a dozen car manufacturers selling diesel vehicles in France, including Groupe  Renault.  The  DGCCRF  decided  to  communicate  its conclusions  on  this  matter  to  the  public  prosecutor  who,  on January 12,  2017,  opened  judicial  investigations  on  the  grounds  of aggravated  deception  in  respect  of  the  substantive  nature  and controls conducted. Renault contests the existence of any infringement and intends to prove its compliance with French and European  regulations  in  the  legal  investigation.  Moreover,  Groupe Renault,  which  at  this  stage  is  not  a  party  to  the  proceeding,  is therefore  not  in  a  position  to  assess  the  possible  impact  of  this ongoing proceeding on the Group.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nRenault's industrial know-how, innovations resulting from research, and the products marketed are the subject of patents, trademarks, designs and models filed to protect the Group's intellectual property. As  such,  Groupe  Renault  files  a  significant  number  of  patents, trademarks, designs and models in its area of activity each year (see chapter 1.4 of this Document). The major risk facing Groupe Renault in terms of intellectual property is the risk of counterfeiting, whether suffered or active.",

From  a  technological  standpoint,  given  Groupe  Renault's reputation, particularly in the field of hybrid and electric vehicles, the Group  could  become  a  prime  target  for  such  counterfeiting. Renault's  E-TECH  technology  is  a  significant  example.  As  regards trademarks,  designs  and  models,  repercussions  can  be  felt  in particular  in  the  replacement  market.  Groupe  Renault's  existing reputation  is  a  key  factor  in  increasing  the  risk  of  counterfeiting, particularly in Europe and the Middle-East.\n\nAny  such  actions  could  have  an  immediate  unfavorable  impact  on the  Group's  revenues  and  earnings,  and  may  harm  the  reputation and  quality  image  of  the  technologies  and  products  concerned. Patents,  trademarks,  designs  and  models  registered  by  Renault  in the  Group's  main  automotive  markets  provide  it  with  an  effective weapon in the fight against counterfeiting. In addition, with regard to trademarks, the establishment of customs monitoring in various countries allows the reporting of dubious products, both imports and exports.\n\nSo-called active infringement could be an involuntary act by Renault, given the risk associated with the time period during which patent applications are not made public. Patent applications filed by third parties  and  known  only  at  the  time  of  publication  could  force Renault  to  modify  a  product  under  development,  increasing  the project's Research and Development costs, or to negotiate rights to use the patented item. In either case, the project's margin would be affected.  This  risk  is  particularly  present  in  the  context  of connectivity and standard essential patents.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  control  of  legal  risks  is  in  particular  based  upon  an  internal control system organized around three guiding principles:\n\n- management  of  the  Group's  legal  function,  which  is  organized P around  a  central  function  and  employees  in  the  Group's  main countries.  These  employees  report  on  a  hierarchical  and/or functional basis;\n- employees of the legal function are proactive in anticipating legal P risks  upstream  and  adapting  the  corresponding  procedures (advisory  consultations,  information  from  the  central  legal function, etc .);\n- regulatory monitoring by Groupe Renault in collaboration with the P different countries concerned.\n\nI\n\n## Financial risks 1.5.2.5\n\nGroupe Renault is exposed to the following six main risk components of  a  financial  nature,  the  assessment,  potential  impacts  and principles of control of which are specified below.\n\n## Liquidity risk high risk with impact > probability\n\nThe Group depends on access to resources in the financial markets. It finances its Automotive and Sales Financing activities through the issuance  of  long-term  debt  and  commercial  paper,  bank  loans  and through  the  securitization  of  receivables  and  deposit-gathering activities. In the event of prolonged market closures or pressure on access to credit, the Group is exposed to liquidity risk. If the Group's funding  requirements  increase  or  if  the  Group  is  unable  to  access new sources  of  funding,  insufficient  liquidity  would  be  particularly detrimental  to  its  competitiveness,  operating  results  and  financial position.  Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  of  the  automotive  and  sales financing segments experiencing reduced liquidity to repay debts as they  fall  due  or  to  finance  balance  sheet  growth.  The  Group's liquidity could be significantly affected by factors beyond its control, such  as  general  market  disruptions,  the  market's  perception  of increased liquidity risk or speculative pressure in the debt market.\n\nIn  2020,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  caused  general  market disruption  with  a  downward  impact  on  the  Group's  activity,  which adversely affected its working capital requirement.\n\nThe  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  segments  are  also  rated  by several agencies. Any downgrading of their ratings could limit and/or increase  the  cost  of  access  to  the  capital  markets  for  these  Group segments. Under current market conditions, a possible downgrading of Renault SA's credit rating (Automotive segment) by Moody's and S&P would result in the downgrading of RCI Banque (Sales Financing segment).\n\nThe table  of  Renault  SA's  credit  ratings  is  presented  below  (dated March  11,  2021),  together  with  its  bond,  bank  and  similar  debt maturity schedule as at December 31, 2020:\n\n## RENAULT SA RATINGS\n\n| Agency   | Rating & Perspective    | Date            |\n|----------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n| Moody's  | Ba2/NP/Negative Outlook | May 28, 2020    |\n| S&P      | BB+/B/Negative Outlook* | March 5, 2021   |\n| R&I      | A-/Negative Outlook**   | March 11, 2021  |\n| JCR      | A-/Negative Outlook     | October 5, 2020 |\n\n- Rating affirmed on March 5, 2021. *\n- Rating affirmed on March 11, 2021. **",

This  management  is based  on  an  internal  model  that  defines  the  level  of  the  liquidity reserve that the Automotive segment must maintain to finance its activity and its growth. The liquidity reserve level of the Automotive division  is  subject  to  close  monthly  monitoring,  through  a  periodic review  and  reporting  validated  internally  by  the  Chief  Financial Officer.  Oversight  and  management  of  the  liquidity  reserve  level were strengthened in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTo finance the liquidity requirements stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic,  Renault  SA  entered  into  a  \u20ac5  billion  bank  credit agreement in June 2020, backed by a French State guarantee. This credit facility, which may be used in whole or in part and in one or more installments  only  until  December  31,  2020,  was  drawn  three times  in  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac4  billion  (see  note  23-C  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nIn 2020, Renault SA also maintained its access to the capital markets by  issuing  a  new  Eurobond  under  its  EMTN  program  (\u20ac1  billion, maturity  five  and  a  half  years)  on  November  25  and  its  access  to short-term financing thanks to its NEU CP program. The contractual documentation  for  this  funding,  including  bank  loans  and  credit lines, does not contain any clause that might adversely affect credit availability or continuation as a result of a change in Renault's credit rating or its compliance with financial ratios.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Automotive segment's liquidity reserve (including  AVTOVAZ) stood at \u20ac16.4 billion, enabling it to meet its commitments in the coming 12 months. It breaks down as \u20ac12.95 billion in cash and cash equivalents and \u20ac3.43 billion in committed bank credit lines, which remained unused at December 31, 2020.\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nFor  the  Sales  Financing  segment, liquidity  risk  management  is based  on  several  indicators  or  analyses,  updated  monthly  on  the basis  of  the  latest  estimates  of  outstanding  loans  and  actual refinancing transactions. Laws relating to the outflow of deposits are subject to conservative assumptions. The Group has limits governing its  liquidity  risk.  RCI  Banque  must  always  have  sufficient  financial resources  to  ensure  the  long-term  future  of  its  business  and development.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  RCI  Banque's  liquidity reserve (European scope) stood at \u20ac16.6 billion, enabling it to ensure the  continuity  of  its  commercial  activity  for  more  than  12  months without access to external liquidity (centralized refinancing scope). It comprises \u20ac4.5 billion in undrawn confirmed bank lines, \u20ac4.5 billion in  collateral  eligible  for  the  ECB's  monetary  policy  operations, \u20ac7.4 billion in high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs), and \u20ac0.3 billion in short-term financial assets. As of December 31, 2020, RCI Banque's liquidity reserve (European scope) stood at \u20ac16.6 billion, an increase of \u20ac7.1 billion compared to end 2019.\n\nFor more details on the liquidity risk management system, see note 25-B1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk medium risk\n\nThe  international  expansion  of  its  activities  leaves  the  Group exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk.  This  risk  is  related  to  the fluctuation  of  the  various  currencies  against  the  euro,  and mainly impacts the Group's Automotive activity.\n\nThe  operating  margin  and  working  capital  requirement  constitute the Automotive segment's main exposure to foreign exchange risk, with  the  policy  being  not  to  hedge  future  operating  cash  flows  in foreign  currencies.  Based  on  the  structure  of  its  results  and operating cash flows for 2020, an increase of 1% in the euro against all  currencies  would  have  a  negative  impact  of  \u20ac24  million  on  the Automotive  division's  annual  operating  margin  after  hedging (detailed  impact  by  currency  in  note 25-B2  of  the  notes  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nNet  financial  income,  the  share  in  the  result  of  associated companies, shareholders' equity and the net cash position may also be  impacted  by  exchange  rate  fluctuations  against  the  euro.  In particular, the Group has a stake of 43.7% in Nissan, and therefore holds a net asset in yen whose fluctuations impact the value of the securities in assets and the Group's translation reserves in liabilities. For the 2020 financial year, the impact of a 1% increase in the euro against  the  yen  would  represent  a  \u20ac137.5  million  reduction  in Nissan's  contribution  to  shareholders'  equity  and  a  \u20ac49  million reduction  in  the  Group's  income  from  associated  companies  (see notes  12-C  ad  12-D  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements).  The Group  partially  hedges  the  foreign  exchange  risk  related  to  its investment  in  Nissan  by  issuing  loans  in  Japanese  yen,  which impacts its net cash position. Thus, a 1% rise in the euro against the yen would increase the net cash position by \u20ac1.4 million.\n\nThe Sales Financing segment is exposed to a more limited extent to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which may nevertheless have a negative impact on its financial position.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the Automotive  segment foreign  exchange  risk  management  policy  (excluding  AVTOVAZ) are  ensured  by the  Financing  and  Treasury  department.  Any exceptional hedging of foreign exchange risk in the operating margin and working capital requirement must be subject to prior analysis by the Finance and Treasury department and then formally authorized by the Finance department or Senior Management, and the results are then reported monthly to the Chief Financial Officer. Whenever possible,  foreign  exchange  transactions  are  carried  out  by  the Group's  trading  room  (Renault  Finance)  for  currencies  traded  on international markets.\n\nIn  2020,  in  order  to  limit  the  exposure  of  its  operating  margin  and working  capital  to  foreign  exchange  risk,  the  Automotive  segment (excluding AVTOVAZ) set up currency hedges on the pound sterling, the Argentinian peso and the Turkish lira.\n\nIn  addition,  to  avoid  any  distortion  of  the  financial  result  linked  to foreign  exchange  fluctuations,  the  exchange  rate  risk  linked  to financing  and  cash  management  flows  in  foreign  currencies  is systematically minimized. Cash surpluses recorded in countries that are not part of the parent company's centralized cash management are generally invested in local currency, under the supervision of the Financing  and  Treasury  department.  Financing  transactions  are carried out in the accounting currency of each entity, or when carried out in foreign currencies, are hedged in the same currency under the supervision  of  the  Financing  and  Treasury  department.  Residual exposures (including those resulting from Renault Finance operations) are subject to derogations and are reported monthly to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nEquity investments in currencies other than the euro are not usually hedged. This may lead to translation adjustments, which the Group recognizes  in  shareholders'  equity.  However,  given  the  size  of  the investment in Nissan, Renault's share in Nissan's net worth has been partially  covered  by  a  specific  foreign  exchange  hedge  (see note 12-G to the consolidated financial statements). To limit liquidity risks in yen, the Group has set itself the rule of not hedging the net investment above an amount equal to its best estimate of the next three years' dividends in yen to be received from Nissan.\n\nAVTOVAZ manages exchange rate risk in a very similar way to the Automotive segment excluding AVTOVAZ. The process is overseen by  AVTOVAZ's  Finance  department.  It  identifies,  assesses  and manages  the  exchange  risk  by  analyzing  the  net  position  in  each currency. No exchange rate risk hedging operations were carried out in 2020. AVTOVAZ's surplus cash and bank financings at December 31, 2020 were almost entirely denominated in Russian rubles.\n\nRCI Banque 's sales financing subsidiaries are required to refinance in their  local  currencies  and  therefore  have  no  foreign  exchange exposure. No foreign currency exposure is allowed in respect of RCI Banque refinancing, the trading room being used to ensure that all flows  are  hedged.  RCI  Banque's  residual  exposure  for  other  assets and liabilities ( e.g. accrued interest not yet due on foreign currency borrowings) is kept at a marginal level. Equity and annual earnings for  RCI  Banque  subsidiaries  outside  the  euro  zone  are  themselves subject  to  foreign  exchange  movements  and  are  not  specifically hedged. At December 31, 2020, the RCI Banque group's consolidated foreign exchange position amounted to \u20ac5.8 million.\n\nFor further details on the management of foreign exchange risk, see note 25-B2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI\n\n## Customer and network credit risk medium risk\n\nThe  Group's  sales  financing  activity  is  exposed  to  customer  and dealer  network  credit  risk  if  its  risk  management  techniques  are insufficient to protect it from the default of its counterparties.\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of losses due to the incapacity of RCI Banque customers to fulfill the terms of a contract signed with the company. Credit risk is closely linked to macroeconomic factors that include,  among  others,  the  unemployment  rate,  business  failures, debt service charges, income growth, disposable household income, dealer profitability and used vehicle prices. It has a significant impact on its business. The level of credit risk of RCI Banque's customers is affected by the overall macroeconomic situation, which may affect the ability of some of its customers to meet their repayments. The level of credit risk on the dealer networks is impacted, among other things,  by  their  financial  strength,  the  quality  of  their  guarantees and overall vehicle demand. An increase in credit risk would increase the  cost  of  risk  and  provisions  for  credit  losses,  and  would  have  a direct  impact  on  RCI  Banque's  financial  results  and  potentially  its internal capital.\n\nThe  cost  of  risk  on  customer  activity  (individuals  and  company financing)  rose  in  2020.  It  is  impacted  by  the  lock-down  policies negative consequences on several sectors of the economy, namely : an increase of the provision booked for corporate customers on an individual  basis,  an  adjustment  of  the  respective  weight  of  the macro-economic scenarios resulting in an increase of the provision booked  under  the  forward-looking  IFRS  9,  and  the  booking  of collective  provisions  on  debtors  operating  in  sectors  strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRCI  Banque  uses  advanced  credit  scoring  systems  and  queries external databases to assess the quality of loans to individuals and businesses.  The  Group  also  uses  an  internal  rating  system  to evaluate  dealer  loans.  Although  RCI  Banque  continually  adjusts  its lending policy to take market conditions into account, an increase in credit  risk  would  increase  its  cost  of  risk  and  provisions  for  credit losses.  RCI  Banque  implements  detailed  procedures  to  ensure  the recovery  of  debts  incurred  or  otherwise  organizes  the  recovery  of unpaid vehicles and the sale of repossessed vehicles. However, there can be no assurance that the lending policy, credit risk monitoring, collection  activities,  recording  of  accounts  receivable  or  vehicle repossessions are or will be sufficient to prevent an adverse effect on  its  results  and  financial  position.  In  2020,  in  anticipation  of  the deterioration  in  economic  conditions  linked  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic, RCI Banque adjusted its lending policy in line with the risk observed, and forecasts and stress in the main countries by market (individuals,  companies).  As  a  result,  additional  controls  have  been implemented,  with  specific  granting  policies  for  each  business segment (corporate client or employer of a particular client), pricing has been increased, mainly in South American countries and regions, and  default  probability  targets  have  been  adjusted  down.  In addition,  following  the  first  period  of  lockdown,  RCI  Banque increased  the  number  of  employees  dedicated  to  the  recovery  of non-performing and doubtful receivables, and additional staff were assigned  in  countries  that  have  granted  a  significant  number  of deferred payments.",

At December  31,  2020,  net  customer  assets  amounted  to  \u20ac38,301 million and net dealer assets to \u20ac8,894 million.\n\nFor further details on customer and network credit risk management,  see  note  25-B6  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Bank counterparty risk medium risk\n\nAs a result of its transactions in the financial and banking markets for the investment of its cash surpluses, for the management of its foreign exchange and interest rate risk, and for the management of its settlement flows, the Group is exposed to bank counterparty risk. This risk corresponds to the non-recovery of the capital committed as a deposit or cash investment transaction recorded among assets, or  the  possible  impossibility  of  returning  to  market  conditions (interest  rates,  exchange  rates)  equivalent  to  those  of  the  initial conditions for the use of derivative instruments. The counterparty's default could have a negative financial impact on Groupe Renault.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  management  of  the  bank  counterparty  risk  of  the  Group's various  entities  is  fully  coordinated  between  the  Automotive  and Sales Financing segments. It is based on an internal rating system that mainly takes into account counterparties' long-term ratings and the  level  of  their  shareholders  equity.  This  system  is  used  by  all Groupe Renault companies exposed to counterparty risk.\n\nSome  Group  companies  have  significant  exposure  to  counterparty risk  owing  to  the  nature  of  their  business.  These  companies  are monitored daily to ensure that they comply with authorized limits by counterparty,  in  accordance  with  specific  procedures.  The  Group produces  a  consolidated  monthly  report  covering  all  its  bank counterparties,  organized  by  credit  rating.  This  report  provides  a detailed  analysis  of  compliance  with  limits  in  terms  of  amount, maturity and type, as well as a list of the main exposures.\n\nTo reduce bank counterparty risk, most deposits are made with large network  banks  and  generally  have  terms  shorter  than  90  days,  as this  allows  a  good  spread  of  the  risk  and  lowers  the  systemic  risk. Due  to  the  international  expansion  of  its  business  activities, including in emerging countries, the Group pays special attention to the choice of its counterparties in each banking system. In 2020, the Group suffered no financial loss as a result of the failure of a banking counterparty.\n\nFor  more  details  on  the  bank  counterparty  risk  management system, see note 25-B6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Interest rate risk medium risk\n\nExposure to interest rate risk relates mainly to the Sales Financing segment,  for  which  this  risk  represents  the  impact  of  a  change  in interest  rates  on  future  financial  gross  margin.  RCI  Banque's operating profit may be affected by changes in market interest rates or rates on customer deposits.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment monitors  interest  rate  risk  daily: sensitivity  is  calculated  by  currency,  by  management  entity  and  by asset portfolio, thus verifying that each entity respects its individual imposed limits. Sensitivity to interest rate risk is measured using the same  methodology  throughout  all  RCI  Banque  entities.  The sensitivity  consists  of  measuring  the  impact  of  a  100 bps  rise  in interest  rates  on  the  value  of  balance  sheet  flows  for  each  entity. The  hedging  system  enables  RCI  Banque's  overall  exposure  to  be reduced as well as that of each entity. At December 31, 2020, after hedging,  RCI  Banque's  overall  sensitivity  to  interest  rate  risk  was \u20ac5.8 million below the limit set by the Group (\u20ac50 million).\n\nFor the Automotive segment , cash reserves are generally built up at variable  rates,  and  long-term  investments  in  the  Automotive segment  excluding  AVTOVAZ  are  generally  financed  at  fixed  rates (fixed-rate borrowings are maintained at fixed rates as long as the yield  curve  is  close  to  zero  or  even  negative).  The  Automotive segment  available  cash  is  centralized,  as  far  as  possible,  within Renault SA, and invested in the form of short-term bank deposits by Renault  Finance.  AVTOVAZ's  cash  surpluses  and  bank  debt  are mainly  indexed  at  floating  rates.  AVTOVAZ  did  not  set  up  any interest  rate  hedging  instruments  on  its  financial  debt  in  2020. AVTOVAZ's  Finance  department  closely  monitors  interest  rate trends  in  Russia  and,  in  the  event  of  a  rise  in  interest  rates,  could take  measures  to  reduce  the  impact  on  its  financial  result  by increasing  the  proportion  of  fixed-rate  debt  as  its  portfolio  is refinanced.\n\nFor further details on interest rate risk management, see note 25-B3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk of decrease in residual values medium risk\n\nThe Group's Sales Financing activity may be exposed to a risk of a decrease  in  residual  values  when  vehicles  are  financed  with  a buy-back  commitment  and  do  not  benefit  from  a  buy-back agreement  from  a  third  party  and/or  when  a  customer  does  not exercise a purchase option. If the value of the vehicle is less than the residual value defined in the financing contract, the holder of these residual  values  incurs  a  loss  when  the  vehicle  is  sold.  Changes  in prices on the used vehicle market can entail a risk for the owner of residual values, who is committed to taking back the vehicle at the end of its lease at a price fixed when the contracts are put in place. This risk could have a negative impact on the company's operating results and financial position due to the recognition of higher-than-expected losses.\n\nI",

The  Group  constantly  ensures  that  it  has  appropriate tools to enable it to respond to these requirements.\n\nThe  regulatory  framework  of  the  European  Union,  which  is applicable by extension to around 40 countries geographically in or close  to  Europe,  allows  approval  granted  in  one  European  Union country on the basis of a common list of technical regulations to be recognized in another European Union country and registration in all European Union countries without additional technical constraints.\n\nThe European framework is historically the pioneer of many national technical  regulations  around  the  world.  It  is  based  in  particular  on regulation (EU) no. 2018/858 on the approval and market oversight of engine vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles ,  amended by regulation  (EU)  no.  2019/2144  of  November  27,  2019  on type-approval requirements for engine vehicles and their trailers, and  systems,  components  and  separate  technical  units  intended for  such  vehicles,  as  regards  their  general  safety  and  the protection  of  vehicle  occupants  and  vulnerable  road  users ,  called the 'General Safety Regulation' (GSR), which has reinforced approval checks  and  production  process  controls,  as  well  as  statistical  and continuous  oversight  of  vehicles  placed  on  the  market  and  many passive and active safety technical requirements from 2022.\n\nCarmakers, and more generally the automotive sector, are involved in  this  continued  strengthening  of  European  technical  regulations, within the framework of working groups organized by the European Commission and made up of the industries involved in the Member States.  The  automotive  sector  is  also  involved  within  the  broader framework  of  the  UN  working  groups,  made  up  of  around  60 countries  and  international  organizations  (including  the  European Union),  to  ensure  regulatory  changes  are  made  while  taking  into account  technical  and  industrial  challenges  and  opportunities,  as well as implementation deadlines.\n\nIt should be noted that the health situation in 2020 resulted in very few delays or discrepancies in the preparation or application dates of regulatory  texts,  nor  did  it  have  a  significant  influence  on  the determination of the levels of regulatory requirements, whether in terms  of  active  and  passive  safety  or  in  terms  of  emissions  and pollutants.\n\n## Pollutant emissions and CO2 1.6.1.2\n\nIn  the  last  few  years  there  has  been  a  considerable  change  in regulatory requirements  set  out  on  pollutant  emissions  by regulation (EC) no. 715/2007 on type-approval of engine vehicles with  respect  to  emissions  from  passenger  and  light  commercial vehicles  (Euro  5  and  Euro  6)  and  on  vehicle  repair  and maintenance information , supplemented by Commission regulation (EU) no. 2017/1151 of June 1, 2017.\n\nSince  September 1,  2018,  the  pollutants  of  all  new  passenger  cars (PC)  and  light  commercial  vehicles  (LCV)  are  measured  using  the Euro 6 and CO2 limits, during a new cycle that is more representative of  use,  called  the  WLTP  (Worldwide  harmonized  Light  Duty  Test Procedure).  The  WLTP  was  implemented  one  year  later  for  new, heavier LCVs.\n\nIn addition to WLTP, which measures pollutants in the laboratory, a procedure known as RDE (Real Driving Emissions) was introduced in two stages, after an initial monitoring phase. This procedure makes it  possible  to  verify  emissions  under  almost  all  conditions  of  use (driving, road profiles, weather, etc .).\n\nThe first  interim  stage,  called  Euro  6d  TEMP,  sets  controls  for  NOx (nitrogen  oxide)  emissions  using  a  compliance  factor  of  2.1  and particles  by  number  (PN)  using  a  compliance  factor  of  1.5,  taking measurement  uncertainties  into  account.  Euro  6d  TEMP  has  been applicable to all new PCs and small LCVs since January 1, 2019 and to all heavy LCVs from January 1, 2020.\n\nA  second  step,  known  as  Euro  6d,  provides  for  reducing  this compliance factor to 1.00 for NOx and PR, and takes into account a measurement uncertainty margin of 0.43 for NOx and 0.5 for PR, it being specified that the latter factor will be revised each year in the light  of  progress  in  the  Portable  Emissions  Measurement  System (PEMS)  procedure  and  equipment.  Euro  6d  has  been  applicable  to new models since January 1, 2020, and will be applicable to all PCs and  small  LCVs,  as  well  as  heavy  LCVs  from  January  1,  2021  and lastly to all heavy LCVs from January 1, 2022.\n\nIn  addition to these regulations, which apply to exhaust emissions, evaporative  emissions  from  the  fuel  systems  of  gasoline  vehicles have also been reduced through a stricter procedure applicable to all new vehicles since September 1, 2019.\n\nThe (CE) 'emissions' regulation 715/2007 does not confine itself to approval  of  new  products  but  also  requires  the  inspection  of customer vehicles  by  the  manufacturer  and  by  any  Member  State. This is one of the few industries that produces consumer goods for which vehicle inspection is required at between six months and five years, or 15,000 km and 100,000 km.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT\n\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe  next  major  regulatory  deadline  is  Euro  7.  The  European Commission  has  commissioned  a  consortium  of  consultants  to develop  a  substantiated  proposal  for  the  Euro  7  technical requirements.\n\nThe  co-decision  proposal  to  be  submitted  to  the  European Parliament and the Council is expected in the final months of 2021. The Commission's aim is for Euro 7 to be the last step before zero emissions.\n\nThe health situation did not have a significant impact on regulatory requirements in terms of emissions, either on their content or their timing.\n\nFurthermore, (EU) regulation 2019/631, which lays down performance  standards  for  CO2  emissions, is applicable  to passenger  cars  as  well  as  to  new  light  commercial  vehicles.  It represents  a  very  important  component  of  climate  protection  in Europe.\n\n(EU)  regulation  333/2014  had  stipulated  a  limit  of  95g  of  CO2/km applicable to 95% of the passenger car fleet starting from 2020.\n\nStarting  from  2021,  (EU)  regulation  no.  2019/631  defines  the objectives  to  be  achieved  up  to  2030.  This  regulation  stipulates achievement  by  2025  of  a  reduction  of  15%  compared  to  a  start point  calculated  in  2021,  and  in  2030,  a  reduction  of  37.5% compared  to  this  same  start  point.  These  objectives  cannot  be achieved  without  a  significant  increase  in  the  share  of  hybrid  and electric cars in the Renault range. In addition, regulation no. 2019/631 introduces an incentive to exceed a minimum level of zero- or low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs) as a percentage of the range in 2025 and 2030.\n\nThe same principles apply to light commercial vehicles, with a target of 147g of CO2/km in 2020 and ambitions for a reduction of 15% in 2025 and 31% in 2030, compared to a base defined in 2021.\n\nIn  2020, following the European Union's decision to make a strong commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050, we can expect to see a significant increase in CO2 emissions targets (from -37.5% to -50% for passenger cars for instance) for the transport segment. This risk is monitored closely, and the possible tightening is already included in Renault's scenarios.\n\nRegulation no. 2019/631 also stipulates a penalty of \u20ac95 per gram of CO2  and  per  vehicle  sold  in  the  event  of  failure  to  achieve  the abovementioned  objectives.  However,  this  regulation  provides  a certain amount of flexibility, such as the possibility of forming a pool between  manufacturers,  and  benefiting  from  gains  made  through eco-innovations or vehicles with zero and very low consumption.\n\nThe  2023  revision  clause  introduced  into  regulation  no.  2019/631 lays down the principle of setting new objectives for 2035 and 2040, in order to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050.\n\nThis  desire  to  combat  global  warming  is  found  in  other  countries where Renault operates, such as China, Brazil and India. In addition, China  in  particular  has  comprehensive  regulations  for  electric vehicles (pure and hybrid electric).\n\nI\n\n## Passive safety and active safety 1.6.1.3\n\nThe  entry  into  force  of (EU)  regulation  no.  2019/2144  concerning the  requirements  for  approval  relating  to  the  general  safety  of motor  vehicles,  their  trailers  and  systems,  parts  and  separate technical  entities  that  are  intended  for  them , will require manufacturers to incorporate an entire series of safety systems and to  design  the  structure  of  new  vehicles  taking  into  account  new requirements  aimed  at  minimizing  the  severity  of  accidents  in head-on, side and rear impact collisions.\n\n## Passive safety 1.6.1.3.1\n\nAll newly approved PCs and small LCVs from July 2022 will have to meet new requirements for head-on, side and rear impact collisions. The requirements will be applicable to all newly registered vehicles in the European Union from July 2024.\n\nTwo  years  after  these  dates,  new  requirements  for  the  safety  of pedestrians will apply to the front end of these vehicles, in order to extend the protection zones up to the windscreen.\n\n## Active safety 1.6.1.3.2\n\nFrom July 2022, all newly approved PCs and small LCVs (classes M1 and N1) will be required to be equipped during manufacture with:\n\n- an AEB (Advanced Emergency Braking) system to reduce the risk P of collision with other vehicles, whether stationary or in motion;\n- an Emergency Lane Keeping system that brings vehicles back into P their  lane  before  an  involuntary  crossing  (without  indicator signals) of an unbroken line and alerts drivers in the event of an involuntary crossing of a broken line;\n- an  Intelligent  Speed  Adaptation  system  capable  of  alerting  the P driver when vehicle speed exceeds the limits;\n- a Driver Drowsiness & Attention Warning system, which should be P based on analysis of activity at the steering wheel, pedals, etc .\n\nThese  advanced  driver  aid  systems  (ADAS)  will  become  obligatory from  July  2024  for  all  newly  registered  vehicles  in  the  European Union.\n\nTwo years after these dates, new ADAS will become mandatory in turn, such as the AEB system, which takes pedestrians and cyclists into account, and the Advanced Driver Distraction Warning system, which will require technologies that use cameras and image analysis algorithms.\n\nFrom  July  2022,  all  newly  approved  PCs  and  commercial  vehicles (LCVs and public transit) must, depending on their PC, public transit, light  LCV  or  heavy  LCV  category,  be  equipped  with  pedestrian  and cyclist  proximity  detection  and/or  vision  systems  on  the  front,  side and rear of the vehicle.\n\nThese systems will become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.",

These  requirements  will become effective in July 2022 for newly approved vehicles and in July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\nThese new provisions require manufacturers to put in place a very well  structured  Cyber  Security  Management  System  to  ensure traceability  and  transparency  for  all  decisions  and  approvals  in respect  of  the  inspection  authorities  and  require  incorporation  in vehicles of state-of-the-art technical solutions to limit cyber risks as soon as these are designed.\n\nVarious countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Turkey and Israel, will adopt similar requirements with the same timelines.\n\n## Autonomous and/or connected 1.6.1.3.4 vehicles\n\nAlthough  not  a  compulsory  feature,  regulations  for  vehicles  with driverless  operation  services  should,  in  the  initial  stages,  cover systems that help drivers to stay in lane, to drive in congested traffic and on highways (Advanced Lane Keeping Systems).\n\nExtensions  to  more  ambitious  use  cases  should  become  reality  by 2030.\n\n\"Driverless\"  vehicles  are  a  special  case  that  will  undoubtedly  be handled  through  testing  carried  out  at  the  national  level,  and authorizations issued locally, for public transport and other uses.\n\nIn parallel, the rules of the road would gradually have to be changed in order to authorize the use of these autonomous driving systems. Thus,  the  amendment  of  the  Vienna  Convention  on  Road  Traffic, which was adopted in 2020 and will be formalized in 2021, paves the way for these developments.\n\nConnectivity is also a special case, insofar as it calls on a number of players outside the automotive sector.\n\n## Prohibited substances and materials and 1.6.1.4 recycling\n\nThe so-called \"substances\" regulation governs the registration of all substances  and  materials  present  in  vehicles  and  sets  out prohibitions and limitations of these substances and materials, with monitoring  of  each  vehicle  to  avoid  distribution  on  the  market  of harmful or prohibited products and facilitate recycling of end-of-life vehicles and their batteries.\n\nGlobal guidelines on regulatory substances and recycling are mainly set by the European Union.\n\nThey  include  the  European  regulations  REACH,  POP  (persistent organic pollutants), and biocidal products for substances, the F-GAS regulation and the Air Conditioning Systems Directive on greenhouse gas emissions for air conditioning system fluids, and the ELV and recyclability directives on end-of-life treatment of vehicles and recycling (minimum recyclability and recovery quotas and limits on certain substances or prohibition of certain hazardous materials in recycled materials), as well as the introduction of environmental performance obligations over the entire life cycle of vehicles.\n\nThe European Commission's Green Deal will prompt many changes to vehicle design in the coming five to 10 years. These changes are expected  to  result  in  a  sharp  increase  in  the  number  of  banned substances,  the  extension  of  end-of-life  treatment  to  large commercial  vehicles,  with  requirements  on  the  recycled  plastic content  of  vehicles  and  stricter  requirements  for  the  performance, durability  and  recyclability  of  batteries,  together  with  ethical  rules on  sourcing  and,  as  for  vehicles,  requirements  on  the  recycled content of batteries.\n\nOther  countries  such  as  China,  Korea,  and  Japan  could  also  adopt specific  requirements  for  the  emissions  of  materials  present  in vehicles to guarantee passenger cabin air quality.\n\n## Stronger oversight 1.6.1.5\n\nThe  unique  legal  environment  in  European  Union  Member  States shows  a  general  trend  toward  more  stringent  requirements  and oversight of them by regulatory authorities, whether through stricter monitoring  of  approval  tests,  maintaining  the  performance  of vehicles  throughout  their  life  via  engine  compliance  inspections, maintaining the general condition of the rolling vehicle population via  reinforced  technical  controls,  enhanced  verification  of  the compliance  of  production  (COP)  and  monitoring  the  compliance  of new vehicles put on the market.\n\nFor  example,  through  the  new  EU  Regulation 2018/858,  the European  Union  has  decided  to  implement  market  oversight  from September 2020 that consists of requiring each Member State of the European  Union  to  conduct  vehicle  compliance  inspections  that include  performance  of  approval  tests  on  a  sample  of  vehicles representative of their national market. Another purpose of market oversight is the monitoring of the functioning of technical services and approval authorities in each European Union Member State to detect and correct malfunctions in the European approval system.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Environmental regulations 1.6.2\n\nAs  part  of  its  production  of  automotive  vehicles  and  mechanical equipment and the sale of its products, Groupe Renault is required, in the various countries where its vehicles and products are located or  marketed,  to  comply  with  certain  regulations  that  are  directly applicable to it, in particular with regard to the sites and installations it  operates  and  the  substances  used  as  part  of  its  production process.\n\nBecause of its activities, Groupe Renault is subject to environmental regulations,  concerning,  among other areas, emissions into the air, waste management, and water and soil impacts.\n\nThe  main  regulations  applicable  to  Groupe  Renault's  industrial, logistics and commercial activities are described below.\n\n## Industrial emissions management 1.6.2.1\n\nDirective  no. 2010/75  of  November 24,  2010,  known  as  the Industrial  Emissions  Directive  (IED) , replaced  the  Integrated Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  (IPPC)  Directive  and  six  sector directives, including the large combustion plants directive (2001/80/EC).\n\nThe IED strengthens a number of requirements for the prevention and reduction of pollution emitted by industrial installations into the air, water, and soil. It also establishes thresholds that are not to be exceeded.\n\n- It states that certain industrial facilities must  first obtain administrative authorization. This authorization cannot be issued by the competent administrative authority unless certain environmental  conditions  are  met  (adequate  preventive  measures against  pollution  being  undertaken  by  the  operator  and  ensuring that the facilities are not a significant source of pollution).\n\nOne  of  the  guiding  principles  of  this  directive  is  the  use  of  best available techniques (BAT) to prevent pollution of all kinds. Activities that  require  administrative  authorization  must  meet  the  BAT standard  established,  reviewed,  and  updated  by  the  European Commission,  which  publishes  the  conclusions  in  the  'BREF'  (best available techniques reference document).\n\nMost of the Group's industrial sites depend on the BREF STS (surface treatment using solvents) for automotive paint activities, which has been  revised  and  whose  new  conclusions  were  published  on December  9,  2020  in  EU  Decision  2020/2009.  The  sites  concerned therefore  have  a  year  to  submit  a  review  file  and  four  years  to comply with the new thresholds set out in the document. Moreover, the  revision  of  the  BREF  SF  concerning  foundries  also  started  in 2019.  Following  the  same  logic  as  the  BREF  STS,  this  revision  will eventually set the future emission limits for this activity.\n\nMonitoring requirements for facilities that may contaminate the soil and groundwater are provided.\n\nI\n\nThe IED also provides for the requirement to draw up a 'base report' on the condition of the site before the installation is commissioned or  before  the  first  update  of  the  authorization  issued  and  for  a redefinition of the requirement to restore the site upon cessation of activity.\n\n## Air emissions management 1.6.2.2\n\nEuropean  Directive  (EU)  2015/2193  of  November 25,  2015 regulates emissions from medium-sized combustion plants. It sets emissions thresholds for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and  dust  into  the  atmosphere  from  combustion  plants  with  a nominal thermal power greater than or equal to 1 MW and less than 50 MW,  regardless  of  the  type  of  fuel  that  they  use.  It  also establishes rules to monitor carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.\n\nOperators must implement emissions monitoring in accordance with the  requirements set out in Annex III  to  this  directive  and  periodic measurements in particular. CO measurements are required for all facilities.\n\nEuropean  regulation 517/2014  of  April 16,  2014  (F-Gas) , which repealed regulation 842/2006 on January 1, 2015, contains, prevents, and reduces emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases referred to in the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThis regulation:\n\n- discourages the use of fluorinated gases with a high impact on the P climate and encourages energy efficient and safe substitutes;\n- continues to improve the containment and end-of-life treatment P of products and equipment containing fluorinated gases;\n- promotes  consensus  on  an  international  agreement  under  the P Montreal Protocol to gradually reduce HFCs, which are the main group of fluorinated gases;\n- ensures  that  the  European  Union  takes  into  account  the  latest P scientific results obtained at the international level, as recorded in the  IPCC  fourth  Assessment  Report,  as  regards  in  particular  the substances  covered  by  the  regulation  and  their  global  warming potential (GWP).\n\nThe regulation aims to reduce fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions in  the  European  Union  by  two-thirds  compared  with  their  current level by 2030.\n\nGroupe  Renault  has  reviewed  these  obligations  and  is  taking  the necessary  measures  to  minimize  the  use  of  these  substances  and limit their discharge into the atmosphere.\n\nEuropean  Directive 2003/87/EC  establishing a scheme  for greenhouse  gas  emission  allowance  trading  systems affects  13 Group sites in France, Spain, Slovenia, and Romania. Its application for  the  current  phase (2013-2020) is mainly governed by European regulation 601/2012 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. For the fourth phase (2021-2030), this regulation is superseded by European regulation 2018/2066.",

A certain number  of  allowances  is  allocated  free  of  charge,  and  additional allowances may be purchased on the primary or secondary markets.\n\nThe allocation of free allowances is governed by strict rules, which are  specified  in  Decision  2011/278  for  the  third  phase,  and  in European regulation 2019/331 for the fourth phase.\n\nAnnual  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are  verified  by  an  independent third-party  organization  accredited  according  to  the  procedures described in European regulation 600/2012 for the third phase and in European regulation 2018/2067 for the fourth phase.\n\nChanges  to  these  regulations,  in  particular  the  loss  of  'carbon leakage' exposure status starting with the fourth phase (2021-2030) will greatly reduce the number of free allocations from sites subject to the Regulation.\n\nIn Korea, an exchange system was put in place in 2015, by a 2012 law (Act  on  Allocation  and  Trading  of  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions Allowances)  and  an  associated  decree.  The  Busan  site  (RSM)  is subject to this law.\n\n## Water management 1.6.2.3\n\nGroupe Renault is subject to the applicable European regulations on the  use  and  protection  of  water  since  it  abstracts,  uses,  and discharges water during its production processes.\n\nDirective no. 2000/60/EC of October 23, 2000, known as the Water Framework  Directive  (WFD) , establishes  a  framework  for  a community water policy.\n\nThe WFD defines a framework for the management and protection of waters by major hydrographic basin at the European level. It plays a  strategic  and  founding  role  in  water  policy,  setting  ambitious objectives  for  the  preservation  and  restoration  of  the  condition  of surface water (freshwater and coastal water) and for groundwater.\n\nThe main objectives of the directive are:\n\n- achieving,  starting  in  2015,  a  good  condition  for  all  of  these P waters, which means a good ecological and chemical condition for surface  water,  as  well  as  a  good  qualitative  and  quantitative condition for groundwater;\n- adopting a combined  approach  of  environmental quality P standards (Directive 2008/105/EC of December 16, 2008) through removal of hazardous substances and emission thresholds based on  the  best  available  techniques,  using  the  approach  that  gives the highest standards;\n- immediately  implementing  this  approach  for  priority  hazardous P substances  for  the  Community, i.e. , identifying them  and establishing emission thresholds and quality standards for them;\n\n- establishing a management plan for each hydrographic basin; P\n- taking  into  account  the  principle  of  recovering  the  costs  of P water-related  services,  integrating  the  polluter  pays  principle established  by  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European Union;\n- increasing public participation, through more  and  better P information and involving the public in decision-making.\n\nPublic  authorities  are  also  imposing  strict  regulations  on  industrial wastewater that may be discharged into collection systems and on treated  wastewater  and  sludge  from  urban  wastewater  treatment plants.\n\nThe WFD set targets for 2015, but its implementation timetable runs until 2027. Discussions are still underway on the issue of water, and on the reuse of domestic wastewater in particular. Better treatment of  this  water  could  significantly  increase  the  use  of  wastewater, especially for agricultural irrigation.\n\nFinally, the scarcity of water resources is a major challenge for the years to come, India, has accordingly already established requirements in this regard. In that country, domestic water must be treated and reused in toilets.\n\n## Waste management 1.6.2.4\n\nDirective  2008/98/EC  known  as  the  Waste  Framework  Directive (WFD) of  November 19,  2008,  defines  the  rules  applicable  to  the treatment  of  waste  within  the  European  Union.  It  applies  to  all objects  or  substances  that  the  holder  discards  or  that  he  or  she intends or is required to discard. The WFD reaffirms, in the name of the polluter pays principle, the responsibility of a waste producer to manage its waste in a way that does not endanger human health or harm the environment.\n\nThe Directive also introduces a requirement for waste producers to limit their impact on the use of resources by preventing and reducing waste with a view to transitioning to a circular economy.\n\nIt  establishes  a  hierarchy  of  waste  treatment  methods,  requiring waste producers to prioritize, in the following order:\n\n- waste prevention; P\n- preparation for reuse; P\n- recycling; P\n- other forms of recovery, in particular energy recovery; P\n- disposal. P\n\nIt also clarifies the concept of recovery, disposal, end of waste status, and  by-products  and  requires  the  establishment  of  separate collections for paper, metal, plastic, and glass, as a minimum.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT\n\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of  waste  and  its  disposal ,  which  was  adopted  on  March 22,  1989 and  entered  into  force  on  May 5,  1992,  regulates  and  limits transboundary shipments of waste.\n\nIt calls on the 187 Parties to observe fundamental principles such as proximity  to  waste  disposal,  environmentally  sound  management, prioritize  recovery,  and  prior  informed  consent  to  the  importing  of potentially hazardous substances.\n\nRegulation  (EC) 1013/2006  of  June 14,  2006 on  the  shipment  of waste transposes  the  principles  of  the  Basel  Convention  into European law.\n\nIt requires the limitation of cross-border shipment of waste through observance  of  the  principles  of  proximity  and  prioritization  of recovery.  To  determine  if  transfer  of  waste  is  possible,  and  the applicable procedure (communication or notification), the following need to be considered:\n\n- the origin of the waste (country of production); P\n- the destination and route of the waste (transfer inside or outside P the EU/EFTA/OECD);\n- the  type  of  treatment  to  be  applied  to  the  waste  (recovery  or P disposal);\n- the type of waste transferred: P\n- non-hazardous waste: green list (Annex III of the regulation), P\n- hazardous waste: orange list (Annex IV of the regulation). P\n\nUnder 'extended producer responsibility' (EPR) regimes , producers who place waste-generating products on the market must take responsibility for management of that waste financially and/or operationally.  This  responsibility  can  be  implemented  through individual, shared, or collective systems (eco-organizations).\n\nSeveral European directives have introduced this type of obligation for  certain  types  of  waste  (sectors).  In  the  course  of  its  activities, Groupe Renault is particularly concerned by regulations relating to batteries and accumulators (particularly for electric vehicle batteries) and end-of-life vehicles.\n\nDirective 2006/66/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the Council of September 6, 2006 on batteries and accumulators and battery  and  accumulator  waste  prohibits  the  marketing  of  certain batteries  and  accumulators  with  a  mercury  or  cadmium  content above a determined threshold.\n\nIn addition, it encourages a high level of collection and recycling for battery  and  accumulator  waste  as  well  as  an  improvement  in  the environmental performance of all actors in the life cycle of batteries and  accumulators,  including  during  the  recycling  and  disposal  of battery and accumulator waste.\n\nI\n\nThis  Directive  prohibits  the  landfilling  or  incineration  of  industrial and automotive battery and accumulator waste. Only their residues from both treatment and recycling may be landfilled or incinerated.\n\nThe net costs of collecting, processing, and recycling industrial and automotive  batteries  and  accumulators  must  be  paid  by  the producers.\n\nDirective 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000 on end-of-life vehicles  (ELVs) defines  the  measures  to  be  taken  to  prevent  and limit  waste from end-of-life vehicles and their components, and to ensure that they are reused, recycled, or recovered.\n\nVehicle  and  equipment  manufacturers  must  take  into  account  the dismantling,  reuse,  and  recovery  of  vehicles  in  the  design  and production of their products, limit the use of hazardous substances, and integrate an increasing share of recycled materials into vehicles.\n\nThe  reuse  and  recycling  rate  for  end-of-life  vehicles  must  reach  a minimum  of  85%  by  weight  per  vehicle  per  year  on  average.  The reuse  and  recovery  rate  must  reach  a  minimum  of  95%  by  weight per vehicle per year on average.\n\nProducers (manufacturers or importers) must set up ELV collection systems,  and  owners  may  drop  off  their  ELVs  at  authorized treatment  facilities  only,  at  no  cost  to  them  (unless  the  vehicle  is incomplete).\n\nThere  is  currently  no  need  for  producers  to  contribute  to  the economic balance of the sector, as the costs of processing ELVs is offset  by  the  sale  of  stripped  vehicles  to  approved  shredders  and parts  and  materials  on  the  used  vehicle,  renovation  and  recycling market.\n\nIn conclusion, European and global environmental regulations have changed  significantly  over  the  past  20 years,  Groupe  Renault  is ensuring that the regulations that apply to it are identified as soon as  possible  and  taken  into  account  in  its  production  system.  The European  Union's  Green  Deal  is  a  new  European  roadmap  for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The policy is aimed notably at the  circular  economy  and  the  preservation  of  resources  and biodiversity,  which  are  also  central  to  Groupe  Renault's  concerns. Groupe Renault is therefore preparing to meet the new challenges by showing vigilance and continuing to pursue an approach designed to continuously reduce its impact on the environment.\n\nEven  though  the  European  Union  is  still  the  leader  in  this  area, countries like Korea, China, and India, which are strongly impacted by  the  scarcity  of  resources  (water  in  particular)  and  increasing pollution (air and waste) are beginning to introduce more stringent regulations.",

By way of exception, agreements limiting competition (in particular through  selection  of  resellers  or  provision  for  exclusive  terms  for them)  are  authorized  when  they  may  contribute  to  improving  the production and distribution  of  products  or  to  promote  technical  or economic progress.\n\nThe  purpose  of the  European  Commission's  block  exemption regulations  no.  330/2010  of  April 20,  2010  and  no. 461/2010  of May 27,  2010 , which  are  applicable  to  the  distribution  of  new vehicles and the supply of spare automotive parts and to repair and maintenance services  for  motor  vehicles  respectively,  is  to  exempt from  the  prohibition  of  cartels,  agreements  presumed  to  improve distribution without eliminating competition.\n\nThe  criteria  for  this  automatic  exemption  depend  on  the  market shares of the parties to an agreement (maximum threshold of 30%) and  the  absence  of  any  marked  restrictions  on  competition.  As applied  to  the  automotive  sector,  this  exemption  is  in  principle applicable  to  the  selection  by  manufacturers  of  their  network  of authorized distributors and repairers. However, the presence of one of the following restrictions may prohibit the exemption from being applied:\n\n- setting  the  price  (fixed  or  minimum)  at  which  distributors  can P resell vehicles  or  spare  parts  (prohibition  of  resale  price maintenance);\n- the  distribution  of  geographic  markets  or  customers  between P distributors (market distribution);\n- the  ban  on  sourcing  by  authorized  distributors  from  other P authorized distributors (restriction of cross-deliveries);\n- the ban on the resale by authorized distributors of spare parts to P independent repairers for use in repair or maintenance services; and\n- the  ban  on  the  use  by  authorized  repairers  of  spare  parts  of  a P quality  equivalent  to  original  parts  for  repair  or  maintenance services.\n\nSimilarly,  under regulation no. 461/2010, any restriction concerning access  by  independent  repairers  to  the  technical  information necessary for the repair and maintenance of vehicles is presumed to exclude the benefit of exemption from the selection by Renault of its network of authorized repairers.\n\nRegulation  no. 330/2010  expires  on  May 31,  2022.  Its  effectiveness has  been  under  evaluation  by  the  European  Commission  since October 2018, and it will decide no sooner than the second quarter of 2020 whether to let the regulation lapse or to extend or revise it.\n\nRegulation  no. 461/2010  expires  on  May 31,  2023.  Its  effectiveness has been under evaluation by the European Commission, and it will decide no sooner than the second quarter of 2021 whether to let the regulation lapse or to extend or revise it.\n\n## Community design regulations 1.6.4\n\nCouncil  regulation  (EC)  no. 6/2002  of  December 12,  2001  on community designs provides  for  the  principle  of  the  repair  clause, which excludes the protection of visible spare parts of a vehicle via designs and models (repair clause principle) in order to promote free market  competition  by  allowing  any  company  to  manufacture  and sell spare parts on the after-sales market.\n\nAt the national level, European states remain divided over the repair clause. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Spain, and, since January 1, 2020, Germany, have adopted the repair clause as  national  law.  However,  other  countries  such  as  France,  Slovakia and Croatia refuse this deregulation and therefore do not apply the repair clause principle.\n\nThe  repair  clause  could  become  applicable  to  all  European  Union countries. In late 2018, the European Commission launched a public consultation  on  the  overall  assessment  of  the  design  and  model system  with  questions  relating  to  the  repair  clause.  In  addition, France has already submitted a bill on this subject, in which adoption of the repair clause is being considered.\n\nThe extension of the repair  clause to all European Union countries, it would have a significant economic impact on the Groupe Renault's after-sales market share.\n\nI",

These texts have redefined the rules governing  the  approval  conditions  for  credit  institutions,  the governance  of  credit  institutions,  internal  control  and  senior executive compensation, with the aim of harmonizing the regulations  applicable  to  credit  institutions  in  these  areas  at European  level.  They  are  therefore  an  essential  step  towards  the achievement of the internal market in the banking sector. Directive 2019/878 amended Directive 2013/36 as regards exempted entities, financial  holding  companies,  mixed  financial  holding  companies, compensation,  supervisory  measures  and  powers,  and  capital conservation  measures.  This  directive  was  transposed  into  French law  by  Order  no.  2020-1635  of  December  21,  2020  bringing  in  a number of provisions adapting the legislation to European Union law on financial matters.\n\nEuropean  Regulation 575/2013  of  June  26,2013  on  prudential requirements  for  credit  institutions  and  investment  companies , known as the \"CRD IV Directive\", introduced new requirements for capital,  liquidity,  and  leverage  ratios.  This  regulation  aims  to strengthen  the  solidity  of  European  banking  institutions  by improving  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  aspects  of  capital.  This text was amended by regulation 2019/630 as regards the minimum coverage  of  losses  on  non-performing  exposures.  This  new regulation also supplements the existing prudential rules as regards capital with provisions for a deduction from capital if non-performing  exposures are not sufficiently covered by provisions or other adjustments.\n\nDirective 2014/59  of  May 15,  2014  establishing  a  framework  for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment companies , known as the \"BRRD Directive\" set out a framework for the recovery and resolution of  credit institutions. This text aims to ensure that bankruptcies of European banks are managed in such a way  as  to  preserve  financial  stability  and  minimize  costs  for taxpayers. It gives the competent authorities the means to intervene before  difficulties  arise  and,  where  necessary,  at  the  start  of  the resolution  process.  The  directive  entered  into  force  on  January 1, 2015.  These  measures  were  supplemented  by  regulation 806/2014 of  July 15,  2014,  which  established  a  single  resolution  mechanism\n\nI\n\n(SRM) and a single resolution fund (SRF). Finally, this directive was amended  by  Directive 2019/879  of  May 20,  2019  as  regards  the capacity  to  absorb  losses  and  recapitalize  credit  institutions.  This directive clarifies the fixing of the MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities specific to each establishment).\n\nDirective 2008/48  of  April  23,  2018  on  credit  agreements  for consumers was  transposed  in  France  by  Law 2010-737  of  July 1, 2010  on  consumer  credit  reform.  The  purpose  of  these  texts  is  to provide better consumer protection and to harmonize national credit distribution rules. These  texts  require  credit  institutions to strengthen  consumer  information  by  providing  them  with  a standardized European pre-contractual information sheet.\n\nDirective  2018/843  of  May 30,  2018 amended Directive 2015/849 on  the  prevention  of  the  use  of  the  financial  system  for  the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing . This text was transposed in France by Government Order 2020-115 of February 12, 2021. This system:\n\n- strengthens the transparency of complex legal entities and legal P structures by broadening access to registers of beneficial owners;\n- sets out the enhanced due diligence measures to be implemented P with  respect  to  business  relationships  or  transactions  involving high-risk third countries;\n- sets out the guarantees to be put in place to mitigate high money P laundering risks associated with entering into a remote business relationship; and\n- establishes the principle of consolidated supervision of AML-CFT P procedures by banking and insurance groups.\n\n## Directive 2016/97  of  January 20,  2016  on  insurance  distribution ,\n\ntransposed in France by Decree 2018-361 of May 16, 2018, aims to ensure better consumer protection and harmonize national rules for the  distribution  of  insurance  products.  This  text  requires  the establishment  of  governance  procedures  for  the  design  and distribution  of  insurance  products  and  the  delivery  of  a  new standardized information document (IPID) to customers.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the European Banking Authority published Outsourcing  Guidelines (EBA/GL/2019/02).  These  guidelines  set forth a governance framework for outsourcing operations. Accordingly,  they  require  an  evaluation  of  each  subcontractor,  the keeping  of  a  register  of  services  outsourced,  and  the  inclusion  in contracts  with  subcontractors  of  a  certain  number  of  clauses  to ensure good control of the risks associated with the outsourcing.",

The  purpose  of  this  text  is  to  harmonize  the definition  of  default  by  providing  a  detailed  clarification  of  the various  reasons  for  default  (including  the  counting  of  days  in arrears),  the  conditions  for  a  return  to  non-default  and  the associated processes. The text will be applicable starting January 1, 2021.\n\nIn addition, on September 28, 2016, the European Banking Authority published a text entitled 'Final report DRTS on materiality threshold for credit obligation past due' (RTS/2016/06). This text introduces a single methodology for the counting of days in arrears (Day past due counting)  based  on  the  application  of  absolute  and  relative materiality thresholds.\n\nPOST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\n\nIn  its  regulation 2018/1845  of  November 21,  2018,  the  absolute threshold  was  set  at  \u20ac100  for  exposures  to  retail  customers  and \u20ac500  for  other  exposures.  These  rules  must  be  obeyed  starting December 31, 2020.\n\nFinally,  the  European  Banking  Authority  also  published  guidelines for  estimates  of  probability  of  default  and  estimates  of  loss  given default (EBA-GL-2017-16).\n\nThese guidelines are part of the wider work of the European Banking Authority  to  reduce  unjustified  variability  in  the  results  of  internal models while preserving the risk sensitivity of capital requirements.\n\n## POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS 1.7\n\n- On January 14, 2021, following the approval of the Board of Directors, Luca de Meo, CEO of Groupe Renault, presented Renaulution, a new P strategic plan that aims to reorient Groupe Renault's strategy from the quest for volumes to value creation (for more details on Renaulution, see chapter 1.1.3 \"Strategy\").\n- On March 12, 2021, Renault S.A. announced the successful sale of its entire stake in Daimler AG (i.e. 16,448,378 shares representing 1.54% of P the share capital of Daimler) at a price of 69.50 euros per share (i.e., a total amount of c. 1.143 billion euros), through a placement to qualified investors, as defined in Article 2 point (e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended, by way of an accelerated book building process.\n\nThe  proceeds  of  this  sale  will  allow  the  Renault  Group  to  accelerate  the  financial  deleveraging  of  its  Automotive  activity.  The  industrial partnership between the Renault Group and Daimler remains unchanged and is not impacted by this financial transaction (1) . Settlement of the offering should take place on March 16, 2021 at the latest.\n\n- Except for the waiver (to ensure reciprocity among the two companies) of the obligation for Daimler to propose first to Renault to acquire its (1) shares in case of a sale through a capital markets transaction.\n\n01",

A study on the company's culture was also carried out at this time.  The  members of the Ethics & CSR Committee were regularly informed of the progress of the work.\n\nAs  a  follow-up  to  this  announcement, the  Group's  new  CSR ambitions,  which  will  focus  on  three  areas  -  the  environment, inclusion  and  safety  will  also  be  disclosed  during  the  Annual General Meeting.",

Each year, members must attest to the effective implementation of these principles in a 'progress  communication'  report,  which  is  posted  on  the  Global Compact's website.\n\nTwenty years later, the United Nations Global Compact is the world's largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative, bringing together more than 13,000 participants in 170 countries. Nearly 70 local  networks  around  the  world  ensure  a  close  relationship  with members and national mobilization.\n\nThe Global  Compact is  also  the  starting  point  for  any  organization seeking  to  support  the  17  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs), adopted  in  September  2015  by  the  UN.  These  goals  provide  a universal  agenda  to  be  achieved  by  the  year  2030  for  a  more sustainable and inclusive world.\n\nThese 10 principles are inspired by:\n\n- the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; P\n- the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; P\n- International Labor Organization; P\n- the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development; P\n- the United Nations Convention against Corruption. P\n\n## Our contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015 by the Member States of the United Nations, is an action plan designed to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all human beings live in peace and prosperity. It is structured around 17 Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  169  targets  that  take  into  account  the  three  aspects  of  sustainable  development:  the  economy,  social aspects and the environment. The latter are aimed at all stakeholders: States, local authorities, civil society, and economic and financial actors.\n\nThrough its geographical footprint, the diversity of its businesses and its commitment to CSR, Groupe Renault contributes - to a greater or lesser extent - to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals identified by the United Nations. Its contribution is highlighted in the table below, which lists the targets to which Groupe Renault is committed together with examples of initiatives, and highlights the SDGs to which the Group contributes directly: SDGs 3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 16.\n\nI\n\n02",

Spearheaded  by  the  CSR department,  a  cross-functional  steering  committee  supervised  the methodological  approach  and  the  key  stages  of  the  project.  This matrix  was  validated  in  January  2020  by  the  Group  Executive Committee and by Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Methodological approach\n\nThe materiality matrix was defined by management representatives from the Company's main departments/functions, based on internal and external data.\n\nThe first stage of the process was to define the comprehensive list of ESG  issues  to  which  Groupe  Renault  is  faced  as  a  carmaker  and supplier  of  mobility  services.  Numerous  sources  were  consulted  to prepare  this  list,  particularly  the  ESG  rating  criteria,  competitors' materiality matrices, press articles and interviews with experts.\n\nAll of the  issues  collected  were  grouped  into  14  coherent macro-issues. The importance of each issue along each axis of the matrix was then assessed.\n\nThe  y-axis  represents  the  influence  on  stakeholders'  opinions  or behavior and classifies the issues according to the CSR expectations of  Groupe  Renault's  stakeholders.  The  importance  of  issues  along this axis was  determined  from  interviews  with  stakeholder representatives (employees,  NGOs,  suppliers,  car  dealerships, start-ups, researchers, public sector, investors) as well as a survey of 3,500 customers in seven countries in the five Regions where Groupe Renault operates.\n\nThe  x-axis  illustrates  the  impact  on  the  Company's  sustainable performance  and  represents  the  contribution  of  each  theme  to long-term  value  creation.  To  assess  the  importance  of  each  issue\n\nI\n\nalong  this  axis,  internal  interviews  took  place  with  the  Group's General  Management,  employees  in  the  main  departments/ functions and an internal survey with 200 of Groupe Renault's top managers.\n\nThe issues were then refined and placed on the materiality matrix during a collaborative workshop bringing together the representatives of Groupe Renault's main departments/functions.\n\nAs  in  2015, Reducing  the  total  carbon  footprint  and  Reducing  the impact  of  the  use  of  vehicles  on  air  quality are  Groupe  Renault's priorities. Internal and external stakeholders expect Groupe Renault to  continue  its  efforts  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  air pollution  due  to  road  transport.  They  also  assessed  the  impact  of these two issues on Groupe Renault's long-term sales performance as critical, notably due to tightened regulations and the decrease in the societal acceptability of vehicle emissions.\n\nSimilarly, Improving  passenger  and  road  user  safety  and  Limiting the  impact  on  resources  particularly  through  the  circular  economy remain  two  major  stakeholder  expectations,  as  well  as  being important issues to guarantee the Company's performance.\n\nSome issues increased in importance in the 2020 materiality matrix. One  of  the  main  changes  compared  to  2015  concerns  stakeholder expectations  (particularly  for  investors  and  the  public  sector)  on corporate governance. Guaranteeing robust governance was considered  to  be  an  essential  prerequisite  when  undertaking  any transformation  of  Groupe  Renault  and  was,  therefore,  prioritized both in terms of stakeholder expectations and impact on Company performance.\n\nIn a context of changes in skill requirements (related to the electric vehicle, connected and autonomous technologies, etc .) and growing employee  expectations  in  terms  of  the  environment  and  working methods, Ensuring employee well-being and development is  also  a growing issue for Groupe Renault.\n\nIn response to the on-going transformation of the mobility industry and the growing search for optimization of urban areas, the internal stakeholders  expect  the Contribution  of  Groupe  Renault  to  the transformation of urban mobility to have a more significant impact on the Company's performance than in 2015.\n\nStakeholder  expectations  concerning  Groupe  Renault's  actions  on Ensuring respect for human rights and work throughout the supply chain were also reinforced compared to 2015.",

The Global Framework Agreement is in line with Groupe Renault's Declaration of Employees' Fundamental Rights  dated  October 12,  2004,  which  it  extends.  Without  being exclusive,  it  accordingly  constitutes  one  of  the  frames  of  reference for  the  implementation  and  monitoring  of  reasonable  vigilance measures pursuant to the law dated March 27, 2017.\n\nThe progress of the work is periodically presented at the Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\n## Mapping of risks identified for the 'duty of vigilance' law /uni00A0DV1a/uni00A0\n\nGroupe Renault has chosen to distinguish the risks resulting from its activities from the risks resulting from the activities of its suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nWithin the three major categories of risks laid down by the law, the Group  has  identified  several  macro-risks  concerning  the  activities that are specific to it:\n\n- human rights and fundamental freedoms (see 2.4.1.4.A): P\n- discrimination in employment and occupation, P\n- infringements of freedom of association and non-recognition of P the right to collective bargaining;\n\nI\n\n- health and safety of people (see 2.4.2.4): P\n- workplace accidents (frequency and gravity), P\n- occupational illnesses; P\n- environment (see 2.2.2.E): P\n- the use of water resources, P\n- pollutant discharges to water and the natural environment, P\n- the  production  of  waste  and  its  management  in  ad  hoc P infrastructure, particularly hazardous waste,\n- the pollution of soil and groundwater, P\n- air pollution related to the use of chemical products or processes P generating atmospheric pollutants,\n- climate change. P\n\n## /uni00A0DV1b/uni00A0\n\nConcerning risks relating to suppliers and subcontractors, the Group has  distinguished  two  macro  risks:  those  related  to  families  of purchases (of parts and services) and those related to countries (see 2.5.2.34).",

        "page_content": "## Professional whistle-blowing /uni00A0DV4/uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe vigilance plan includes setting up a whistle-blowing mechanism and collecting alerts relating to the existence or realization of risks, established  in  consultation  with  the  representative  unions  of  the company.\n\nIn this context, the Group has introduced a professional whistle-blowing  system  open  to  employees.  The  Group  has  also chosen  to open  the  whistle-blowing  system  to  external  and occasional  employees,  as  well  as  to  suppliers  and  subcontractors with  which  an  established  commercial  relationship  exists,  when these activities are related to this relationship.\n\nThe global whistle-blowing system rolled out in 2018 is available in 14  languages  and  is  operational  in  almost  all  countries.  It  is managed by an external service provider and can be accessed at any time, any day of the week, on a professional or personal computer, tablet  or  smartphone,  via  the  internet  at  the  following  address: https://renault.whistleb.com. For certain countries, a telephone line managed  by  the  service  provider  is  also  available.  It  guarantees confidentiality of communication and enables the whistle-blower to remain  anonymous  subject  to  local  law.  During  2020,  new awareness-raising  initiatives  were  carried  out,  notably  on  the Group's intranet, to remind people how the system works.\n\nCREATING SHARED VALUES THAT RESPECT SOCIETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe system enables suppliers and subcontractors to raise an alert in the event of risks concerning serious infringements to human rights, fundamental  freedoms,  health  and  safety  of  persons  or  the environment, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force.\n\nThey were informed of this possibility by mail in 2018; a reminder is planned for 2021.\n\nEach alert is studied, depending on the case or the country, by the Deputy  Director  for  Professional  Alerts  or  by  the  local  ethics  and compliance correspondent or the local whistle-blowing officer.\n\nThe Alert Processing Committee, composed of seven members and three experts, collectively handles professional alerts received by the Deputy Director for Professional Alerts for France.\n\nThe  Country  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee,  chaired  by  the country director and steered by the country ethics and compliance officer,  handles  professional  alerts  received  by  the  local  ethics  and compliance or alert officer.\n\nEvery year,  the  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  department  presents the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee (CECG) and the Audit, Risks  and  Compliance  Committee  (CARC)  with  a  detailed  report containing statistics relative to professional whistle-blowing worldwide.\n\n## Extra-Financial Performance Declaration 2.1.6\n\nGroupe Renault prepares a detailed analysis of the risks to which the Group may be exposed, including the extra-financial risks that may call into question the Company's ability to maintain its overall performance. The complete approach and comprehensive information on risks in general is presented in section 1.6 this Universal registration document.\n\n## Methodology for reporting 2.1.6.1 extra-financial performance\n\n## Regulatory context\n\nIn accordance with the order no. 2017-1180 dated July 19, 2017, and Decree  no. 2017-1265  dated  August 9,  2017,  Groupe  Renault  has established the Extra-Financial Performance Declaration (EFPD).\n\nIdentification of the main social, societal and environmental risks of Groupe  Renault  is  based  on  international  standards  and  norms - such as INERIS and the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) - as well as internal mapping (Group major risks, corruption risks, pursuant to the provisions of the Sapin II law, risks relating to the vigilance plan, as well as issues identified in the  materiality matrix (see 2.1.4)).\n\n## Process of identification of the main extra-financial risks\n\nIdentification and summary of the principal risks with regard to the expectations of the Extra-financial Performance Declaration (EFPD) was  undertaken  collaboratively,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Risk Management  and  CSR  departments,  with  representatives  of  the various  departments  and  managers  in  charge  of  subjects  coming within  the  scope  of  the  declaration  of  extra-financial  performance, and notably:\n\n- the environment; P\n- Human Resources; P\n- international social relations; P\n- purchasing and relationships with suppliers and subcontractors; P\n- health, safety, ergonomics and the environment (HSEE); P\n- IS/IT; P\n- road safety; P\n- the development of new products and services; P\n- tax; P\n- legal affairs; P\n- ethics and compliance. P\n\nGroupe  Renault  also  takes  into  account  the  United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals and market practices identified in its sector.\n\nThe  Company  has  also  taken  into  consideration  the  information listed  in  item III  of  Article L. 225-102-1  of  the  French  Commercial Code. Certain topics have not been identified as pertinent principal risks  in  respect  of  the  Group's  activities  and  shareholders'  known expectations,  notably  those  relating  to  food  (food  waste,  fighting food insecurity, respect for animal welfare and responsible, fair and sustainable food).\n\nI\n\n02",

P\n\nPolicies,  procedures  and  the  results  of  these  procedures,  including performance  indicators,  have  been  established  for  each  of  these risks.\n\nThe  31  principal  risks  were  categorized  as  E  for  the  main Environmental risks, S for Social and Societal and G for Governance and  related  to  the  issues  in  the  materiality  matrix  (see  table  in 2.1.6.2 below).\n\n## Data collection process\n\nEach  indicator  is  associated  with  a  coordinator,  generally  a business-line  expert,  who  has  collected,  checked  and  consolidated the data within his/her reporting scope.\n\nThe  indicators  are  then  initially  validated  by  the  manager responsible for producing the indicator within his/her activity, then validated again by the manager of the entity concerned.\n\nAll of the data is consolidated by the CSR department.\n\nI\n\n## Reporting scope\n\nThe  EFPD  target  scope  is  identical  to  that  of  Groupe  Renault's consolidated  financial  reporting  (see  section 4.2.6,  note 31  to  the consolidated financial statements), namely Renault SA, its subsidiaries and  controlled  entities (within the meaning  of Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code). When an indicator does not cover the entire scope, clarifications are provided with the indicator.\n\nData on AVTOVAZ is gradually being included in the CSR reporting scope. Details on the indicators that are included and excluded from the reporting scope can be found in section 2.4 and 2.6.1.2.\n\n## True and fair and verifiable data\n\nGroupe Renault has voluntarily asked one of its statutory auditors to certify  a  selection  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  its  main industrial,  office  and  logistics  sites  since  1999.  This  verification  is carried  out  with  an  equivalent  level  of  assurance  to  the  financial data  (reasonable  assurance  within  the  meaning  of  the  IFAC's  ISAE 3000 for extra-financial verification). The indicators covered by the reasonable assurance report are listed in note 2.6.6.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Order  no. 2017-1180  of  July 19,  2017,  on  the publication of extra-financial information by certain large companies and groups of companies, amended successively by Act no. 2018-771 of September 5, 2018, Act no. 2018-898 of October 23, 2018, and Act no. 2018-938 of October 30, 2018, Decree no. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017,  to  implement  Order  no. 2017-1180  of  July 19,  2017,  and  the decision  of  September 14,  2018,  amending  the  decision  of  May 13, 2013, the Group appointed an independent third party to verify the compliance  of  the  EFPD  (Extra-Financial  Performance  Declaration) and  the  accuracy  of  the  information  contained  therein.

For  tertiary  functions,  telework  was  generalized  and widely developed during this unprecedented period.\n\nIn  the  sales  network,  employees  -  strictly  applying  the  protocol  of the reinforced measures set up by the Group - mobilized to provide service and after-sales activities to fix, maintain and repair medical, firefighting and police vehicles, as well as those needed to maintain the continuity of public services.\n\nSignificant  internal  communication  dedicated  to  the  unfolding health situation has been provided on a permanent basis since the beginning of the crisis,  notably  via  the  Group's  intranet  portal,  but also  by  e-mail,  managerial  information  kits,  notifications  on  the \"Inside  R\"  smartphone  app,  and  posters.  Information  on  COVID-19 safety precautions was  widely  communicated  to  employees throughout the Group.\n\nIn  France,  all  sites  have  been  structured  locally  since  March  to manage the health plan, and health committees bringing together all the players (HR, general services, safety, medical, communication, etc .) have been set up on each one.\n\nAt the beginning of April, after a presentation to the Group Works Council,  the  Company  implemented  a global  health  reference framework drawn  up  by  the  occupational  physicians  and  health services, and the HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) department. It  lays  down  11  conditions  for  the  gradual  return  of  employees  to their site and four prerequisites before any employee can return to the workplace. The reference framework has been applied nationally and adapted in line with local conditions. Health measures include the provision of masks for work and for commutes, the provision of hand sanitizer and the redesign of certain work areas.\n\nIn addition, the Group has set up a mask production line, certified to current standards, to meet its needs and guarantee the health and safety of its employees at all sites and throughout the sales network  in  Europe (industrial  and  tertiary  sites,  the  Renault dealership network and the private network). This production unit, located  at  the  Renault  plant  in  Flins  (France)  since  May,  launched production  in  July. It  enables  the  production  of  up  to  1.5  million surgical  masks  per  week in  compliance  with  the  Group's  safety standards.\n\nI\n\n## Gradual and secure resumption 2.1.7.2 of/uni00A0activity in April\n\nFrom  mid-April,  production  and  commercial  activities  gradually resumed,  with  the  systematic  implementation  of  health  measures adapted  to  the  development  of  the  epidemic  and  local  laws,  and priority going to employee health and safety.\n\nThe  upturn  in  activity  initially  took  place  with  a  very  limited workforce and a very gradual increase in production rates in plants. In the network, digital showrooms have been developed (with a live chat between customers and salespeople in the United Kingdom and Italy, for example).\n\nThis  gradual  and  adapted  recovery  has  made  it  possible  to  train employees in the new health measures put in place and to give them time  to  understand  their  new  work  environment  so  that  they  can resume work with confidence.\n\nIn France, the \"Solidarity and Future Contract\" agreement signed on April 2, 2020 has enabled the Group to adapt its operations to the economic  situation  through  quality  social  dialogue,  in  a  spirit  of solidarity, and again with the aim of protecting the Company and its employees.  In  particular,  it  provides  for  a  guarantee  of  100%  of employees' net pay in the event of recourse to furlough schemes, in return  for  the  deduction  of  two  days'  leave  to  be  paid  into the solidarity  fund and  one  day's  leave  for  each  week  off  work.  The central  solidarity  fund  was  created  under  a  former  company agreement to provide a permanent, centralized reserve of days from which  sites  using  the  furlough  scheme,  for  whatever  reason,  can draw to top up the wages of the employees concerned.\n\nDuring the second phase of lockdown , industrial activity continued, in accordance with the government recommendation that economic activity should  be  maintained  as  much  as  possible.  In  the \u00cele-de-France region, full telework was re-introduced for all eligible workers and continued into early 2021.\n\n## Groupe Renault employees united and 2.1.7.3 committed in the face of the crisis\n\nIn  the  face  of  the  COVID-19  crisis,  a  vast  outpouring  of  solidarity quickly  took  shape  within  Groupe  Renault.  Throughout  the  world, the  men  and  women  of  the  Company  mobilized  to  meet  the exceptional needs generated by the health crisis, particularly those of healthcare personnel and hospitals.\n\nFrom Spain to Morocco and Romania to France ,  the company as a whole has taken action in the form of practical initiatives involving donations  or  loans  of  vehicles,  but  also  through  the  launch  of projects  for  the  manufacture  of  essential  equipment  to  slow  the spread of the virus or help the sick.",

        "page_content": "## Initiatives for caregivers\n\nNumerous loans  of  vehicles were  arranged  to  make  it  as  easy  as possible  for  front-line  health  workers  to  fight  the  epidemic.  In France ,  Groupe  Renault  made  nearly 1,300  vehicles available  to such  employees  at  the  end  of  March,  including  300  Renault  ZOE vehicles from the ZITY car-sharing service in Paris.\n\n- In Switzerland ,  the  dealer  network  made  around 100 Renault ZOE vehicles  available  to  several  emergency  organizations  (Red  Cross, Spitex and Pro-Senectute).\n- In Romania , around 100 Dacia or Renault vehicles were entrusted to the Ministry of Health for hospital staff.\n- In Morocco , 50 LODGY, TRAFIC and MASTER vehicles were specially converted  into  ambulances  to  transport  patients.  In  addition,  the Renault Morocco Foundation donated 100 laptops to the Melloussa for Local Development association to support the schooling of young people in disadvantaged areas.\n\nRenault Alg\u00e9rie also lent vehicles to hospitals in Oran and Boufarik and to the health departments in Algiers and Bilda, while the Oran plant manufactured respirator valves and oxygen fittings for the city hospital.\n\nIn Mexico ,  a  joint initiative between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi involved  the  loan  of  25  vehicles  to  international  NGO  Doctors Without Borders.\n\n- In Colombia , Groupe Renault joined forces with local associations to transport food products using the KANGOO Z.E. to underprivileged families and health workers.\n\nIn  other countries, the Group's partner car-sharing services offered their fleets to the medical profession: this was the case in Denmark, with  the  loan  of  400  electric  vehicles  from  the  Green  Mobility service.\n\nIn  March,  several  industrial  sites  in  France,  but  also  in  Spain, Portugal and Slovenia, donated around 120,000 masks (from plant stocks  originally  intended  for  maintenance  operations)  to health workers .\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, AVTOVAZ donated 6,800 protective suits to hospitals in Togliatti. And in France, the Flins site offered 300 suits usually  used  for  painting  to  the  teams  at  the  Mignot  Hospital  in Versailles, the main intensive care facility in western Paris.\n\n## Remarkable solidarity initiatives launched, notably/uni00A0in engineering\n\nIn Spain ,  120  Groupe  Renault  employees  created  the Renault  al Rescate (Renault to the rescue) movement, which formed a genuine chain  of  solidarity  that  began  making  masks  using  3D  printers.  In just four days, more than 4,000 of them were distributed to hospitals and retirement homes in Valladolid, Palencia, Malaga and Jerez.\n\nA similar initiative was also launched by Renault teams in Brazil.\n\nCREATING SHARED VALUES THAT RESPECT SOCIETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn Turkey, Oyak Renault produced protective equipment for health workers at the Bursa plant in collaboration with the provincial health department,  including  intubation  equipment,  fever  measurement units  and  mobile  sampling  and  testing  booths.  A  large  number  of individual  employees  undertook  to  make  items  including  visors, masks, hand sanitizer dispensers, overshirts and door pullers, or to staff telephone hotlines or provide other services.\n\n- In France , many centers and plants (Douai, Sovab, CRP, Cl\u00e9on, Flins, Le Mans, Villeurbanne, Dieppe, MCA) decided to manufacture visors from  injection  molds  developed  at  the  Technocentre,  producing several  thousand  units per  week.  This  experience  was  shared through dedicated task forces with Renault teams in Romania, Brazil and the Africa - Middle-East - India region so that such initiatives could be swiftly replicated locally. Thanks to its employees, Groupe Renault manufactured 30,000 visors in the first week .\n\nIn  France,  Groupe  Renault  joined  forces  with  other  companies  in \"Makers for Life\", an initiative led by the CEA and supported by the French  Government  Defense  procurement  and  technology  agency and the Ministry of Defense's Defense Innovation Agency, to design a low-cost, emergency respirator for series production.\n\nIn  this  context, a  team  of  Renault  and  Renault  Sport  Racing engineers designed  several  parts  specifically  for  the  project,  in particular  the blower , an  engine  component  that  supplies  the respirator  with  compressed  air.  These  engineers  also  developed  a virtual  digital  lung  model  that  allows  the  physical  and  software design  of  the  ventilator  to  evolve  rapidly  by  simulating  a  range  of clinical  cases.  The  Group's  exceptional  network  of  many  skills  notably mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering, product-process  design,  manufacturing  and  logistics,  Renault medical  experts,  quality, purchasing,  industrial property  and management control - was a determining factor in optimizing the design  of  the  ventilator  and  making  it  compatible  with  large-scale production. Some  15  artificial respirator prototypes were manufactured  at  the  Prototype  production  center  at  the Technocentre in Guyancourt.\n\nThe  developments  of  the  MAKAIR  RE20  ventilator  specific  to Renault  (including  the  11  patents  filed)  were  made  available under  a  free  open-source  license , via  the  Github  open-source platform,  to  enable  players  in  crisis  situations  to  manufacture  this model of artificial respirator cheaply. Similar projects also emerged in Spain and Romania. Most often collective, they demonstrate the importance  of  complementary  know-how  and  the  value  of open-source data sharing.\n\nThe health crisis has also led to a shortage of syringe pumps that can  continuously  administer  an  average  of  four  medications  per patient.  To  help  fill  the  gap  in  intensive  care  units,  a  team  hailing mainly from the engineering and design departments and working at  the  Guyancourt,  Aubevoye  and  Nice  sites  worked  with  the hospitals  of  Bichat-Claude  Bernard,  La  Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re  and  the Paris public hospital system (AP-HP) to produce a prototype electric syringe  pump and studies for the series production, validation and approval  of  the  product  by  the  medical  authorities.  It  was  a  feat achieved in record time and hailed by the AP-HP's General agency for health equipment and products (AGEPS). Here too, all plans and software  were  made  available  free  of  charge  to  the  scientific community via the Github open-source platform.\n\nI\n\n02",

        "page_content": "## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT 2.2\n\n## The ecological challenges 2.2.1\n\nThere  is  now  a  consensus  on  the  magnitude  of  environmental challenges  and  the  urgency  of  finding  solutions.  These  challenges profoundly  affect  all  economic  activities  and  notably  mobility. Beyond the expectations of the stakeholders regarding the transport sector, the ability of Groupe Renault to propose innovative solutions also provides new economic opportunities and boosts competitiveness.\n\nThe  automotive  industry  needs  to  address  major  environmental issues:\n\n- climate change related to greenhouse gas emissions, for which the P Paris COP 21 agreement has plotted an ambitious reduction path;\n- resources,  the  limited  availability  of  which  implies  changing P modes of production and use;\n- health,  a  major  concern  (particularly  in  cities),  which  requires P reduction of pollutant emissions.\n\nTo respond to these challenges, the Group's environmental strategy is  based on three levers for transforming individual mobility, which are real drivers of competitiveness:\n\n- the  electric  vehicle  and  services  provided  by  batteries  to  the P energy  sector,  notably  through  their  second  life  use  and  smart recharging  systems  which  can  accelerate  the  transition  to renewable energies;\n- the circular economy, for which the Group can rely on a complete P industrial ecosystem for recycling and remanufacturing and which constitutes,  for  the  most  strategic  or  critical  materials,  both  a response to the environmental challenge and an economic asset;\n- new electric and shared mobility services, which are designed to P be  integrated  into  urban  travel  plans,  providing  benefits  by reducing congestion, improving air quality and the efficient use of resources.\n\nThese  areas  are  fully  in  line  with  the  new  Renault  strategic  plan presented in January 2021, which provides for the launch of 10 new electric  vehicles  by  2025,  and  the  transformation  of  the  Flins  site into  a  Re-factory,  the  first  European  circular  economy  plant dedicated to mobility, and the creation of the Mobilize business unit, which aims to develop mobility and energy services.\n\nGroupe  Renault  has  undertaken  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  in Europe  by  2050,  and  has  therefore  integrated  into  its  strategic approach the ambitions for 2030-2040-2050 presented in the Green Deal for Europe, published in November 2019, which aims to make Europe  the  first  area  to  commit  key  sectors  of  activity  (including mobility) to a path compatible with the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The scenarios for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 for the mobility sector that underpin this ambition have been set  out  for  the  Group  in  terms  of  the  vehicle  offer  and  powertrain mix,  in  terms  of  the  outlook  for  battery  development  (chemistry, production  conditions  and  associated  services),  in  terms  of material/materials issues and the circular economy, and in terms of operations in plants and the supply chain.\n\nIn the shorter term, the Group aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its  vehicles  by  25%  by  2022  compared  with  the  2010  level  (see 2.2.3.A), and is committed to reducing the environmental impacts of its products  throughout  their  life  cycle  from  generation  to generation (see 2.2.2.A).\n\nThis voluntary and proactive effort is not just the result of Renault's historical  commitment  to  sustainable  development  benefiting  the greatest number  of  people.  Environmental  performance  has increasing  financial  implications  and  is  a  determining  factor  in  the Company's competitiveness, as demonstrated by the second pillar of Groupe Renault's Environmental Policy.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY OF GROUPE RENAULT\n\nPrevent and continuously reduce the environmental footprint and health impacts of our products, services and operations, integrating life cycle assessment and circular economy principles.\n\nActively contribute to Groupe Renault competitiveness and to the protection of material and immaterial assets.\n\nImplement environmental management company-wide and across the value chain in order to ensure continuous improvement and compliance to regulations and to voluntary commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n02",

(1)\n\nRenault has made  environmental  management  part  of  its environmental  policy  since  1995.  This  approach  is  implemented Company-wide and throughout  the  life-cycle  of  its  vehicles.  These efforts  are  made  possible  by  the  presence  of  an  environmental network  at  all  Group  plants  and  operations  throughout  the  world. The  2013  update  of  the  Groupe  Renault  environmental  policy  has reaffirmed and expanded the scope of this managerial approach to the entirety of the Company's value chain.\n\nThe  roll-out  of  the  environmental  component  of  the  strategic midterm plan by the Strategic Environmental Planning department covers all of Groupe  Renault's activities and supports its development  strategy  for  new  products  and  services,  including electric,  connected  and  autonomous  vehicles  and  vehicle-to-grid services.\n\n## Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) A.\n\nSince 2005, Renault  has  been  committed  to  reducing  the environmental impact of its vehicles throughout their life-cycle, from one  generation  to  the  next.  In  order  to  ensure  and  monitor compliance  with  this  commitment,  since  2004,  Groupe  Renault measures the environmental impact of its vehicles throughout their life-cycle, from the extraction of the raw materials needed for their manufacture until their end-of-life. Life-Cycle Assessments (LCA) are therefore performed:\n\n- prior  to  the  vehicle  design  process,  to  analyze  the  potential P environmental impact and benefits of technological innovations;\n- after the design process, to confirm and measure the reduction of P environmental impacts from one generation of vehicle to another.\n\nAt  end-2020,  28  models  representing  nearly  80%  of  the  Group's global passenger car sales under the Renault, Dacia, Alpine and RSM (Renault  Samsung  Motors)  brands  were  thus  subjected  to  a complete  LCA.  Starting with the launch of TWINGO III  in September 2014, all new models are subjected to a comparative LCA\n\nI\n\nwith respect to their predecessor. Each of these LCAs is subjected to a  critical  review  by  an  independent  expert  following the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards, to evaluate, firstly, the methodology used and, secondly, all of the calculations and interpretations performed. The LCA  reports  for  new  models,  together  with  their  reviews,  are  put online on the website www.group.renault.com/en/ourcommitments/.\n\nFor further methodological details, please refer to section 2.6.1.1.\n\nThe  chart  below  presents  the  results  of  the  comparative  life-cycle assessment of New ZOE (2019) and CLIO V (2019), in the form of a comparison  by  normalization.  Normalization  consists  in  measuring the  relative  weight  of  the  vehicle  studied  in  relation  to  the environmental  impact  of  an  'average'  European  citizen  over  a reference  year.  The  results  of  the  LCA  illustrate  the  pertinence  of electric vehicles in the fight against global warming: over the entire life cycle, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions stands at 28% for  ZOE  compared  with  CLIO  V,  based  on  an  average  European electricity  mix  for  battery  recharging.  With  the  electricity  mix  in France, the reduction was 64%. The influence of the electricity mix used  for  recharging  on  the  final  result  is  also  notable  for  the acidification potential indicator, with a reduction of 41% for a ZOE recharged  with  the  French  electricity  mix,  compared  with  a  ZOE recharged with the average European mix. Indicators whose relative weight  in  the  normalization  is  lower  are  nonetheless  useful  for identifying  and  prioritizing  the  actions  to  be  taken  to  reduce environmental impacts. Thus, the indicator of potential depletion of mineral  resources  shows  a  negative  impact  related  to  the manufacture  of  the  electric  vehicle  traction  battery.  To  meet  this challenge,  the  Group  is  leveraging  various  options:  maximizing battery use (smart charging, bidirectional charging, second-life uses such  as  stationary  energy  storage),  and  participating  in  the development of new recycling solutions for active battery materials, thereby helping reduce the need for virgin materials.",

Renault's policy is to integrate this concern not only within the normal development process which structures the designers' work, but also to involve component and materials suppliers.\n\nEco-design of Groupe Renault's vehicles involves in particular:\n\n- the  reduction  of  vehicle  mass,  fuel  consumption  and  pollutant P emissions;\n- the possibility of recycling 85% of the vehicle's mass at end-of-life P and  to  recover  95%  of  this,  which  requires  the  ability  to  easily identify and separate the recyclable materials and reusable parts during the dismantling process;\n- the use of recycled materials, which minimizes the consumption of P virgin materials and the associated environmental impacts;\n- the possibility of renovating powertrains or certain parts of them P (remanufacturing)  by  facilitating  dismantling  and  assessment  of their components;\n- the minimization of the noise generated by the vehicle; P\n- the elimination of potentially toxic substances from vehicles and P the manufacturing process;\n- the provision of eco-driving aids in the vehicles. P\n\nConsidering that 60% of a vehicle is composed of purchased parts, eco-design is based largely upon the involvement and cooperation of our suppliers, guided by the Alliance Purchasing Organization, based notably on the application of Renault Green Purchasing Guidelines, which describe expectations in environmental matters. (see 2.5.2).\n\n## Logistics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnvironmental management in matters of logistics has been in place since 2010 and  involves  the  measurement  and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated  with  the  transportation  of parts intended for our industrial facilities and finished vehicles from our factories  to  their  distribution  outlets, through  the  Logistics  ECO2  plan  (see 2.2.3.A).\n\nIn  addition,  logistics  loops  for  reusable  packaging  have  been introduced  when  their  economic  and  environmental  impact  is positive,  to  lessen  our  reliance  on  single-use  packaging  and  the waste it creates.\n\nI\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroupe Renault has selected a seamless approach. The environmental network is Company-wide. It establishes links between environmental  activities and  other processes  in  the  Company  as  well  as between the sites, so as to encourage the dissemination of best practices and the sharing of expertise.\n\nThe industrial  environment  network  is  composed  of  approximately 230 members spread over 13 countries and 44 sites and subsidiaries. It  covers  manufacturing  occupations  as  well  as  all  of  the  Group's industrial sites.\n\nThe  AVTOVAZ  sites  (Togliatti  and  Izhevsk),  in  which  Renault acquired  a  majority  stake  at  the  end  of  2016,  are  being  gradually integrated  into  the  Group's  environmental  reporting  scope.  Action plans  covering  all  environmental  issues  were  prepared  based  on diagnostics  performed  in  2017  and  2018  by  third  parties  (Deloitte and EY). In order to ensure the convergence of these action plans, a governance  committee  including  members  from  the  production facilities  and  central  functions  has  been  set  up  and  meets  on  a monthly  basis.  In  addition,  support  missions  for  local  teams  by corporate  environment  experts  are  conducted  to  guarantee  the proper  roll-out  of  the  Group's  environmental  standards.  These initiatives  continued  in  2020,  despite  the  health  situation,  which reduced the possibilities for experts to travel to the sites. Following the publication in 2019 of a first batch of indicators in line with the Groupe  Renault  environmental  reporting  protocol,  the  scope  of coverage has been extended and additional indicators are published for the 2020 financial year (see methodology and summary table in Appendix  2.6.1.2).  The  Group  aims  to  report  all  indicators  for  the 2021 financial year.\n\nEnvironmental management  at  Groupe  Renault  plants  is underpinned by five pillars:\n\n## Continuous improvement based on ISO/uni00A014001 1.\n\nStarting  in  1995,  Renault  began  systematically  implementing  an environmental management approach at its sites, along with a drive for continuous improvement, based on ISO 14001. This was done to reduce  environmental  impact  and  ensure  regulatory  compliance. Since 2008, all of Groupe Renault's 29 industrial sites and the eight main  engineering  and  logistics  facilities  have  been  ISO 14001 certified.\n\nThe standard has been rolled-out in its most recent version (2015) for all Groupe Renault's ISO 14001 certified sites.\n\n## Group-wide tools and standards 2.\n\nIndustrial  standards  covering  all  areas  related  to  the  environment define  the  minimum  requirements  that  apply  to  the  Group's  sites (See 'Eco-design of industrial processes' below). These ensure that practices are standardized and reflect and adhere to the Company's policies  and  objectives  in  terms  of  the  environment,  no  matter  in which country the sites are located. This is particularly important in countries without a stringent regulatory framework.",

        "page_content": "For environmental management and the handling of chemicals, the sites can also rely on the availability of standardized tools managed by expert functions. These tools include:\n\n- an  expert  system  called  \u00c9corisques,  available  worldwide  in  the P main  languages  used  within  the  Group.  The  system  determines and ranks the environmental impact from activities and potential hazards  in  relation  to  the  plants'  chemical  risk  and  prioritizes them in the plants' environmental action plan;\n- a  reporting  system  for  environmental  impacts  and  energy P consumption (R2E);\n- a  CHEMIS  database  (Chemical  Information  System),  available  in P the main languages used within the Group, for the management of  hazardous  substances  and  the  prevention  of  chemical  risks. CHEMIS  is  the  key  tool  in  Groupe  Renault  chemical  risk management process, which aims, from both environmental and health standpoints, to introduce chemicals safely, to prevent the risks associated with their use, and to anticipate technological and regulatory changes (see 2.2.3.C.b);\n- a process to monitor and track compliance with national and EU P environmental legislation;\n- a  documentary  database  of  Environmental  standards  and  best P practices, accessible from any Group site.\n\nThe  Group  also  adopted  a  new  framework,  finalized  in  2020:  the eight  environmental  golden  rules,  associated  with  50  key  points, which  will  begin  to  be  rolled  out  in  2021  (see  Section  2.4.2.4 Environment ).\n\n## Eco-design of industrial processes 3.\n\nEach  industrial  project  is  monitored  by  a  trio  of  project  managers who  ensure  that  the  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  the Group's technical policies in terms of environmental protection and industrial  hygiene,  energy  optimization  and  the  prevention  of  fire and explosion risks are taken into account at every step. At any time during  the  project,  it  is  thus  possible  to  check  and  validate  the proper consideration of HSE expectations and to sound the alert in the event of deviation in order to define appropriate action plans.\n\nThese technical business policies are based on the state of the art as well  as  the  most  stringent  international  regulatory  or  normative frameworks  (French  legislation  on  installations  classified  for environmental protection, the European  industrial emissions directive (IED) and REACH regulation, the ATEX directive, America's NFPA fire protection standards, etc .)  and  are  updated regularly. To complement this shared base of minimum requirements applicable to all Group sites, breakthrough technologies may be introduced at certain  sites  or  projects  according  to  constraints  or  opportunities related  to  the  local  environment,  as  illustrated  by  the  examples below.\n\n## Plants eco-designed to respect their local environment\n\nAs a result of the Group's international expansion, new plants have been built in emerging countries in recent years, in order to take advantage  of  dynamic  local  markets.  The  design  of  each  of  these  facilities  has  benefited  from  Group  best  practices  and  the  latest technological  advances in  the  environmental  field.  It  takes  into  account  the  specific  local  environmental  constraints  and  sensitivities, identified by an impact study at the outset of the project.\n\nFor example, the plants of Tangiers in Morocco (2012) and Chennai in India (Renault-Nissan, 2010), two countries subject to water stress, use  the  most  advanced  technologies  to  recycle  all  industrial  wastewater,  such  that  no  industrial  wastewater  is  discharged  into  the environment and external water supply requirements are reduced to a strict minimum (see 2.2.3.D). The Tangiers site is also equipped with a biomass boiler fueled by local agricultural waste (waste from the production of olive oil and from wood chippings, in particular from  the  site's  packaging  waste).  As  the  National  Office  of  Electricity  and  Drinking  Water  (ONEE)  provides  the  plant  with  electricity produced from entirely renewable sources, 92% of the plant's energy needs are as a result met by renewable sources, meaning that the emission of more than 86,000 metric tons of CO2 was avoided in 2020.\n\nIn  addition  to  new  plants,  applying  eco-design  to  manufacturing processes  can  also  benefit  existing  facilities.  Since  2015,  Groupe Renault has therefore been conducting the widespread deployment of LED lighting to replace industrial lighting on a number of its sites (see map below).\n\nThe reduction in electricity use through the use of LED lighting can reach 65% compared with the technology it replaces. For the whole of the Europe scope covered at end-2020, this equates to electricity savings of nearly 100,000 MWh for each full year.\n\n## Anticipating industrial, regulatory and environmental 4. developments\n\nThe  E&HSE  (Energy  &  Health,  Safety,  Environment)  master  plans launched  in  2002  describe  the  situation  at  each  site  and  how  it  is likely  to  evolve  over  the  next  10 years,  factoring  in  external constraints such as the ecological sensitivity of the environment and future  regulatory  requirements.  They  contribute  to  the  dialog between  industrial  strategy,  engineering,  building  project  owners and the plants to ensure that each project contributes to reducing the environmental impact of sites.\n\nI\n\n02",

These  complement  the  external  audits  performed annually by a certified independent body.\n\nInternal audits are therefore conducted by members of the industrial environmental  network  (environmental  managers  and  business specialists),  using  joint  audits  that  encourage  exchanges  of  best practice between plants and stimulate improvements in environmental performance.\n\nAs of end-2020, the network had 55 internal environmental auditors who  were  specifically  trained  and  qualified  in  accordance  with ISO 14001 and knowledge of the various environmental topics. Each new auditor embarks on a progressive skills development path until eventually becoming an audit manager.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sales and after-sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Retail Group, the distributor of the  Renault,  Dacia,  Alpine  and  Nissan brands  in  13  European  countries,  set up  an  environmental  management policy in 2007.\n\nAn  RRG  environment  manager  is responsible for training and coordinating a network of environment correspondents in France and Europe.\n\nHe/she provides a set of environmental management best practices, which  are  available  on  the  RRG  intranet.  RRG  has  also  provided reporting in France since 2011 and in Europe since 2013, regarding the environmental impact of its establishments. A summary of this reporting is provided in appendix 2.6.1.4.\n\nRenault also provides support in these efforts to its dealer network and  franchises.  In  France,  the  Sales  department  (DCF)  provides information  and  coordinates  exchange  of  best  practice  through annual  Environment  Club  meetings  in  each  regional  center.  RRG environment managers participate in and contribute to these clubs.",

Renault  also  finances  its  sales  network's  access  to Autoeco.com,  allowing  sites  to  track  the  amount  of  waste  they produce. Renault is also a partner of the CNPA (National Council of Motor  Industry  Professionals),  which,  as  part  of  the  'Environment Challenge,' provides the sales network with technical support in the implementation  of  environmental  protection  measures  and  the search for financial assistance.\n\nGiven the small size of sales outlets (when compared to the size of the  Group's  industrial  sites),  their  involvement  in  the  ISO 14001 certification  process  is  voluntary,  except  in  South  Korea  where  the distribution  network  is  integrated  into  the  overall  ISO 14001 certification of the Renault Samsung Motors subsidiary.\n\nThe  composition  of  products  used  in  the  Group's  distribution network, and the parts and accessories sold under the various Group brands  around  the  world  are  subject  to  the  same  rigorous  control process  as  the  products  and  parts  used  in  manufacturing  vehicles. This process seeks to protect the health of both the consumers and the workers involved in vehicle maintenance and repair, protect the environment,  and  ensure  compliance  with  regulations  in  force  in countries  where  the  vehicles  are  distributed,  such  as  the  REACH regulation in Europe (see section 2.2.3.C.b).\n\nRenault also offers owners of its vehicles a large range of renovated ('Renault  standard  exchange')  powertrains  and  mechanical  parts, sold  at  a  lower  cost  than  that  of  a  new  part,  but  still  meeting  the same  quality  standards.  In  addition,  used  body  parts  (including hoods,  wings,  headlamp  units, etc. )  collected  in  Indra's  network  of dismantlers and selected by the Ga\u00efa subsidiary, are available as an after-sales  service  to  customers  whose  cars  cannot  be  repaired economically  using  new  parts  only.  These  offers  are  part  of  the circular  economy  approach  implemented  by  Groupe  Renault  to reduce  the  consumption  of  raw  materials  and  environmental footprint  associated  with  its  products  in  their  life-cycle  (see section 2.2.3.B).\n\n## Vehicle use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLife-Cycle Assessments show that more  than  80%  of  the  greenhouse gases and the majority of atmospheric pollutants emitted over the life cycle of an  ICE  vehicle  concern  the  vehicle usage  phase  (see  section 2.2.2.A).  The first solution for reducing these emissions is technological and involves  the  reduction  of  emissions from  internal  combustion  vehicles,  as\n\nwell  as  the  development  and  marketing  of  a  range  of  electric vehicles that do not emit any pollutants or greenhouse gases during use.  Groupe  Renault  therefore  devotes  a  significant  portion  of  its\n\n## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\nResearch  and  Advanced  Engineering  expenses  to  this  field,  which places it among the leaders in the automotive industry in these two domains.\n\nMoreover, the behavior of motorists, and how they use their vehicles, may  be  another  avenue  in  which  considerable  progress  can  be achieved.  Renault  therefore  endeavors  to  promote  eco-driving, which  can  lead  to  significant  reductions  in  energy  spent  and  in greenhouse gas emissions during vehicle use.\n\nThe  actions  and  results  of  the  Company  in  terms  of  reducing emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  and  atmospheric  pollutants  of  ICE vehicles  and  the  promotion  of  eco-driving  are  detailed  in  2.2.3.A 'Energy and climate change' and 2.2.3.C.a 'Air quality.'\n\n## Vehicle end-of-life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince 2015, European Union regulations  require  that  95%  of  the mass of end-of-life vehicles be recovered,  of  which  85%  must  be recycled. In accordance with the principle of extended producer responsibility, automakers are responsible for helping to organize and finance  this  process.  Outside  Europe, other  countries  already  have  such\n\nregulations (South Korea, Turkey, Russia, China) or are preparing to do introduce similar ones.\n\nRenault  is  helping  to  organize  the  collection  and  recycling  of end-of-life  vehicles  everywhere  it  is  required.  This  initiative  takes various  forms,  such  as  establishing  its  own  network  of  authorized collection  and  recycling  centers  for  end-of-life  vehicles,  which Renault  has  done,  notably  in  France,  or  participation  in  a  joint program (carmakers, dismantlers, public authorities) to set up such recycling networks.\n\nIn  all  cases,  the  vehicle  is  picked  up  at  no  cost  to  the  last  owner. Information concerning the methods  for  pollution removal, dismantling and recycling is supplied to the recycling operators and energy  recovery  networks  using  the  web-site  of  the  International Dismantling Information System (www.idis2.com).\n\nAltogether,  the  markets  in  which  Renault  helped  to  collect  and process  end-of-life  vehicles  represented  approximately  59%  of  the Group's global sales in 2020.\n\nRenault has also established partnerships and commercial agreements  for  the  collection,  repair,  second  life  and  recycling  of electric vehicle batteries in accordance  with  the  regulatory requirements arising from manufacturers' increased responsibilities.\n\nMore  information  on  these  activities  is  provided  in  the  section 'Collect,  Sort,  Dismantle,  Direct'  in  section 2.2.3.B'  Resources  and the circular economy.'\n\nI\n\n02",

The  Strategic  Environmental Planning department prepares, deploys and monitors the implementation  of  the  environmental  policy  in  all  sectors  of  the Company. To this end, it uses a network of representatives who are assigned  to  all  Company  departments,  as  well  as  the  expertise network created within the Group in 2010 in areas such as 'energy, environment  and  raw  materials  strategy,'  'vehicle  CO2'  and  'air quality and substances.'\n\n## Resources\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault spends over \u20ac2 billion per year on  Research  and  Development.  Most of  these  resources  are  dedicated  to new  vehicle  development,  a  phase  in which  improvement  of  environmental performance  is  inseparable  from  the standard  product  renewal  process. About \u20ac200 million are allocated yearly to research and advanced engineering in  the  early  stages  of  vehicle  projects.\n\nA substantial portion of this expenditure is allocated to innovations specifically  intended  to  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle emissions. These play a role in the appeal of the products, answer regulatory  requirements  (particularly  in  Europe),  and  represent  an important tool for shrinking Renault's environmental footprint.\n\nOn  the  industrial  side,  Renault  invests  continuously  in  the refurbishment  and  improvement  of  its  facilities  in  terms  of environmental, individual and property protection, and the production  and  distribution  of  energy.  The  operational  expenses associated  to  these  activities  can  be  added  to  these  amounts.  In 2020,  the  health  crisis  severely  constrained  these  investments (closure of sites, impossibility for employees to travel), which totaled around \u20ac18 million.\n\nRenault  also  allocates  financial  resources  to  the  development  of partnerships and equity investments in the area of the environment and  sustainable  development  through  Renault  Environnement,  a subsidiary set up in 2008 and headed by the Group's Vice President, Strategic Environmental Planning.\n\n## Environmental skills and training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault  provides  its  employees  with environmental training and information  adapted  to  their  role  and their needs.\n\nPlant  employees  receive  workstation training, including environmental aspects, particularly chemical  risks arising  from  handling,  storage  and spills,  and the sorting of waste. In the\n\nmajority  of  plants,  this  training  is  done  through  a  specific Dojo (workshop) and involves a hands-on approach to waste management practices  and  the  handling  of  chemical  products  in  day-to-day\n\nI\n\nactivities.  In  addition,  educational  and  awareness-raising  activities on  environmental  protection  regularly  take  place  through  internal communication channels or through weekly team meetings.\n\nIn the engineering functions, employees have access to environmental training linked to their business, provided in the form of internal training modules ( e.g. training for ISO 14001 auditors or design-for-recycling)  or  training  provided  by  a  specialized  external organization  if  a  specific  skill  is  required.  Renault  employees  in France also have access to eco-driving training.\n\n## Environment and competitiveness D.\n\nThe  effort  to  reduce  environmental  impacts  is  still  frequently perceived as a source of additional costs for companies. This is only part of the picture, however, since it does not take into account the positive  impact  on  operating  costs,  product  and  service  offering appeal and the diversification of income streams.\n\n## Reducing operating costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the extremely competitive automobile  market,  keeping  vehicle production costs low is crucial in order to retain a competitive edge.\n\nCosts stemming from energy consumption  and  waste  management at Renault's plants run into the hundreds  of  millions  of  euros  each year.  Optimizing  these  areas  is  thus  a\n\nmeans of both reducing the environmental impact of operations and substantially lowering production costs.\n\nIn 2020, the actions taken to reduce energy consumption in all of the Group's  plants,  under  the  supervision  of  a  dedicated  centralized team  (see  'Manufacturing'  under  section 2.2.3.A,  'Energy  and Climate Change') secured savings of approximately \u20ac10.3 million on the Group's yearly energy bill.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  sorted  and  resold  recyclable  waste  (largely metals),  generating  revenue  of  more  than  \u20ac113 million  in  2020. Substantial potential savings could also be made from the recovery of other more specific waste materials. For example, using recycled solvents  (see  'Manufacturing'  under  section 2.2.3.B)  rather  than virgin ones reduces their cost by 30%.\n\nIncreased use of recycled materials and efforts to reduce exposure to critical  raw  materials  are  also  part  of  the  process  of  keeping  costs low.\n\nReducing  exposure  to  virgin  materials  has  become  all  the  more important given both the extreme volatility and long-term upward trend of primary raw material prices. These less foreseeable changes are  only  partially  passed  on  in  vehicle  sales  prices  due  to  the intensely competitive environment. They thus have a direct impact on  the  Group's  operating  profit  (see  section 2.2.3.B).  Setting  up 'short  loops'  for  the  recycling  of  materials  within  the  Group's business  scope  (see  'Recycling:  Develop  new  recycling  routes,  use recycled  materials'  in  section 2.2.3.B)  is  therefore  a  means  of reducing both the cost of purchasing raw materials and the Group's exposure to the volatility of their prices.",

In  addition,  there is  increasing  societal  concern  about the  urgency  of  combating  climate change,  and  about  the  health  effects of  products  and  industrial  processes. These concerns can have a significant effect on market structure. The decline\n\nin the share of diesel engines in the sales mix is one example of this.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  Group  is  drawing  up  prospective  scenarios  in order  to  ensure  that  its  products  and  services  fulfill  market expectations, based on:\n\n- the  collection  of  data  on  public  policy  by  a  global  network  of P correspondents, including regulations, tax and road rules;\n- external  partnerships  ( e.g. specialist  bodies,  NGOs)  to  anticipate P changes  in  stakeholder  expectations  (including  customers,  users and territories);\n- carrying out studies to map local and national initiatives, and to P analyze the potential impacts on the automotive market and the mobility market as a whole.\n\nThese  structural  changes  are  taken  into  account  in  the  Group strategy and incorporated in the strategic plan both as opportunities and  competitiveness  drivers.  They  include  the  electrification  of internal combustion engines, the ecosystem of electric vehicles and batteries, and new mobility services.\n\nFuel consumption is one of the 10 main reasons for buyers to choose a  Renault vehicle, according to surveys conducted of customers on Renault's  main  markets.  Renault's  determination  to  reduce  its vehicles' fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in use means that it is able  to  offer  one  of  the  passenger  car  ranges  with  the  lowest emissions in Europe (see section 2.2.3.A), which gives it a significant competitive advantage.\n\nIn addition, Renault is developing new tools and services that enable customers  to  limit  their  fuel  consumption  (embedded  tools  and\n\n## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\neco-driving  training,  see  the  section  on  'Eco-driving'  under section 2.2.3.A) and to prolong vehicle life at a competitive price by offering  an  economical  option  for  refurbished  parts  of  guaranteed quality (see the section on 'Re-use' under section 2.2.3.B). Through these  tools  and  services  Renault  is  not  only  aiming  to  reduce  its environmental  footprint,  it  is  also  working  to  increase  customer loyalty.\n\n## New business areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorking  to  find  ways  to  both  reduce environmental  impacts  and  optimize the  Group's  economic  resources  has led  Renault  to  explore  areas  which complement  its  core  business,  which has opened up new business opportunities, as demonstrated by the Re-Factory  project  announced  at  the end of 2020 (see box below).\n\nAlthough  the  Choisy  plant,  which  specializes  in  the  renovation  of powertrain  parts,  has  been  in  operation  for  nearly  70 years,  the creation  of  the  Renault  Environnement  subsidiary  in  2008  reflects this  momentum.  Through  its  subsidiaries,  Renault  Environnement works in the following areas:\n\n- recycling of end-of-life vehicles (Indra, joint-venture with Suez); P\n- industrial waste  management  for  plants  (Boone  Comenor P Metalimpex, joint-venture with Suez);\n- recovering  parts  and  materials  through  recycling  networks, P repairing  or  refurbishing  batteries  from  electric  vehicles  and selling of refurbished parts (Ga\u00efa).\n\nIn 2020, these three activities of Renault Environnement (described in  greater  detail  in  2.2.3.B  'Resources  and  the  circular  economy') generated revenues of \u20ac454 million. Each of these activities had a net  positive  result  in  2020,  despite  the  challenges  related  to  the health crisis..\n\nFurthermore,  standard  exchange  parts  (described  in  2.2.3.B) generated revenues of \u20ac106 million in 2020.\n\n## RE-FACTORY, the first European circular economy plant dedicated to mobility\n\nIn November 2020, Groupe Renault announced the creation of the RE-FACTORY on  its  site  in  Flins.  This  project  is  part  of  the  Group's transformation strategy, and builds on its pioneering commitment to the circular economy. It aims to develop a competitive industrial model for sustainable mobility, based on the value-creation potential generated by a vehicle throughout its life.\n\nRolled out between 2021 and 2024, the RE-FACTORY will draw on a large network of multi-sector partners (start-ups, academics, major groups, local authorities, etc .) and will be structured around four areas of activity, whose expertise will support the vehicle throughout its life.\n\nRE-TROFIT: this division will combine all the activities making it possible to extend the life of vehicles and their uses, in coordination with the Re-Cycle division, to ensure efficient management of the flow of used parts and materials within the company on a single site. It will include a used vehicle factory for the reconditioning of used vehicles, a retrofit activity for the conversion of internal combustion engine vehicles to other less carbon-intensive energies, repair services for vehicle fleets and new mobility solutions, as well as a manufacturing service for scarce parts using 3D printers. It will also rely on a vehicle and material sustainability testing and prototyping center to enrich the design of future vehicles and propose improvements during use.\n\nI\n\n02",

This  is  why  Groupe Renault's environmental policy aims to reconcile product and service offerings  with  environmental  protection,  to  deploy  environmental management throughout the Group, eliminate or reduce environmental impacts and organize environmental communication. All of these provisions are subject to annual monitoring, carried out jointly  by  the  signatories  of  the  framework  agreement,  based  on indicators (see section 2.4.1.4).\n\nThe Vigilance plan linked to supplier and subcontractor activities is covered in section 2.5.2 'Strengthening the responsible purchasing approach in the supply chain.'\n\n## Risk mapping /uni00A0DV1a/uni00A0 /uni00A0DV2a/uni00A0\n\nAs  regards  to  obligations  under  the  Duty  of  Vigilance,  Groupe Renault has identified the main environmental risk factors that may impact the ecosystems or exposed persons that are a potential result of  the  Group's  activities  or  the  activities  of  its  suppliers  and subcontractors. Among these macro risk factors, particular attention is paid to:\n\n- the use of water resources (see section 2.2.3 D); P\n- pollutant discharges into water and the natural environment (see P section 2.23.D);\n- the  generation  of  waste  and  its  management  in  ad  hoc P infrastructures, in particular hazardous waste (see section 2.2.3.B);\n- the pollution of soil and groundwater (see section 2.2.3.E); P\n- air  pollution  linked  to  the  use  of  chemicals  or  processes  that P generate atmospheric pollutants (see section 2.2.3.C.a);\n- climate change (see 2.2.3.A). P\n\nThe  Group  decided  to  include  climate  change  in  its  Vigilance  plan although the topic differs from those listed in the law.\n\nWhere  appropriate, risks are prioritized according to local characteristics (groundwater sensitivity, water stress zones,\n\nI\n\nprocesses  with  high  use  of  chemicals, etc. )  and  regulations  put  in place by local authorities (ICPE, SEVESO, etc. ).\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nWith regard to manufacturing activities, which potentially generate the  greatest  environmental  risks,  analyses  are  carried  out  through the  '\u00c9corisques'  computerized  expert  system,  whose  approach  is both  qualitative  (sensitivity,  organization,  training  and  chemical, toxicological  and  ecological  approach)  and  quantitative  (noise, natural  resources,  waste,  emissions,  wastewater,  chemicals).  The \u00c9corisques system makes it possible to evaluate and prioritize risks and potential impacts generated by the site's activities in the context of  a  life-cycle  and  the  implementation  of  corrective  measures  to minimize those risks.\n\nThe risk mapping carried out through \u00c9corisques is an integral part of  the  ISO 14001-certified  Environmental  Management  System (EMS) implemented at each industrial site.\n\n## Other activities\n\nFor  engineering  and  testing,  logistics,  and  spare  parts  storage activities, the largest centers managing these activities perform risk mappings  similar  to  the  one  described  above  through  the Environmental Management System.\n\nAs  regards  the  sales  and  after-sales  activities  controlled  by  the Group, risk analyses are performed in the major countries under the Site Management System, some of which are ISO 14001-certified.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate  change  linked  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  is  understood both locally (exposure of sites to extreme climate phenomena) and globally.  The  Group  has  analyzed  its  challenges,  particularly  the implications  of  the  COP 21  Paris  agreement  for  the  automotive sector,  and  translated  the  risks  and  opportunities  so  they  can  be taken  into  account  in  the  Company's  strategy  and  product  and services offering.",

Every  year,  action  plans  are  put  in  place  to  continuously  improve environmental  performance  and  reduce  risks.  Obtaining  ISO 14001 certification from  an  independent  third  party  validates  the effectiveness,  pertinence  and  adequacy  of  the  Environmental Management System.\n\n## Other activities\n\nThe largest  centers  that  manage  engineering,  testing  and  logistics activities  have  the  same  organizational  structure  as  the  industrial sites. At the other sites, this structure is not fully deployed given the lower level of environmental risk.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe  physical  risks  associated  with  extreme  weather  events,  the frequency and intensity of which are likely to change as a result of the global rise  in  temperature,  are  taken  into  account  in  the  same way  as  other  natural  and  industrial  risks  as  part  of  the  Group's prevention policy (see 'Taking account of climate change issues' in 2.2.3.A.\n\nIn line with the targets set according to the COP 21 Paris Agreement, Groupe Renault is also implementing a strategy to reduce its carbon footprint  throughout  the  life  cycle  of  its  products  by  reducing  the CO2 emissions from combustion engines, deploying electric vehicles and  their  ecosystem  (second  life  and  smart  battery  recharging), deploying  new  mobility  services,  developing  circular  economy activities and improving the energy efficiency of its industrial facility and logistics on an ongoing basis.\n\n## System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness /uni00A0DV5a/uni00A0\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nFor  manufacturing  activities,  several  levels  of  control  over  the implementation  and  effectiveness  of  the  action  plan  have  been established:\n\n- an initial level of internal control at each site is carried out within P the context of the Environmental Management System;\n\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\n- a second  level  of  control  is  performed  through  internal P Environmental  Management  System  audits  by  teams  of  two  to four  Renault  auditors  from  other  sites.  These  audits  cover  the requirements of ISO 14001 on various environmental topics (soil, water, air, waste, energy, chemicals, legionella risk, noise and risk prevention). Upon receipt of the Audit Report, the audited entity defines the action plan to address each point of non-compliance. The completion and effectiveness of the action plan are verified during the next annual audit;\n- a  third  level  of  control  and  monitoring  of  the  implemented P measures is performed through an external annual audit carried out  by  an  independent  accredited  body  as  part  of  obtaining ISO 14001 certification;\n- finally, the environmental data for each site (quantities of waste, P wastewater  and  atmospheric  emissions,  water  and  energy consumption)  are  reported  via  a  Group  system.  These  data  are audited  and  validated  annually  by  another  independent  audit body.\n\n## Other activities\n\nAs regards to engineering and testing activities, sales and after-sales activities  in  Europe  and  South  Korea,  spare  parts  storage  facilities, the  largest  centers  managing  these  activities  have  the  same organizational structure as the industrial sites.\n\n## Climate change\n\nA global carbon footprint reduction indicator throughout the whole vehicle  life  cycle  enables  to  manage  action  plans  and  provides  a concise overview of the Group's contribution to the decarbonization of  the  automotive  sector.  The  progress  of  the  various  action  plans which support this carbon footprint reduction target is measured by quantified  performance  indicators.  The  carbon  footprint  indicator covers  Groupe  Renault's  own  performance  and  also  those  of  its suppliers, particularly production and logistics activities.\n\nThe  CO2  emissions  of  vehicles  during  the  use  phase  account  for  a significant portion of the carbon footprint, so reducing these is high on the Company's priorities. They are therefore regularly monitored at  the  Group  Board  of  Management  level  (position  with  regard  to CAFx regulations).\n\nAction plans, results and associated indicators are shown in sections 2.2.3 'Environmental impact: actions and indicators' (sub-sections A, B, D, C.a, E) and 2.2.2 (environmental objectives table: internal audits and ISO 14001 certifications).\n\nI\n\n02",

Some  indicators  relating  to  the  industrial  scope  are  particularly concerned, whether the indicator is expressed in absolute terms or in relation  to  the  number  of  vehicles  produced.  For  example,  energy and  water  consumption  at  production  facilities  is  not  strictly proportional  to  manufacturing  volumes  (the  'heel'  effect),  and  in\n\n2020 that resulted in a clear deterioration in performance per vehicle produced (see 2.2.3.A Energy and climate change and 2.2.3.D Water consumption and quality ).  Similarly,  the  decrease in the number of vehicles produced has a direct impact on the indicator measuring the total  quantity  of  recycled  plastic  incorporated  in  new  vehicles,  and also  reduces  the  quantity  of  recoverable  metallic  waste,  thereby affecting the 'Technical and economic value of parts and materials preserved  in  the  automotive  sector  through  circular  economy activities' indicator (see 2.2.3.B Resources and the circular economy for both indicators ).\n\n## Energy and climate change /uni00A0EFPD11c/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD12a/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD12b/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD12c/uni00A0 A.\n\nObjective\n\n| Environmental objectives   | Environmental objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   set |   Deadline | Status as of year-end 2020                                                                                                                     | New environmental objectives                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| All segments               | Reduce the carbon footprint  (1)  of Groupe Renault vehicles  sold worldwide by an average of 25% between 2010 and  2022                                                                                                                            |  2017 |       2022 | -19.6% (compared to 2010)                                                                                                                      | Beyond 2022, the Group will continue to monitor this indicator, with a progress trajectory at least equal to that undertaken since 2017.                                                     |\n| Product                    | Worldwide: reduce the tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions of PC  and LCV ranges by 25% between 2010 and 2022 in order to  meet the Group's carbon footprint reduction objectives and  to comply with the regulatory requirements for the relevant  markets. |  2017 |       2022 | -20.2% (compared to 2010)                                                                                                                      | World: reduce the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions of Group vehicles by 45% between 2010 and 2030.

The Group  considers  the  recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's\n\nTask-Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to be an appropriate frame of reference for communicating these issues to the various  stakeholders  in  order  to  promote  the  transition  to  a low-carbon  economy.  In  2019,  the  Group  decided  to  support  this initiative.\n\nThe following summary  presents the Group's progress in implementing  these  recommendations.  It  aims  to  supplement  the cross-reference table presented in note 2.6.1.5. This table also refers to  the  Group's  responses  to  the  CDP  (formerly Carbon  Disclosure Project )  \"Climate  Change\"  and  \"Water  Security\"  questionnaires  for which  the  frameworks  have  been  aligned  with  the  TCFD's recommendations since 2018. The Group's responses are public and may be accessed at www.cdp.net.\n\nThe  agreement  signed  in  2015  following  the  Paris  Climate Conference  (COP  21) and  the  national  commitments  published  at the time were subjected to an in-depth analysis of their implications for  the  automotive  industry  as  soon  as  they  were  announced.  The associated opportunities and risks were presented to the Executive Committee (renamed the Board of Management in January 2021) for inclusion in the Group strategy and product plan.\n\nIn 2015, the Board of Directors and its Committee studied Renault's emissions  strategy,  the  Group's  electrification  strategy  and  the impact of new European regulations on emissions (WLTP, Worldwide harmonized Light vehicle Test Procedure).\n\nIn 2019, the Group's Board of Directors reinforced its governance of environmental issues still further by setting up the specialized Ethics and  CSR  Committee,  with  one  of  its  tasks  being  to  ensure  a  high level of commitment to extra-financial compliance, ethics and social and environmental responsibility, with a transversal vision covering all Company activities.\n\nThe Group has clearly identified the risks and opportunities related to climate change as a major competitiveness topic for the company, and in particular :\n\n- risks  and  opportunities  linked  to  the  impact  of  the  evolution  of P regulatory and normative requirements related to environmental performance  of  vehicles  and/or  industrial  processes  and,  more\n\n## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\nbroadly,  greenhouse  gas  emissions  reduction  targets  defined  in the context of the COP 21 agreement;\n\n- risks  and  opportunities  related  to  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon P economy: risk of mismatch between the product/service offer and market  expectations,  risk  of  loss  of  competitiveness  of  certain products, but also opportunity to gain competitiveness on electric and electrified  vehicles,  opportunity  to  develop  new  electric  and shared  mobility  services  to  support  the  transformation  of  uses, improve air quality and reduce congestion in cities;\n- physical risks, which are less material for the Group: exposure of P sites to extreme  weather  events  with  potential  negative consequences  on  industrial  and  logistical  activities,  supply  and insurance premiums, in particular flooding (e.g. the French plants in Choisy-le-Roi and Flins, located near the Seine), hurricanes (e.g. the Busan plant in South Korea) and hailstorms (in particular the Santa Isabel plant in  Cordoba,  Argentina,  the  Valladolid  plant  in Spain, the Flins plant in France, the Revoz plant in Slovenia and the Pitesti plant in Romania).\n\nIn the short term, meeting the regulatory targets for reducing CO2 emissions  from  vehicles in  Europe  is  a  financial  and  reputational issue and therefore a priority objective for the Group.\n\nTo meet this European CAFE objective, the Group has the following levers at its disposal:\n\n- a pioneer position in electric vehicles: the Group can build on more P than 10 years' experience in design, manufacture, sale and after sales,  with  30,000  employees  trained  in  the  specific  features  of electric vehicles and a total of more than 400,000 electric vehicles sold.

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT: A/uni00A0COMPANY THAT ACTS RESPONSIBLY\n\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\nThe strategy and organization described above enabled the Group to  achieve  its  CAFE  targets  for  passenger  cars  and  light commercial  vehicles  in  2020 (1) . The  risk, in the event  of non-compliance  with  the  European  objective  of  a  CAFE  per manufacturer of 95g of CO2/km in 2020, would have been a financial penalty  of  \u20ac95  per  gram  and  per  vehicle,  i.e.  an  overall  amount  of some \u20ac110 million per gram of overrun (based on PC sales volumes in 2020).\n\nOutside  Europe,  the  Group  is  also  subject  to  similar  regulatory constraints. In total, around 70% of the Group's sales worldwide are thus subject to CAFE-type regulations.\n\nBeyond the Europe stake, for which the levers are presented above, the Group's environmental midterm plan is based on three strategic axes:\n\n- the development of the electrification of vehicles (100% electric, P hybrid  and  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles)  and  services  provided  by batteries to the energy sector (second life and smart charging) to enable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while promoting the growth of renewable energy;\n- the development of the circular economy that meets the need to P preserve natural resources and contributes to reducing the energy consumption (and, therefore, indirect greenhouse gas emissions) used in the extraction of raw materials and production of goods;\n- lastly,  the  development  of  new  electric  and  shared  mobility P services.\n\nThe Group uses an internal carbon pricing mechanism to drive the reduction in its CO2 emissions. This internal carbon price depends on the scope considered:\n\n- for vehicle  projects ,  the  definition  of  the  carbon  price  notably P includes  regulations  on  emissions  in  use  such  as  CAFE  and  CO2 related taxation. For example, the carbon price taken into account to  make  decisions  on  technical  carbon  reduction  solutions  in vehicle  projects  in  Europe  is  around  \u20ac450/metric  ton.  This  value takes into account, among other factors, regulatory issues and tax frameworks attached to each market.\n- for industrial installations ,  it  takes into account multiple factors P such as expected changes in the energy market and CO2 emissions quotas: over half of the Group's direct emissions are concerned by the EU-ETS quota exchange system, for which the average price in 2020  was  around  \u20ac25/t  CO2.  For  further  details  on  the management of EU-ETS quotas, refer to the section 'Manufacturing', below.\n\nMoreover, in the Company's internal process, life cycle assessments (LCA) or carbon assessments are carried out regularly to assess and decide  between  different  strategic  options  (for  example,  which mobility service model has the most positive impact on areas such as cities?)  or  different  technological  options,  by  model  or  region,  for\n\nexample  comparative  LCAs  of  batteries,  powertrain  technologies (electric,  plug-in  hybrid,  hydrogen,  LPG,  NGV,  biogas)  or  the assessment  of  the  environmental  benefits  related  to  the  circular economy.  The  prevailing  logic  in  these  assessments  is  that  only vehicles or services offering mobility with the lowest possible carbon footprint  will  be  successful  in  the  marketplace,  or  be  favored  by regulations or taxation.\n\n## Climate scenarios\n\nTo  prepare  its  decarbonization  trajectory,  the  Group  used  external benchmark data, notably the Energy Technology Perspectives of the International Energy Agency (B2DS \"Beyond 2\u00b0C\" scenario) and the World  Automotive  Powertrain  Outlook  developed  by  the  specialist company, BIPE.\n\nThe Group's 2030 targets for reducing direct and indirect emissions related  to  the  consumption  of  energy  required  for  production (scopes  1  and  2)  and  the  target  for  reducing  emissions  related  to vehicle  use  (scope  3  \"well  to  wheel\")    were officially  approved  by the Science-Based Targets (SBT (2) ) initiative in March 2019: Groupe Renault committed to reducing scope 1 & 2 emissions by 60% per car produced by 2030 from a 2012 base-year, and to reduce scope 3 well-to-wheel emissions by 41% per vehicle kilometer by 2030 from a  2010  base  year.  The  Group's  ongoing  efforts  to  reduce  its emissions have resulted in a revision of this 'well-to-wheel' Scope 3 emissions  reduction  target,  which  is  now  set  at  45%  for  2030 compared with 2010.\n\nThis decarbonization trajectory is the Company's reference climate scenario ,  and  is  consistent  with  the  Paris  COP21  target  of  keeping global  warming  below  2\u00b0C.  This  reference  scenario  is  one  of  the elements  of  the  strategy  deployed  across  all  of  its  activities (industrial facilities and product and service development).\n\nHowever, numerous uncertainties remain as to the future results of the efforts deployed to fight against climate change. The Group has therefore built three alternative climate scenarios in  order  to  test the  robustness  of  its  strategy  against  a  wide  range  of  possible futures in the years to 2050, with intermediate points in 2030 and 2040.  This  work  builds  on  the  forward-looking  analyses  that  the Group conducts continuously, covering a wide range of variables that may impact the Company's business model, including: decarbonization  of  energy  production,  public  policies  (regulations, taxation, regulation of road traffic, notably in cities), availability and speed  of  adoption  of  technologies,  changes  in  the  expectations  of users,  territories  and  other  stakeholders,  and  accessibility  and  cost of resources.\n\nAn  analysis  of  the  risks  and  opportunities  associated  with  these different scenarios will be published in April 2021, in the form of a Climate Report .\n\n- These results will be consolidated and formalized by the European Commission in the coming months. (1)\n- The SBT initiative arose from a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact program, the WRI (World Resources Institute) (2) and WWF (World Wildlife Foundation). The aim is to verify the consistency between greenhouse gas emission reduction targets set by companies and the data from scientific research on climate. Groupe Renault was the first company in the automotive sector to obtain the validation of its decarbonization targets through the SBT initiative.\n\nI",

The\n\nuse of alternative fuels was thus tested (natural gas for vehicles, replacing  diesel),  as  well  as  the  use  of  versatile  trucks  that  can transport vehicles and parts;\n\n- the  reduction  in  the  number  of  kilometers  traveled  (location  of P suppliers  in  the  country  of  production,  optimization  of  logistics flows),  based  on  a  monitoring  indicator  for  each  new  vehicle project,  which  measures  compliance  with  recommendations concerning the location of the 130 most bulky parts;\n- optimizing container load rates and  packaging  based  on P eco-design;\n- developing  rail  and  sea  transport  as  an  alternative  to  road P transport.\n\nProgress on these measures is monitored by dedicated environmental performance committees which are co-chaired by the Director  of  the  Alliance  Supply  Chain  and  the  Vice  President Strategic Environmental Planning.\n\nThe following examples illustrate this:\n\n- optimization  of  the  filling  of  packaging  and  trucks  within  the P central  Europe  scope  was  extended  to  Romania,  Turkey  and Morocco, which has avoided placing 41,400 trucks on the roads, representing 1.4% of upstream transport units;\n- the  mode  change  towards  trains  and  ferries  for  flows  between P France,  Spain,  the  United  Kingdom,  Romania,  Turkey,  Morocco and  Russia  (Moscow  factory),  which  has  avoided  using  about 87,200 trucks, representing 3% of all  upstream transport units;\n- lastly,  for  the  transport  and  distribution  of  new  vehicles,  a P multi-modal  transfer  towards  the  train  between  France,  Spain, Romania and Morocco, which has avoided the use of more than 23,000  trucks,  representing  1.7%  of  all  downstream  transport units.\n\nAll  of  these  actions  have  avoided  emitting  nearly  168,600  metric tons of CO2 (cumulative over the period 2017-2020).\n\nRenault is one of the members of  the Environment and Transport Commission within the AUTF (Association of Freight Transportation Users). As such, the Group has organized multi-company workshops to  identify    environmental  best  practices  and  joint  actions  to  be taken. Renault was one of the first signatories of ADEME's FRET21 Charter in 2015, the purpose of which was to ensure that shippers reduce the CO2 emissions of their transport methods. By end-2017, Renault had met its three-year FRET21 commitment, and was the leading  contributor  in  terms  of  emissions  savings.  In  2019  ADEME awarded  the  Group  its  EVE  trophy  (voluntary  environmental\n\nI\n\ncommitments  -  transport  and  logistics)  for  most  progress  in reducing  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  transportation  of goods for its business.\n\nThe  Group  has  renewed  this  external  commitment  with  ADEME FRET21:  for  the  2019-2021  period,  the  Group's  aim  is  to  reduce supply chain CO2 emissions by 50,000 tonnes.\n\nIn  the  context  of  its  environmental  strategy  aiming  to  reduce  its carbon footprint and that of its supply chain, in 2018 Groupe Renault announced  the  signature  of  a  partnership  with  the  start-up NEOLINE,  a  designer  and  operator  of  cargo  ships  using  sails.  This project plans the construction of two wind-powered cargo ships by 2021, with the aim of commissioning in 2021-2022 on a pilot route which will  connect  St-Nazaire,  the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States and Saint-Pierre & Miquelon. This shipowner project has culminated in the design of a commercial demonstrator capable of reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% compared to a traditional cargo ship on an equivalent voyage, mainly using wind propulsion associated with a cost-cutting speed and optimization of the energy mix.\n\nIn  2020  a  cross-functional  'responsible  logistics'  project  was launched. It ran for 10 months and involved more than 40 employees from  around  ten  departments  within  Renault.  A  broad  scope  was covered,  ranging  from  the  decarbonization  of  transport  to  the circular  economy  of  packaging,  sustainable  procurement,  dialogue with stakeholders, the 'state of mind' of employees, not to mention CO2  measurements.  This  project  will  support  the  Group's  rapid decarbonation trajectory and make it more reliable via:\n\n- a CO2 emissions simulation tool to ensure that targets are met; P\n- a  clear  roadmap  for  the  availability  of  alternative  energies  and P associated engines for heavy goods vehicles;\n- procurement decisions that factor in the CO2 criterion; P\n- identification  of  the  skills  and  training  required  for  sustainable P logistics;\n- new recycling networks for packaging; P\n- dedicated internal communication and a unifying indicator called P Care.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy is largely based on a reduction  in  energy  consumption  and the  development  of  renewable  forms of energy, since over 90% of the sites' emissions  are  the  result  of  energy consumption.  This  strategy,  seen  in both  continuous  improvements  and  in breakthrough actions,  is  based  on  five components:\n\n- the  control  and  reduction  of  energy  consumption  thanks  to  the P contribution of Industry 4.0 tools (see 2.3.3 The Plant in Motion). A special management system has been set up to manage periods with no energy production, with enhanced monitoring through the use of an Energy Management System deployed on industrial sites. The use of  artificial  intelligence  for  the  energy  optimization  of  processes  is also one of the avenues under study;",

For vehicles homologated with the new WLTP procedure, CO2 emissions are converted into NEDC equivalent with the methodology developed by the European Commission ('NEDC back-translation', or NEDC-BT). From 2017 to 2019, the calculation was based on both NEDC and NEDC-BT data, depending on the type of approval of the vehicle concerned.\n\n1995-2017 data: EU, data from the AAA (Association Auxiliaire de l'Automobile) or the European Environment Agency. 2018 data: EU28 and Iceland (which joined CAFE in 2018).\n\nProvisional 2019 and 2020 data: EU27, United Kingdom, Iceland and Norway (which joined CAFE in 2019).\n\nPC, worldwide and All vehicles, worldwide: The CO2 emission values considered by model are those taken for the calculation of the Group carbon footprint indicator: please refer to the description of the scope covered and the data sources in section 2.6.1.1, line 'Use of products sold.'\n\n## Electric vehicles 2.\n\nElectric  vehicles  are  a  major  component  of  Renault's  strategy.  The Company is  targeting  a  large-scale  roll-out  of  this  type  of  vehicle, which  provides  a  real  solution  to  atmospheric  pollution  in  urban areas  by  the  absence  of  pollutant  emissions  during  use (1) (see 'Vehicle  use'  under  section 2.2.3.C.a).  They  can  also  significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation.\n\nThe ZOE (52 kWh) carbon footprint throughout its life-cycle is 28% less than that of an equivalent internal combustion vehicle, based on the average European electric production mix. Moreover, the carbon footprint of each electric vehicle in use, including those on the roads today,  is  set  to  decrease  steadily  over  the  coming  years  given  the planned increase in the share of renewable energy in the European energy mix.\n\nThe  synergies  between  electric  mobility  and  renewable  energy however go far beyond the mere reduction of CO2 emissions related to  battery  charges.  The  challenge  of  widespread  distribution  of electric  vehicles  is  emerging  as  an  integral  part  of  an  optimal integration  of  renewable  energies  in  the  electricity  production  and distribution  'ecosystem,'  at  a  lower  cost  and  providing  maximum benefit in terms of overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate Foundation  and  Cambridge  Econometrics,  intelligent management  of  electric  vehicle  charging  could  contribute  to  the creation of a net profit of \u20ac125 million in 2030 for the French energy system,  while  enabling  greater  integration  of  renewable  energy.  It would  also  make  it  possible  to  add  more  than  20 million  electric vehicles  into  France's  car  fleet  without  resorting  to  additional production capacity.\n\nThe storage capacity that electric vehicle batteries represent could indeed  be  used  to  absorb  surplus  renewable  energy  when  grid demand is lower than production and return the surplus during the consumption  peaks.  These  peaks  determine  the  size  of  electricity production  and  distribution  infrastructures  and  contribute  strongly to greenhouse gas emissions because they are currently covered for the most part by thermal power stations (gas, coal, etc. ).\n\nSuch synergies can be implemented through intelligent management  of  the  charging  of  electric  vehicles  (or  even charges/discharges as part of solutions to power electrical grids or homes from batteries) and through the reuse of second-life batteries in electrical energy storage infrastructures. That is why Renault took part in the European ELSA project aimed at developing a stationary electricity  storage  system  using  second-life  batteries  supplied  by Renault and Nissan.\n\nAccording to the study En route pour un transport durable (Towards Sustainable  Transport)  published  in  late  2015  by  the  European\n\nNeither CO2 nor any other pollutant emissions during use, excluding consumable parts (1)\n\nI",

        "page_content": "Groupe  Renault  has  initiated  two  major  projects  in  Europe  using second-life  battery  technologies,  namely  the  Advanced  Battery Storage projects in France and SmartHubs in the United Kingdom. These  two  projects  are  part  of  the  Group's  strategy  to  develop  a smart  electricity  ecosystem  for  the  energy  transition.  In  2020,  the first  Advanced  Battery  Storage  facility  was  commissioned  at  the Douai site. This project is based on batteries of electric cars stored in containers,  and  targets  installed  capacity  of  nearly  50  MWh  at several  sites  in  France.  For  the  SmartHubs  project  launched  with Connected  Energy  at  the  end  of  2020,  second-life  batteries  from Renault vehicles will be used alongside other technologies as part of a local energy system to provide cleaner and less expensive energy for social housing, transport, infrastructure, private homes and local businesses.\n\n## Electric vehicles in the ecological transition\n\nGroupe Renault was invited by the Fondation pour la Nature et  l'Homme  and  the  European  Climate  Foundation  to  take part  in  the  study  'From  Cradle  to  Grave:  E-mobility  and  the French  Energy  Transition'  alongside  ADEME,  the  R\u00e9seau  de Transport  d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9  (RTE),  the  battery  manufacturer  Saft, Avere-France  (association  for  the  development  of  electric mobility)  and  the  NGOs  R\u00e9seau  Action  Climat  France,  WWF France  and  R\u00e9seau  pour  la  Transition  \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique  (Energy Transition Network) (CLER)\n\nThis study was published in December 2017 and assesses the environmental  impacts  and  benefits  of  electrifying  the automotive  vehicle  fleet  in  France  by  2030.  It  confirms  the environmental  benefits  of  electric  vehicles  in  combating climate change and achieving the targets of the COP 21 Paris agreement. The study also covers how the benefits could be enhanced  by  maximizing  the  use  of  batteries  for  mobility (vehicle-sharing,  increasing  mileage)  and  by  services  to  the grid  ('V2G'  or  'vehicle-to-grid').  Finally,  the  study  explores the  possibility  of  using  second-life  batteries  to  store  energy, thereby  boosting  energy  transition  and  the  development  of renewable energy.\n\n## For further information visit:\n\nhttps://europeanclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ Electric\\_vehicles\\_ENG\\_AW\\_WEB.pdf/.\n\n## Porto Santo: putting a smart electricity ecosystem into practice\n\nOn the Portuguese island of Porto Santo, Groupe Renault and Empresa  de  Electricidade  da  Madeira,  an  energy  supplier, joined forces to launch a smart electricity ecosystem based on four  main  pillars:  electric  vehicles,  stationary  electricity storage, smart charging and reversible charging, with the aim of strengthening the island's energy independence and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nGroupe  Renault  has  assessed  the  impact  of  this  system  in collaboration  with  WWF.  The  conclusion  is  that  the  carbon footprint over the entire life cycle of an electric vehicle in Porto Santo  is  11%  and  34%  lower  than  for  diesel  and  gasoline equivalents respectively. These findings are especially\n\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\nsignificant in that the island's electricity mix is currently based largely on fossil fuels. The study also shows that in the case of a maximum  99.5%  use  of  renewable  energies  combined  with 100% electric mobility, the carbon footprint related to all energy consumption on the island would be reduced by 88% compared to 2018.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  recorded  a  new  94%  increase  in  its  worldwide sales  of  electric  vehicles,  to  121,470  units  (excluding  TWIZY).  The Group confirmed its leading position in Europe, with 115,888 electric vehicles  sold,  double  the  figure  of  the  previous  year.  ZOE  is  the best-selling  electric  car,  with  sales  of  more  than  100,000  units. KANGOO  Z.E.  remains  the  best-selling  electric  light  commercial vehicle, as it has been every year since it was introduced.\n\nThe  Group  offers  a  full  range  with  Renault  TWIZY,  TWINGO  Z.E., ZOE,  KANGOO  Z.E.,  MASTER  Z.E.  and  Dacia  SPRING,  sold  in numerous countries in Europe and elsewhere, as well as the Renault Samsung Motors SM3 Z.E. sedan, sold in South Korea, and Renault K-ZE, an electric A-segment vehicle, urban and affordable, available in  China  since  late  2019  and  manufactured  locally  by  eGT  New Energy Automotive Co, a joint venture created with Dongfeng Motor Group  and  Nissan  in  order  to  develop  and  produce  competitive electric vehicles for the Chinese market.\n\n## Technological eco-driving aids 3.\n\nFuel  consumption  actually  observed  by  the  average  driver  can diverge from  the  certified values, with differences possibly exceeding  20%  depending  on  the  type  of  driving.  This  is  due  to certified  consumption  values  being  calculated  for  standardized cycles that do not reflect all driving styles (more or less aggressive) or all  driving conditions (no heating or air conditioning, fluid urban and suburban traffic).\n\nRenault offers eco-driving assistance solutions in order to close this gap,  so  that  the  actual  consumption  noted  by  its  customers  is  as close as possible to the certified values. This was the impetus behind the creation of Renault's Driving ECO2 program in 2008, which aims to  offer  vehicle-embedded  driving  aids  to  customers,  as  well  as training  services  in  order  to  assist  them  in  reducing  their  fuel consumption through eco-driving.\n\nChanging driver behaviors through eco-driving is one way to reduce energy  consumption  (gasoline,  diesel  or  electricity).  Depending  on driving style, savings of up to 25% could be achieved.\n\nSurveys,  conducted  both  internally  and  externally  to  better understand customers' expectations of embedded eco-driving aids, led to the identification of four driver profiles (see graph below):\n\n- 'participative' drivers, who wish to take an active role by changing P their behavior, and would like information and targeted advice on how to do this;\n- 'delegating' drivers, who are ready to give full responsibility for P reducing their consumption to the vehicle;\n- drivers who are both participative and delegating; P\n- finally, a minority of drivers who state that they have no interest P in any form of eco-driving assistance.\n\nI\n\n02",

In  addition,  it  has  been  voluntarily applied  to  all  vehicles  sold  by  Groupe Renault worldwide.\n\nAccordingly, since the early 2000s, the\n\ndesign  of  Renault  vehicles  has  taken  dismantling  and  recycling requirements into account. For example, dismantling has been made easier by reducing the number of fixing points. Similarly, preference is  given  to  recyclable  materials  for  which  recycling  systems  exist; whenever  possible,  a  single  part  will  not  contain  materials  that cannot be recycled together; and tanks are shaped to allow all fuel and oil to be removed. During the design phase, every vehicle project is monitored by a recycling specialist.\n\nThe  possibility  of  renovating  powertrains  or  certain  of  their  parts (remanufacturing)  is  also  taken  into  consideration  from  the beginning  of  their  design  by  facilitating  the  dismantling  and assessment of their components.\n\nRenault is also working at reducing the amount of materials used in manufacturing its vehicles. Renault has introduced two technological advances to the steel used in vehicle bodies, in order to reduce the consumption of sheet metal:\n\n- the  use  of  sheet  metal  with  high  elastic  limits  (including P hot-pressed steel) reduces the thickness and therefore the mass of the parts;\n- stamping  processes  have  been  optimized  to  improve  material P consumption, i.e., the ratio between the mass of the part and the initial  mass  of  the  metal  blank.  These  processes  allow  smaller blanks to be used to make the same part and generate less metal waste.\n\n## Reducing at source and recovering waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principles  of the  circular  economy,  Renault  has adopted  a  preventive  approach  to achieve the maximum reduction in the environmental impacts associated with waste, through the implementation of the  following  principles,  in  order  of priority:\n\nOUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\n- reduce the  quantity  of  waste  generated  at  source,  by  first P eliminating the source of its creation, where possible: this means that  the  use  of  sustainable  packaging  in  the  transportation  of manufacturing parts is favored over that of single-use packaging, particularly  for  high-volume  parts  and  short  logistical  flows  (the economic  and  carbon  assessments  incorporating  the  return  of empty packaging are not favorable for low volumes transported over long distances).\n\nWhen  the  production  of  waste  cannot  be  avoided,  an  effort  is made to reduce the quantity by separating the portion that is not strictly-speaking  waste  (recoverable  active  substances,  water, etc .). For example, the filtering systems for paint sludge facilitate a reduction in the quantities of waste to be eliminated since they extract the water contained in the sludge. Optimization of sludge drainage at the Palencia plant resulted in a 25% reduction in the ratio of production of paint sludge to vehicles produced between 2018  and  2019.  Similarly,  the  separation  of  dry  matter  and  oils contained in the sludge and the shavings from machining reduces the tonnage of waste and facilitates the recovery of oils that can be reused in the manufacturing process. The installation of a third evaporator-concentrator  at  the  Cl\u00e9on  plant  in  early  2020  will make  it  possible  to  reduce  the  tonnage  of  hazardous  waste  by around 10%;\n\n- reuse spent products, production offcuts and scrap: in assembly P plants, excess anti-corrosion protection waxes are recovered after application,  filtered  and  returned  to  the  production  system. Following the implementation of regeneration of solvents used to rinse  the  painting  robots  on  most  sites,  the  re-use  of  these regenerated  solvents  in  the  paint  lines  is  now  in  place  at  the Batilly,  Maubeuge,  Flins,  Sandouville  (France)  and  Valladolid (Spain) sites. In Colombia, the Medellin plant has been recycling its paint solvents internally since 2014, enabling the plant to almost completely  eliminate  solvent  waste.  As  regards  powertrain manufacturing  sites,  the  Cl\u00e9on  plant  collects  and  regenerates used stamping and hydraulic oils from the Flins plant to use as a substitute  for  new  oils.  When  they  are  in  good  condition,  used wood  pallets  are  re-used  within  the  Company  or  resold  for  the same  purpose.  Ga\u00efa,  a  subsidiary  of  Renault  Environnement, recovers unused end-of-series parts from within the plants, sorts them and sells them;\n- recycle the  materials  contained  within  the  waste.  This  form  of P waste  treatment  can  be  applied  to  most  recoverable  materials (cardboard, plastic, metal, etc .). In this way, metallic waste, which represents  over  70%  of  the  total  production  waste,  is  almost completely  recycled.  Paper,  cardboard  and  plastics  are  also systematically  sorted  for  recycling.  However,  beyond  these 'traditional'  recyclable  waste  categories,  some  more  complex types of waste that may initially appear of no value can also be recycled  through  incorporation  in  the  composition  of  new materials.  Therefore,  ashes  from  the  biomass  boilers  at  the Tangiers plant in Morocco (more than 1,000 metric tons in 2020) are  used  in  bio  fertilizers  certified  for  use  in  organic  farming. Similarly, since mid-2017, the Busan plant in South Korea recycles the  sludge  from  its  treatment  and  phosphating  system  by channeling it into cement manufacturing as a mineral input (more than 600 metric tons in 2020);\n\nI\n\n02",

Renault is seeking to minimize the use of this waste management method. Based on a like-for-like scope of operations, Renault has reduced the quantities of manufacturing\n\nwaste sent to landfill (except demolition waste and foundries) by 47% since 2013. In 2019, Palencia eliminated its last use of landfill channels to reach 'zero landfill'.\n\nTo ensure consistency at a Group-wide level, Renault has drafted a waste table (a codified list of waste produced by sites). This makes it possible to standardize the approach to hazardous and non-hazardous waste internationally.\n\nThe non-achievement of the objective of reducing the quantities of hazardous waste in 2020 is mainly explained by the events linked to the implementation  of  projects  (vehicles  or  capacities)  and maintenance operations. As an example, one can cite the actions to improve water treatment in Bursa, which led to an overproduction of sludge,  or  the  switch  to  nickel-free  phosphate  coating  baths  in Douai, which required the treatment of the old baths as waste.\n\n## WASTE PER CATEGORY AND PROCESSING MODE (METRIC TONS/YEAR) /uni00A0(1)\n\n|                                     |      | Total        | Recycled     | Energy recovery   | Incinerated without energy recovery   | Other elimination channels   |\n|-------------------------------------|------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Hazardous waste                     | 2020 | 48,235  (\u221a)  | 18,177       | 14,790            | 6,854                                 | 8,413                        |\n|                                     | 2019 | 61,558       | 22,768       | 18,794            | 8,513                                 | 11,483                       |\n|                                     | 2018 | 67,265       | 22,569       | 24,047            | 7,174                                 | 13,474                       |\n| Non-hazardous industrial waste  (2) | 2020 | 132,192  (\u221a) | 108,955      | 14,525            | 525                                   | 8,186                        |\n|                                     | 2019 | 182,364      | 146,290      | 18,752            | 625                                   | 16,697                       |\n|                                     | 2018 | 192,720      | 151,513      | 13,372            | 452                                   | 22,383                       |\n| Metallic waste                      | 2020 | 498,243  (\u221a) | 497,420      | -                 | 2                                     | 821                          |\n|                                     | 2019 | 679,814      | 678,475      | -                 | 3                                     | 1,336                        |\n|                                     | 2018 | 720,465      | 717,759      | -                 | 1                                     | 2,706                        |\n| Total                               | 2020 | 678,669  (\u221a) | 624,552  (\u221a) | 29,315            | 7,382                                 | 17,420                       |\n|                                     | 2019 | 923,735      | 847,533      | 37,546            | 9,141                                 | 29,515                       |\n|                                     | 2018 | 980,449      | 891,841      | 42,420            | 7,626                                 | 38,562                       |\n\n- Scope:  all  manufacturing  sites  and  the  main  tertiary,  logistics  and  engineering  sites  of  Groupe  Renault,  excluding  AVTOVAZ  and  excluding  establishments  in  the  RRG (1) Commercial Network (scope of reporting described in section 2.6.1.2).

Indra has been active in automotive dismantling for over 30 years, and is involved in all levels of automobile dismantling, through four complementary activity clusters:\n\n- engineering:  Indra  designs,  develops,  produces  and  markets P innovative tools, equipment and processes (refined and tested at their own dismantling site in Romorantin) that deal with pollution removal,  dismantling  and  recycling  of  ELVs.  These  tools  and methods  are  intended  to  be  widely  distributed  to  all  of  Indra's dismantling network through training programs that the Company develops and provides (291 people were trained in 2020);\n- management-distribution  of  end-of-life  vehicles  for  carmakers, P insurers,  governments,  and  even  individuals  through  its  366 authorized ELV centers;\n- dismantling/recycling in its own dismantling centers; P\n- marketing  of  refurbished  parts  under  warranty:  through  its P network, Indra distributes certified, reusable parts dismantled at its sites.\n\nAccording  to  data  available  at  the  date  of  publication,  more  than 500,000  end-of-life  vehicles  were  processed  in  2019  by  Indra's network of authorized dismantlers or by its own dismantling sites, of which  more  than  25,000  via  the  goodbye-car.com  website,  which, since 2014, has offered a 'turnkey' ELV collection service aimed at retail customers.\n\nThe  Ga\u00efa  subsidiary  collects  unused  parts  in  the  sales  network  as well  as  at  the  plants  and  suppliers'  sorts  them  and,  depending  on their condition, resells them or sends them to the most appropriate recycling system.\n\nRenault  has  invested  in  these  activities  in  order  to  meet  a three-pronged goal:\n\n- to  meet  Renault's  regulatory  requirements  concerning  ELV P collection and processing in France;\n- to  improve  the  technical  and  economic  performance  of  the P network, thereby achieving the European goal of a cost-efficient 95% vehicle recycling and recovery rate, through the development of new dismantling tools and processes for ELVs, and supporting and training its automotive dismantling network;\n- to  feed  recycling  closed  loops  (see  'Recycling'  section  below)  in P order  to  reduce  dependence  on  and  consumption  of  virgin  raw materials.\n\n## Re-use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\nIn addition to the marketing of unused parts by its Ga\u00efa subsidiary (see above), since 2012, the Renault sales network in  France has offered used body parts (including hoods, wings, headlamp units, etc .) collec ted and selected from Indra's network of dismantlers.\n\nTo  facilitate access  to  refurbished parts,  Indra  has  also  developed  the\n\nPRECIS system, in partnership with Sidexa. This was put into service in France in April 2014, and enables a pooled inventory of premium quality refurbished parts for repairers to be created, fed by the Indra network ELV centers. When pricing the repairs to be carried out on vehicles, repairers are automatically informed by the PRECIS module of  Sidexa's  Pacte  Office  software  (market  leader  in  calculation software)  of  the  existence  of  refurbished  parts  available  in  the pooled inventory, thus reducing the repair cost while retaining the same  level  of  guarantees.  This  offer,  unique  amongst  European carmakers, allows the repair of vehicles for which repair would not otherwise have been economically viable using new parts alone, thus extending  the  vehicle  life  while  very  significantly  reducing  the environmental footprint associated with the repairs.\n\nRevenue generated through the PRECIS system amounted to \u20ac5.9 million  in  2020,  up  around  7%  compared  to  2019,  despite  the penalizing  impact  of  the  health  crisis  on  this  activity  (lockdown). Nevertheless, there is significant potential for growth in this activity, linked on the one hand to the still low penetration of used parts in the repair market and on the other, to the law on energy transition for green growth, adopted in France in August 2015, which requires repairers to offer repairs with used parts since January 2017.\n\n## Re-manufacturing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor  more  than  70  years,  Renault  has practiced re-manufacturing i.e. , the refurbishment  of  mechanical  parts. Used  parts  are  collected  in  the  sales network, sorted and refurbished. Since 1949,  the  renovation  of  engines  and manual gearboxes has been carried out at  the  Choisy-le-Roi  (France)  plant. This activity adheres to a strict industrial  process:  involving  complete\n\ndismantling,  cleaning,  sorting,  refurbishment  and  replacement  of faulty or worn parts, re-assembly and inspection.\n\nThese renovated ('RENAULT STANDARD EXCHANGE') parts are sold to  Renault and Dacia vehicle owners at a price that is, on average, 40% lower than that of a new part, while satisfying the same quality requirements. Far from being marginal, the standard exchange parts offering covers nearly 70% of the Group's powertrain parts and up to 50% of ground contact parts and is regularly extended to cover new parts categories.\n\nI\n\n02",

The challenge  is  to  maintain  the  technical qualities and economic value of materials during recycling.\n\nAt end-2019, the closed-loop networks set up by Renault included:\n\n- the recycling of metal parts from vehicle maintenance and repair. P These  flows,  set  up  in  2012,  consisted  of  faulty  engines  and gearboxes sent for renovation: once processed, components that are not reused in the refurbished parts are recycled in Renault's foundries;\n- copper  recycling.  The  wire  bought  back  from  the  dismantlers  of P end-of-life  vehicles  by  Ga\u00efa  is  processed  to  recover  the  copper. The  copper  is  then  re-sold  either  to  the  Fonderie  de  Bretagne (Groupe  Renault)  for  the  production  of  pearlitic  cast  iron  or  to auto  industry  suppliers  for  aluminum  processing.  The  copper recycled  by  Ga\u00efa  is  of  a  high-quality,  enabling  it  to  meet demanding  technical  specifications  and  to  replace  virgin  or post-industrial material;\n- recycling of polypropylene  (plastic  material). Ga\u00efa collects P bumpers from dismantlers and garages and ensures that they are processed in order to meet the Renault-Nissan Alliance's technical specifications.

Loops  between  Renault  plants  or between Renault plants and suppliers of metal parts have been set up in France, Spain, and Brazil;\n- recycling of platinum-group  metals.  Ga\u00efa  collects  catalytic P converters from end-of-life vehicles from dismantlers, from which it  extracts the platinum-group metals. These recycled metals are then  sold  to  an  auto  industry  supplier  to  be  re-used  in  the manufacturing of catalytic converters;\n- recycling  of  textile  fibers  from  seat  belt  and  fabric  production P offcuts to produce interior vehicle trims (see example of New ZOE at the end of this section).\n\nThese  closed  loops  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  Renault's objectives  for  the  use  of  recycled  materials  in  new  vehicles.  The collection  and  transportation  of  materials  during  the  recycling process are also optimized to achieve the greatest reduction in the environmental footprint of the recycled materials.\n\nThe  Group  regularly  develops  new  ways  of  reusing  materials  from end-of-life vehicles, notably through collaborative research projects bringing  together  manufacturers,  local  authorities,  ADEME  and universities (see boxed section). Accordingly, the development of an acoustic  insulating  material  for  soundproofing  vehicles  using recycled  automotive  textiles  and  professional  clothing  in  an exclusive process received the technical validation of the Engineering department, with a view to developing applications on the range's vehicles.\n\nend-of-life vehicles or other end-of-life products  in the manufacturing of new vehicles:\n\n## I - TREFIV (Thermoplastic Glass Fiber Recycling) Project\n\nThis collaborative project aims to produce structural parts from post-consumer polypropylene through the addition of fiberglass. It  is  conducted  in  partnership  with  other  companies  including SYNOVA, an SME specializing in the recycling of plastics that was already  involved  in  the  ICARRE95  project.  Approval  for  its application  to  structural  parts  on  ESPACE  V  ('functional  front end') was approved in 2017, and implemented in 2018.\n\n## II - TREVIS (Visible Thermoplastic Recycling) Project\n\nThe purpose of this project is to pave the way for the integration of recycled plastics in visible parts, which represent most of the mass of plastic materials used in new vehicles. Recycled plastics are widely used today in non-visible parts, but their integration into  visible  parts  requires  a  perceived  quality  and  durability equivalent to those of the best new plastics, especially in terms of  color,  smell  and  colorfastness  in  climatic  conditions  such  as prolonged exposure to the sun.",

This project enables new materials combining technical performance,  cost  savings  and  ease  of  production,  in  close cooperation  with  ADIENT  SA  (subsidiary  of  Johnson  Controls), automotive  textile  producer  and  Filatures  du  Parc.  It  combines two  recycled  materials  from  end-of-life  vehicles,  automotive manufacturing  scraps  and  PET  (polyethylene  terephthalate) bottles, to develop a textile that can be used in the manufacture of  thermoformed  automotive  parts.  Apart  from  its  obvious environmental  interest,  this  solution  also  has  the  potential  for significant gains in terms of simplification of industrial processes,\n\nNew ZOE, presented in 2019, shows how the research projects lead to  applications  in  mass  production.  Renault  and  its  partners  have succeeded in applying the historical carding process to an innovative fabric  made  from  recycled  materials  from  the  automotive industry . Designed  according  to  circular  economy  principles,  it comprises  on  average  50%  textile  and  seat  belt  scraps,  and  50% recycled  fibers  from  plastic  bottles.  The  short  loop  organization (manufacturing + procurement) reduces CO2 emissions by more than\n\n60% compared to  the  fabric  of  the  previous  ZOE  from  a  standard manufacturing  process.  While  recycled  synthetic  materials  are generally  reserved  for  casings  and  other  protection  components  in cars,  New  ZOE  uses  them  for  the  first  time  in  the  composition  of cabin  components:  fabric  for  the  ZEN  finish  and  also  exposed injection molded plastic trim parts.

This  deterioration  in  production  conditions  leads  to  a  2020  result above  the  target,  at  a  level  similar  to  2019.  The  actions to  reduce VOC emissions in the Group's plants during 2020 included:\n\n- the continued installation of new VOC incineration equipment on P the  Pitesti,  Valladolid,  Palencia  and  Douai  sites,  in  accordance with  the  roadmap  laid  out  to  anticipate  changes  in  regulatory thresholds;\n- installation of robotic equipment for certain bodywork paint and P coating  tasks,  which  enables  much  finer  optimization  of  the quantities of products used;\n- the  continuation  of  the  deployment  of  a  sealant  with  very  low P solvent  content  for  applications  within  the  vehicle  passenger compartment and of the deployment of a new 'Alliance' sealant with less solvent for exteriors;\n- perpetuation of actions undertaken to improve the recovery rate P of used solvents at all sites (cleaning and purging solvents).\n\nAt  end-2020,  more  than  80%  of  vehicles  produced  were  painted using paint with a water-soluble base (i.e., the solvent in the paint is comprised mainly of water).\n\n## VOC EMISSIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope: all body assembly and mixed Groupe Renault manufacturing sites (reporting scope described in section 2.6.1.2).

The NOx trap is a chemical system which traps nitrogen oxides and then converts them into neutral gases. It has been fitted to  all  diesel  passenger  cars  sold  by  the  Group  in  Europe  since September 2015.  SCR  (Selective  Catalytic  Reduction)  technology works  to  convert  nitrogen  oxides  into  water  and  nitrogen  by injecting  urea.  It  is  fitted  on  all  TRAFIC  and  MASTER  light commercial vehicles sold in Europe since September 2015.\n\nHowever,  the  identification  of  significant  differences  between emissions measured in real use and in the laboratory or approval led the  European  Commission  to  define  a  real-use  test  protocol, introduced with the Euro 6d standard (RDE, Real Driving Emissions protocol). Without waiting for these new standards, Groupe Renault had, starting in July 2015, studied the implementation of improvements  on  all  of  its  Euro  6b  and  Euro  6c  diesel  production aiming to further limit emissions in customer  use.  These improvements were gradually rolled out from August 2016:\n\n## Extending the operating range for EGR  (Exhaust Gas 1) Recirculation)  systems,  a  key  component  in  reducing  nitrogen oxides\n\nStudies and checks undertaken since July 2015 have allowed Groupe Renault to at least double the operating temperature range for full effectiveness  of  its  EGR  systems,  without  any  change  to  the reliability and operating safety of the engine and the vehicle under all customer use conditions.\n\n## Improving the performance of NOx trap management which, in 2) addition  to  the  EGR,  allows  the  storage  and  treatment  of nitrogen oxides at regular intervals\n\nThe frequency and effectiveness of purges are increased with a more 'robust' system, to better take into account the diversity of driving conditions.\n\nDepending  on  the  applications  and  driving  type,  these  combined actions led, on average, to a substantial two to four times reduction of nitrogen oxides across the EGR extension zone. All customers who purchased  a  Euro  6b  vehicle  - compliant  with  the  applicable standards -  before  these  improvement  measures  can  benefit  from\n\n## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\nthem via an engine calibration adjustment carried out free of charge by the after-sales network.\n\nIn total, at the end of 2020, combining vehicles directly output from the factory with these improvements and vehicles processed in the after-sales  network,  89%  of  Groupe  Renault  Euro  6b  or  Euro  6c diesel fleet in circulation have  already  benefited  from  the improvement measures decided by Renault.\n\nThe  roll-out  of  Euro  6d  standards  is  now  an  important  area  of progress  in  the  reduction  of  pollutant  emissions  from  internal combustion  engine  vehicles.  These  standards  have  introduced measurements under real and variable driving conditions (RDE, Real Driving  Emissions  protocol)  of  the  emissions  of  pollutants  such  as nitrogen oxides or particles, in addition to the measurements made in the laboratory based on the standardized test cycle. The latter, by nature, cannot cover the very wide variety of customer usage: driving and weather conditions, driving style, vehicle load\u2026\n\nThis is why Renault, for several years, has supported the European approach aimed at implementing measurements under real driving conditions  (RDE  protocol)  in  addition  to  implementing  the  new WLTP  laboratory  test  procedure,  more  representative  of  average customer use and the diversity of vehicle equipment than the NEDC cycle.\n\nThe adaptation of Groupe Renault vehicles to these new standards required  an  ambitious  program  of  investments  of  more  than \u20ac2 billion.\n\nThe first phase, Euro 6d temp, has been  applicable since September 2017 for new models (new types) and since September 2019  for  all  new  vehicles  (all  types).  The  European Commission  simultaneously  introduced  the  new  laboratory  test procedure, WLTP, which has been applicable since September 2017 for new models and from September 2018 for all new vehicles.\n\nIn  order  to  meet  Euro 6d  temp  standards,  SCR  technology,  which Renault  has  used  on  its  TRAFIC  and  MASTER  light  commercial vehicles  since  the  Euro  6b  standards,  started  to  be  rolled  out  on diesel passenger cars in Europe in 2018 and has been fitted to the entire range of diesel passenger cars in Europe since September 2019. The SCR will also be used to meet the coming Euro 6d standards, with more stringent limits: this regulation is applicable to individual cars from January 2020 for new types, January 2021 for all  types and to light commercial vehicles depending on their mass from January 2021 for new types and January 2022 for all types. This SCR  technology,  which  is  more  constraining  in  use,  with  the installation  on  the  vehicle  of  a  urea  tank  that  needs  to  be  refilled regularly,  can  nevertheless  reduce  nitrogen  oxides  with  increased effectiveness  over  an  extended  engine  operating  range.  For  most applications, SCR and NOx trap technologies will be combined.\n\nIn  other  markets,  Renault  adapts  the  technical  definitions  of  its powertrains to fit local specifics (fuel quality, climate, dust, etc. )  in such a way as to ensure each vehicle's compliance with applicable regulations  in  the  country  in  which  it  is  sold.  In  addition  to  strict regulatory  compliance,  the  Group  capitalizes  on  lessons  learned  in Europe to fulfill the growing expectations throughout the world, that pollutant  emissions  during  customer  use  are  better  taken  into account and controlled (see above).\n\nI\n\n02",

Once they reach  a  significant  proportion  of  all vehicles on the road, they will contribute  to  improving  air  quality  in urban  areas  because  they  do  not generate  emissions  during  use.   In 2012  Renault (1) teamed  up  with  the city authorities in Rome and with Aria\n\nTechnologies  and  Arianet,  two  companies  specialized  in  modeling atmospheric  pollution,  to  quantify  the  health  benefits  of  electric vehicles  in  urban  areas.  Nissan,  along  with  Aria  Technologies,  also led a similar study in the city of Hong Kong in 2014. These studies, which assessed both the reduction in local emissions due to electric vehicles  and  the  increase  in  emissions  caused  by  the  increase  in electricity  generation,  modeled  the  impact  of  a  proactive  policy  to promote electric mobility.\n\nI\n\nIn the scenario tested in Rome, electric vehicles represented 20% of all vehicles in city center areas subject to existing traffic restrictions, reflecting political proactiveness to promote  clean vehicles (replacing the public fleet with electric vehicles and promoting small electric  LCVs  for  goods  delivery  to  end-customers).  The  study's findings showed a clear health benefit from the proactive scenario compared with the base scenario. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) would be reduced by 9% to 25% depending on the season, and up to 45% on major arterial roads, and particle concentrations (PM10) would be reduced by up to 30%. Finally, the number of inhabitants and  visitors  alike  exposed  to  benzene  concentrations  higher  than 2\u03bcg/m 3 (maximum value recommended by France's High Council for Public Health) in the historic city center would be reduced by nearly 50% in relation to the base scenario.\n\nThe proactive scenario modeled in Hong Kong assumed that 20% of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (including light buses) would be electric and 20% of taxis and light buses would be bi-fuel LPG  vehicles,  all  within  a  downtown  area  of  1km 2 (Mong  Kok neighborhood). This modeling demonstrates that if 20% of vehicles were  electric,  this  fact  alone  would  generate  a  46%  reduction  in winter  concentrations  of  volatile  organic  compounds  and  a  25%",

At the end of 2020, nearly 10,000 Groupe Renault electric vehicles were thus available in car-sharing  services  in  Europe.  For  more  details,  see  section 2.3.1 'Imagining  and  designing  tomorrow's  sustainable  mobility,'  in particular 2.3.1.2.B 'Accelerating the development of new forms of mobility and entering into strategic partnerships.'\n\n## CABIN AIR QUALITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir  in  the  cabin  is  a  complex  blend  of air  drawn  from  outside  the  vehicle, which  supplies  the  heating  and  air conditioning  systems,  and  emissions from materials within the cabin. Groupe Renault takes these two components  into  consideration  when designing  its  vehicles  in  order  to control  their  impact  on  the  quality  of cabin  air,  and  to  maintain  the  health\n\nand comfort of passengers.\n\n## TREATMENT OF EXTERNAL AIR DRAWN INTO THE CABIN\n\nWhen driving, the main influence on the quality of cabin air is that of external air,  given  the  fast  air  renewal  flow  required  for  passenger comfort  (200m 3 /h  on  average).  Therefore,  as  soon  as  it  designs  its vehicles,  Renault  ensures  that  the  architecture  enables  an  air treatment system to be fitted. Three types of technical solutions are implemented:\n\n- the  cabin  particle  filter  (also  known  as  a  pollen  filter):  made  of 1) non-woven fibers, it is designed to trap the smallest particles, with an  effectiveness  of  over  85%  efficiency  from  2.5\u03bcm  in  diameter and 95% for particles above 10\u03bcm;\n- combination cabin filters:  these  are  pollen  filters  with  a  layer  of 2) activated  charcoal  grains  added.  In  addition  to  particles,  the activated charcoal traps gases, including aromatic compounds and nitrogen dioxide. These filters are sized to trap an average of more than 85% of these compounds on the Renault vehicles on which they are fitted;\n- automatic  air  inlet  management  system:  this  is  an  electronic 3) system linked to a toxicity sensor, which automatically closes the air inlet when the sensor identifies a peak concentration of certain pollutants  in  the  outside  air  (such  as  when  the  vehicle  passes through  a  tunnel).  In  particular,  it  detects  gases  emitted  by preceding vehicles.\n\nThe  technical  solutions  applied  to  each  vehicle  are  the  result  of  a compromise  between  a  number  of  requirements  (treatment efficiency,  defogging,  noise  and  energy  consumption),  and  vary according  to  range  and  equipment  level.  All  passenger  cars\n\n## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\nworldwide  sold  under  the  Renault,  Dacia,  Alpine  and  Renault Samsung Motors brands are fitted with a cabin particulate filter as standard. Most of the latest passenger car models marketed under the  Renault  brand  in  Europe  come  with  combination  filters  as standard  on  all  versions,  together  with  the  automatic  air  inlet management system on higher trim levels fitted with automatic air conditioning  (the  system  cannot  be  offered  on  other  versions  as  it requires power-driven air inlet valves).\n\nHowever, any Renault, Dacia or Renault Samsung Motors customer whose  vehicle  is  not  initially  fitted  with  a  technical  air  treatment solution from the outset and requiring such a solution will be able to obtain  this  equipment  through  additional  Renault  after-sales service.\n\n## EMISSIONS FROM MATERIALS WITHIN THE CABIN\n\nWhen the vehicle is stationary and exposed to sunlight, the presence of volatile chemical substance emissions from materials in the cabin may become overbearing when compared to the quality of the air outside.  Renault  has  therefore  set  itself  the  objective  of  managing these  emissions  in  order  to  minimize  their  impact  on  passenger health and comfort.\n\nThus, since 2009, all materials within all internal vehicle parts (cabin and trunk) whose total weight within the vehicle is over 100g have been subject to specifications deployed to all relevant suppliers, in an  effort  to  manage  emissions  levels  from  the  main  categories  of volatile  organic  compounds.  Based  on  these  requirements,  in  2017 the  Alliance  harmonized  its  processes  by  developing  shared standards for Renault and Nissan.\n\nRenault also ensures that any odors caused by the main contributors to the vehicle's atmosphere are limited. This is assessed by a panel of  experts  who  are  specifically  trained  in  Renault's  own  methods, based on olfactory descriptors and an understanding of odor levels as  set  out  by  the  methods  of  IAP-Sentic \u00ae , a  consultancy  firm specializing in odors (and a subsidiary of the Burgeap group).\n\n## Substance risk management b)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo  safeguard  the  health  of  workers and consumers, and to protect ecosystems,  legislators  have  imposed restrictions  on  the  use  of  hazardous substances  in  the  workplace  and  in products.  In  the  European  Union,  the introduction of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation in 2007 heightened\n\nawareness  of  chemical  risks  and  prompted  an  increase  in  the number  of  restrictions  and  usage  precautions.  Many  countries around the world have subsequently followed the European Union with similar regulations, and are also in the process of legislating on other aspects related to heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and biocides, for instance.\n\nI\n\n02",

The  three divisions devoted to this activity support the roll-out of initiatives in the company's day-to-day processes:\n\n- in collaboration with the departments responsible for P occupational  health  and  working  conditions,  the  Industrial Hygiene and Chemical Risks division manages workers' exposure to  chemical  risks  at  all  Renault  production,  engineering  and logistics sites around the world. It monitors the chemicals present in the  formulations  delivered  to  Renault  and  verifies  the classification  and  labeling  of  the  chemical  products  used  on  site and also ensures compliance with the Product Safety Data Sheets provided  by  suppliers.  In  addition,  the  division  coordinates research  into  technical  solutions  to  eliminate  priority  \"at-risk\" substances. It provides an initial assessment of the chemical risk in  accordance  with  generic  use  conditions.  Finally,  it  carries  out monitoring  work  on  chemicals  within  the  environment  through the  collection  of  samples  and  the  analysis  of  the  pollutants present  at  workstations.  This  expert  division  was  created  in  the 1960s;\n- the Materials Engineering division monitors substances contained P in  vehicles based on information declared by suppliers using the IMDS (International Material Data System) system, shared with 35 international carmakers. It steers the processes and developments of  tools  enabling  the  company  to  meet  the  information  and transparency  obligations  required  by  regulations  (in  particular REACH).  It  steers  the  search  for  alternative  technical  solutions enabling the elimination of priority risk substances by relying on relays  within  each  branch  of  engineering  (vehicle,  mechanics, after-sales),  and  reinforces  this  approach  with  its  counterparts both  within  and  outside  the  Alliance.  It  defines  and  steers compliance actions in the concerned entities, anticipates default risks upstream of the supply chains and designs ways to transform regulatory constraints into economic and competitive opportunities;\n- the  after-sales  Regulatory  Compliance  division  checks  with P suppliers  that  parts,  accessories  and  other  products  sold  by after-sales  teams  comply  with  applicable  regulations  and  make any substitutions, if required.\n\nRegulations  on  substances  are  incorporated  in  the  Company's day-to-day  operations.  A  multidisciplinary  team  is  in  charge  of driving  the  appropriate  processes  and  information  systems,  which enable  the  Company  to  fulfill  the  information  and  transparency obligations  required  by  regulations  (notably  REACH).  This  team  is supported  by  contacts  within  each  engineering  branch  (vehicle, mechanics, after-sales, etc. ) and is confirmed by discussions with its counterparts within and outside of the Alliance. It defines and steers compliance  actions  in  the  concerned  entities,  anticipates  default risks upstream of the supply chains and designs ways to transform regulatory constraints into economic and competitive opportunities.\n\nAs part of a preventive and pre-emptive approach, since the 1960s, Renault has been replacing toxic substances found in the chemicals used at its plants and, since the early 2000s, those found in materials used.  Renault  has  drawn  up  two  lists  of  substances  prioritized  for replacement,  for  chemicals  and  materials  respectively,  which comprise, in particular, CMR  (carcinogenic, mutagenic and\n\nreprotoxic) substances, substances of very high concern and subject to  prior  authorization  (Appendix  XIV  of  the  REACH  regulations),  as well as substances whose use is not yet restricted, but which Renault would like to see banned at a global level.\n\nThese two lists are respectively described in two separate standards: the Groupe Renault 'Substances' 00-10-050 standard for industrial chemicals,  and  RNES  0027,  jointly  used  by  Renault  and  Nissan  for automotive  components.  These  standards  prohibit  the  use  of hazardous substances and substances of concern, list substances for which substitution is a priority, and require suppliers to declare the substances used in their parts and preparations. In calls for tenders, Renault  explicitly  asks  suppliers  to  comply  with  these  standards. Their application is enforced by each of the competent divisions.\n\nIn line with regulations, Renault adheres to a policy of transparency towards its professional and private customers.\n\nIn  addition  to  standard  substances  and  those  with  identified  risks, Renault  pays  close  attention  to  the  potential  health  effects  of innovative materials, such as nanomaterials.\n\n## Noise c)\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNoise is a complex subject that involves  a  wide  range  of  factors  such as type and power of noise sources by octave band, directivity,  the  impact  of buildings, topography  of  locations, weather\u2026 For the comfort of residents living  near  its  production  facilities, Renault  is  making  active  efforts  to limit  and  reduce  noise  pollution  from its  activities  by  working  to  control\n\nnoise at both existing and new facilities. The Group aims to do this both by selecting high-performance materials with this goal in mind, and by implementing soundproofing measures. These measures are focused on all types of extraction chimneys, boilers, metal drops and logistics-related  activities,  which  generally  constitute  the  main sources of external noise across our industrial sites.\n\n## Vehicle use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll ICE vehicles marketed by Renault in Europe  in  2019  generate  a  maximum external noise of 74 dBA  during driving,    in  accordance (1) with  the regulations applicable to vehicles certified prior to July 2016. The majority also comply with the new 72 dBA limit imposed by European regulation  540/2014/EC,  even  though this limit only applies to models\n\ncertified  since  July  2016.  However,  the  Group  is  already  preparing phases  2  and  3  of  the  implementation  of  this  regulation,  which reduce the level of external noise authorized for most passenger cars to 70 dBA in 2022 (2020 for new types) and 68 dBA in 2026 (2024 for new  types)  by  working  to  improve  engine  sound  insulation  and install  additional  absorbers  in  the  wheel  arches  (to  absorb  rolling noise) and underbody fairings.\n\n- With the exception of the Master van which, due to its payload and power, is classified under a different category than the rest of the range, (1) subject to specific exterior noise limits.\n\nI",

For  this reason,  the  Group  has  set  a  goal  of minimizing  the  impact  of  its  activities on  this  precious  resource  through  the implementation  of  the  following  five objectives:\n\nreduce water consumption at source P as  well  as  the  quantities  of  wastewater  through  well-designed processes  and  optimized  management.  For  example,  vehicle surface  treatment  is  one  of  the  major  causes  of  water consumption in an automotive plant. The cascade filling of baths (water  from  one  bath  is  redirected  to  another  that  requires  a lower level of purity, etc. ), stopping the rinse water flow between each  body,  and  the  presence  of  rinse  manifolds  between  stages (which prevents the contamination of baths with impurities from the body) enable a reduction at source of the quantities of water used as well as the waste to be treated;\n\n- reuse water where possible for the same use: cooling in a closed P circuit, increasing the lifespan of baths, etc. ;\n- recycle water  for  other  compatible  uses,  with  or  without P additional  treatment.  For  example,  the  Sofasa  plant  (Colombia) recycles saline concentrates from reverse osmosis (purified) water to  the  flushing  of  toilets  and  the  water  curtains  (air  cleaners)  of paint pits, which facilitates the reduction of the quantity of water consumed as well as that of waste discharged;\n- minimize  the  impact of  residual  waste  on  the  environment P through efficient and strictly controlled treatment processes;\n- control  the  risk of  accidental  pollution  of  surface  water  by P installing  the  means  needed  to  confine  water  from  accidental spillages  and  that  used  for  firefighting.  Since  late  2015,  the Tangiers plant, designed not to discharge any industrial waste, has accordingly had a basin that enables it to confine any accidental pollution  and  avoid  its  discharge  into  the  environment,  and  to purify rainwater drained on the site by decantation.\n\n## Reducing industrial effluents\n\nAmong  measures  used  to  meet  its  objectives  of  reducing  water abstraction  and  the  discharge  of  pollutants  into  the  environment, Renault  places  a  particularly  strong  emphasis  on  the  recycling  of industrial effluents: the wastewater generated by the manufacturing process  is  treated  in  a  manner  that  allows  this  same  water  to  be transformed into a resource of sufficient quality to be re-used in the same process.\n\n- In the  powertrain plants,  the  recycling  of  industrial  effluents consists in separating the distillate (treated water) that can then be reintroduced  into  the  process,  from  the  concentrate  (oily  residue from  evaporation)  that  will  be  directed  to  the  appropriate  waste treatment channel.\n- In the  body  assembly plants,  the  recycling  technology  is  more complex  because  the  water  used  in  the  manufacturing  process (surface treatment and electrocoating) must be of very high quality. The  treated  waste  is  subjected  to  a  reverse  osmosis  process  (a purification process using a membrane), then an evapo-concentration  process  (extreme  concentration  of  waste through different evaporation stages), that enables the re-use of the majority  of  the  water  contained  therein,  in  a  purified  form,  within the  industrial  processes  and  minimizes  the  quantities  of  waste generated.\n\nI\n\nAt the international level, the standards applicable to external noise of  vehicles  are  most  often  inspired  by  European  standards  and adopted a few years later. The vehicles marketed by Groupe Renault outside  Europe,  which  have  noise  levels  comparable  to  their European  versions,  therefore  often  anticipate  locally  applicable noise standards by several years.",

Following  the  additional  investments made in 2015 to increase the volume of industrial effluents recycled and thus keep pace with the increase in the site's production rate, the volume of water saved amounted to nearly 280,000m 3 per year on average. The Tangiers site is the plant with the lowest external water  abstraction  ratio  (at  1.4m 3 per  vehicle produced  in  2020)  in accordance with the target assigned when it was founded.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF WATER SUPPLIES BY SOURCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope: all manufacturing plants and the main Groupe Renault tertiary, logistics and engineering sites, excluding AVTOVAZ and excluding the RRG Commercial Network (reporting scope described in appendix 2.6.1.2).\n\n## Soil and water tables /uni00A0EFPD8a/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD11d/uni00A0 E.\n\n## TOTAL SURFACE AREA FOR SITES AND IMPERVIOUS AREAS\n\n|                                                     | 2020   | 2019   | Change over 1 year   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------------|\n| Total surface area  (in ha)                         | 3,895  | 3,926  | -0.8%                |\n| Impervious areas  (in ha)                           | 1,904  | 1,904  | 0%                   |\n| Impervious areas  (as a% of the total surface area) | 48.9%  | 48,5%  | +0.8%                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSoil and water tables are environments that  can  potentially  allow  pollution from  past  activities  to  come  into contact  with  targets  to  be  protected (humans,  natural  environments, etc. ). Renau lt  h as  therefore  implemented  a policy  to  prevent  pollution  of  these environments and, when past pollution is suspected, implements specific management strategies.  This  policy  is\n\napplied  to  all  Group  facilities  presenting  a  potential  pollution  risk, i.e., operat iona l industrial  facilities,  former  industrial  facilities\n\nI\n\nreconverted to other uses, as well as the Renault Retail Group (RRG) commercial  network.  Renault  aims  to  maintain  in-house  skills  in prevention of soil pollution and remediation.\n\nIn  2020,  the  manufacturing  sites,  as  well  as  the  main  engineering, logistics  and  head  office  sites  of  Groupe  Renault  (consolidated environmental scope), represented a total area of 3,895 hectares, of which  48.9%  are  impervious  areas  such  as  buildings,  parking  lots, roads,  and  paths.  Total  surface  area  and  the  proportion  of impervious surfaces did not change significantly from the previous year, at constant scope.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the indicator of water consumption per vehicle produced, firstly because of the sharp drop in volumes that it has caused (the \"heel\" effect manifested by water  consumption  that  is  not  strictly  proportional  to  production volumes), and secondly because of unplanned shutdowns linked to certain  periods  of  confinement,  which  took  place  in  non-optimal conditions  and  therefore  generated  overconsumption  (emptying  of process baths that could not be kept stopped, cleaning/disinfection operations linked to prolonged stoppages of certain equipment such as  air-cooling  towers  or  hot  water  circuits).

A risk-rating  grid  is  used  to  assess  the level of pollution prevention and reinforce  it  if  necessary  by  prioritizing required  rehabilitation  work.  In  the case  of  new  production  facilities,  the soil  prevention  guide  describes  the best  techniques to implement in each type of facility. Both of these tools are\n\nin use across all Renault industrial sites worldwide. The prevention policy ultimately relies on monitoring of the quality of groundwater. This monitoring, which is carried out systematically when regulations so require (all industrial sites in France), is also carried out  voluntarily  by  Renault  when  potential  sources  of  pollution  are identified, to spot any movement of pollutants to sensitive areas and to take appropriate measures as early as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince  2011,  all  sites  in  the  RRG commercial network have been equipped  with  pollution  prevention tools,  and  oil  and  fuel  are  now  stored above  ground  or  in  double-wall  tanks fitted with alarms and retention tanks. Priority  preventative  actions,  such  as neutralization or replacement of single-wall  underground  tanks  with aboveground  or  double-wall  storage\n\ntanks, were completed in the European RRG network in 2013.\n\n## Remediation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe management  of  past  subsoil pollution  hinges  on  a  risk  assessment based on the source-vector-target concept  and  aims  to  ensure  the suitability of the subsoil for the planned  or  identified  uses.  There  are several stages to the pollution management system:\n\n- historic and  documentary  study, P including  an  analysis  of  the  site's\n\nvulnerability, has been carried out for operational industrial sites, former  industrial  sites  converted  to  other  uses  and  the  RRG commercial  network.  It  is  updated  as  necessary.  This  study enables the identification of potential sources of pollution and the evaluation  of  the  vulnerability  level  at  the  facility  and  in  its immediate surroundings;\n\n- a  physical diagnostic of soils is carried out on-site depending on P the results of historic and documentary research;\n- if  the  diagnostic  confirms  the  presence  of  pollution  sources,  a P quantitative evaluation of the health risks is performed in order to assess  the  exposure  risk  for  site  users  and  the  immediate surroundings (workers, residents, school children, etc. );\n\n## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT\n\n- remediation operations may be started depending on the results P of  the  two  preceding  steps.  These  operations  are  carried  out  by specialized service providers with recognized expertise, under the supervision of the Renault soil specialist.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProtecting  the  biodiversity  of  species and ecosystems requires specific measures  such  as  protecting  habitats and combating the overexploitation of species,  as  well  as  reducing  polluting emissions  into  ecosystems  (water,  air and  soil).  Renault's  continuous  efforts to  mitigate  the  environmental  impact of its activities and  products  (see previous  sections)  help  to  combat\n\necosystem depletion in this way.\n\nRenault  also  takes  special  measures  to  protect  biodiversity. Industrial projects involving the construction or extension of plants are  assessed  to  measure  their  impact  on  surrounding  ecosystems. On the Tangiers site inaugurated in 2012, a study was carried out on the impact of the planting of more than 5,000 trees between 2014 and 2015 in order to prevent soil erosion related to rainwater run-off on pervious areas of the site and the associated negative impacts on biodiversity.  In  Brazil,  Renault,  with  the  agreement  of  the  local authorities,  established  a  plan  in  2008  to  protect  and  manage biodiversity  on  part  of  the  land  acquired  for  its  industrial  site  in Curitiba. Out of a total area of 2.5 million m 2 , 60% is devoted to the conservation of an area of virgin forest. This virgin forest, made up mainly  of  araucaria  trees,  a  species  of  pine  threatened  with extinction and protected under Brazilian law, is home to more than 170 species of animal.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  itself  the  target  of  having  20  biodiversity pre-assessments  carried  out  on  its  industrial  sites  by  2023.  These analyzes will be entrusted to specialized consulting firms.\n\nIn  2018,  Groupe  Renault  joined  the  Act4Nature  initiative  and subscribed  to  the  10  collective  commitments  proposed.  This initiative, launched by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE) aims to protect, value and restore biodiversity.\n\nLastly,  in  2019,  Groupe  Renault  became  a  member  of  the  Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), an organization in which members aim to improve the environmental and socio-economic  performance  of  the  natural  rubber  sector,  which notably includes actions to fight against deforestation.\n\nI\n\nRRG uses the same assessment method to clean contaminated soils on former oil and fuel storage sites, even when this contamination is due to the former  owner.  Between  2003  and end-2020, remediation work was undertaken at 29 sites.\n\n## Biodiversity /uni00A0EFPD13/uni00A0 F.\n\n02",

Renault's  contribution  to  the  Institute's activities  consisted  of  around  \u20ac11.5 million  in  funding  and  the permanent  secondment  of  four  to  six  experts.  VeDeCom  will continue  to  play  a  major  role  in  the  French  sustainable  mobility research ecosystem, and Renault will maintain its annual investment of some \u20ac1.7 million.\n\n## Through innovative solutions /uni00A0EFPD14a/uni00A0 2.3.1.2\n\nGroupe  Renault  has  been  committed  to  the  development  of large-scale  electric  mobility  for  more  than  10  years.  A  pioneer  in Europe, in 2009 it announced the launch of a complete range of four affordable 100% electric vehicles before 2012, and kept its promise. Since  then,  it  has  renewed  its  offering  to  provide  even  greater performance,  adding  new  electric  models  and  expanding  it  with electrified models, both hybrid and plug-in hybrids. By 2022, all new models will have an electric or electrified version.\n\nGroupe  Renault's  objective  is  simple:  to  make  electric  mobility accessible to all, by meeting everyone's needs.\n\nIn parallel with the development of electric vehicles for individuals, professionals  and  fleets,  we  are  also  working  with  the  regions  to build  mobility  solutions  adapted  to  the  needs  of  our  various customers.\n\n## Groupe Renault, pioneer in electric vehicles A.\n\nElectric  mobility  is  the  best  immediately  available  response  to accelerate  the  energy  transition,  fight  against  climate  change  and improve air quality in cities.\n\nGroupe Renault has been marketing a range of electric vehicles since late 2012. This has given the Group a valuable lead over new market entrants, particularly in terms of sales and after-sales issues.\n\n## Today,  nearly  one  in  five  electric  vehicles  sold  in  Europe  is  a Renault.\n\nIn 2020, in the European electric vehicle market, the Renault brand doubled its sales and confirmed its leadership, with 115,888 electric vehicles sold. The ZOE is the best-selling electric car, with growth of 114% to 100,657 units.\n\nIn addition to its European range, the Group also markets the RSM SM3 Z.E. sedan sold in Korea and the Renault City K-ZE city car in China.\n\nI\n\nIn 2020, the Group launched an electric version of the TWINGO city car,  and  presented  the  Dacia  SPRING,  the  first  Dacia-branded electric vehicle, which will be marketed from 2021. The Group also presented  its  vision  of  tomorrow's  electric  mobility  through  the MEGANE eVision show car, a prelude to the Group's future compact EV.\n\nThe  MEGANE  eVision  is  designed  on  the  basis  of  the  Alliance CMF-EV  platform.  Natively  and  exclusively  designed  for  100% electric vehicles, this new platform pushes the limits of modularity. It  will  allow  the  launch  of  several  vehicles  with  different  uses  and sizes,  thanks  in  particular  to  the  ability  to  install  batteries  of different  sizes  and  heights.  Taking  full  advantage  of  the  specific features  of  the  electric  powertrain,  this  platform  will  also  provide each of its models with interior space worthy of a higher segment.\n\nThe production version of the MEGANE eVision will be presented in 2021.\n\nSince 2020, Groupe Renault has had a complementary offering with hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions on its best-selling CLIO, CAPTUR and MEGANE models. The all-new Renault ARKANA hybrid was also presented, with its European launch scheduled for 2021 onwards.\n\nFor Groupe Renault, its electric vision goes well beyond the car. Thus, the Group is investing in the development of ecosystems that promote  energy  transition  and  improve  electric  mobility.  With  the Advanced  Battery  Storage projects  in  France  and  Germany,  and SmartHubs in the United Kingdom, it is initiating two major projects in Europe that use second-life battery technologies, with the aim of managing the gap between electricity consumption and production in  order  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energies  in  the  energy mix.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  formed  a  partnership  with  Compagnie  Seine Alliance and the integrator GreenVision to electrify a fleet of boats on the Seine using second-life batteries of Renault electric vehicles.\n\nFinally, in the Madeira Archipelago, Groupe Renault has joined forces with  EEM (Empresa de Electricidade da Madeira) and The Mobility House to ensure that 99% of the energy on the island of Porto Santo is  renewable  by  2030.  The  project  consists  of  two-way  electric vehicles (V2G) that can interact with the electric grid according to its needs, a fleet of electric vehicles (Renault ZOE and KANGOO Z.E.), as well as second-life batteries for stationary energy storage.\n\n## Accelerating the development of new forms of B. mobility and entering into strategic partnerships\n\nIn late 2019, Groupe Renault set up a department dedicated to new forms of  mobility,  along  with  a  new  investment  structure,  Renault M.A.I (Mobility as an Industry). This is the result of a learning process ('test & learn'), that began four years earlier with the development of  new  mobility  services  such  as  the  car-sharing  services  Renault Mobility in France or Zity, and by carrying out targeted acquisitions and  investments  in  a  variety  of  start-ups  specializing  in  mobility services (Karhoo, iCabbi).\n\nIn  September  2020,  the  Group  announced  a  project  to  develop  its organization around four Business Units, including one dedicated to new  mobility.  This  project  aims  to  create  a  simpler  and  more results-oriented organization, while strengthening the cohesion and sense of belonging of the teams thus brought together.",

        "page_content": "The department's ambition is to bring the various players together around these issues, through ambitious, strategic partnerships. It is positioning itself as the favored partner for cities, local authorities, regulating authorities and transport operators. The aim: to promote mobility  for  consumers  and  meet  regional  environmental,  social and economic challenges.\n\nGroupe Renault's ambition is to invent new forms of mobility and new  ecosystems,  not  only  in  urban  areas,  but  throughout  the regions,  to  benefit  suburban  areas  and  to  promote  improved access  to  rural  areas  in  France  and  worldwide. This  approach  is part  of  Groupe  Renault's  industrial  culture,  which  has  always endeavored to innovate and be one step ahead. It also involves the development  of  new  occupations  and  the  entry  into  unexplored, sustainable market segments.\n\nAccording  to  the  UN,  in  2050,  the  global  population  will  reach 9.8 billion people, with almost 70% living in urban areas compared to 55%  today,  representing  2.5 billion  additional  city  dwellers.  This forecast gives an indication of the immense challenges to be faced in terms  of  quality  of  life,  inclusion,  urbanization,  housing,  transport and healthcare in cities, as well as accessibility to these new forms of mobility outside of cities.\n\nIn terms of mobility, new uses and new technologies are spreading, questioning the place and status of individual  cars  ownership.  The market  is  increasingly  being  structured  according  to  uses  of consumers, who are looking less for ownership of a vehicle, than for a multimodal, innovative, connected, more ecological offering suited to the diversity of their needs.\n\nThe  city  of  the  future  will  be  smarter,  more  inclusive,  more connected  and  more  collaborative. Vehicles  that  are  clean,  silent and  shared  will  travel  through  it.  Personal  vehicles  will  share  the road in the cities, as well as in rural areas, with new forms of services based  on  usage:  car-sharing,  carpooling,  on-demand  vehicles (chauffeur driven vehicles, taxis, etc. ) as well as robot vehicles.\n\nAs a sustainable mobility operator, and no longer just a carmaker, Groupe  Renault  is  working  to  develop  a  vast  range  of  shared  and environmentally-responsible solutions: car-sharing, on-demand transport, short-term rentals, and carpooling.\n\nToday  in  Europe,  several  car-sharing  services  operated  by  the Group's partners use Renault electric vehicles, and Groupe Renault is  the  leader  in  electric  car-sharing  in  Europe .  As  such,  nearly 10,000 electric vehicles are available to users of car-sharing services in most European capitals. The Group adapts its offer to the context of each city, offering both free-floating and closed-loop solutions.\n\nAmong  the  different  types  of  car-sharing,  the  trend  is  towards free-floating which  enables  the  user  to  park  the  vehicle  wherever he/she wants to, within a defined region. This is one of the options chosen by Groupe Renault. Thus, the Group operates a car-sharing service  under  the Zity brand,  through  its  joint  venture  with  the Spanish  group  Ferrovial,  with  a  fleet  of  725  ZOE  in  Madrid  since 2017, and 500 ZOE in Paris since May 2020. The Zity service operates with a very strict health protocol, reassuring for customers looking for a personal mode of transport during the COVID-19 health crisis.\n\nThe Group has also developed a short-term rental service Renault Mobility -  which enables Group vehicles to be rented. The Renault Mobility offering uses the Renault network.\n\nIn  France,  Renault  Mobility  offers  vehicle  rentals  directly  at dealerships  and  also  has  2,000  cars  accessible  24  hours  a  day through a mobile application.\n\nFurthermore,  Renault  Mobility  also  enables  companies  to  develop employee car-sharing to optimize the utilization rate of their fleets. The Group has also forged partnerships with brands such as Ikea and Leroy Merlin in order to offer the service to their customers. Today, Renault  Mobility  is  also  available  in  Italy  for  the  Renault  network replacement vehicle program, and the roll-out is underway on other European markets.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  also  offers  a  white-label  car-sharing  service, marketed under the Glide brand.\n\nThe car is already electric and connected: tomorrow it could also be autonomous, with the benefits  of  smoother,  more  fluid  traffic  and improved safety. The development of autonomous cars and shuttles will  accelerate  the  growth  of  electric,  autonomous  and  shared mobility  services.  They  will  promote  complementarity  between modes  of  transport,  multimodality  and  make  the  overall  system cleaner, safer, more accessible, more effective and more efficient.\n\nFrom  2017  to  2020,  Groupe  Renault,  together  with  public  and private  partners,  has  tested  electric,  autonomous  and  shared mobility  services  delivered  by  autonomous  Renault  ZOE  Cab prototypes:\n\n- TORNADO project in Rambouillet : testing of autonomous driving P solutions, technologies and infrastructures in sparsely populated areas.  Testing  took  place  along  a  13  km  route  illustrating  the scenario of a direct link between Gazeran station and the Bel Air business park in Rambouillet, representative of the specificities of suburban and rural areas;\n- Rouen Normandy Autonomous Lab :  first testing in Europe of an P autonomous,  shared  and  on-demand  mobility  service  on  open roads, as an extension to the existing public transport service. The tests were carried out on three routes serving different stopping points throughout  the  district  known  as  'Technop\u00f4le  du Madrillet';\n- Paris-Saclay  Autonomous  Lab : testing  of  services  for  more P intelligent, electric, autonomous, shared and on-demand mobility, in addition to the modes of transport present in the Paris-Saclay area.  The  aim  was  to  test  a  point-to-point  mobility  service  for everyday travel on the Paris-Saclay urban campus.\n\nGroupe Renault is continuing its research into autonomous mobility and  is  participating,  via  the SAM  (Safety  and  Acceptability  of Driving and Autonomous Mobility) consortium coordinated by the PFA - the French automotive platform - in the EVRA (Autonomous Road  Vehicle  Testing)  project launched  by  ADEME  (French Environment  and  Energy  Management  Agency)  as  part  of  the Investing in the Future Program (PIA), which is at the heart of the national  strategy  for  the  development  of  autonomous  vehicles.  Its objective is to contribute to the development of security validation methodologies,  to  improve  knowledge  on  uses,  acceptability  and societal impacts. Groupe Renault's work will consist in particular of testing  on-demand,  electric,  autonomous  and  shared  car  services, such  as  collective  public  transport  and  private  public  transport,  in Rouen city center and at Paris-Saclay.\n\n02",

This agreement brings together the strengths of the three partners and  extends  their  expertise  through  the  assessment  of  market opportunities and joint research on commercial, legal and regulatory issues related to mobility service offers in France and Japan.\n\nSince  2017,  Groupe  Renault  has  also  offered  a  range  of  products designed  for  professional  customers  as  part  of on-demand transport:\n\n- Karhoo brings  together  licensed  taxi  and  chauffeur-driven  car P fleets from around the world with transport and tourism operators to create global mobility solutions. Its Mobility Exchange platform offers  simple  integration  options  (API,  SDK  and  white-label microsites) allowing partners to quickly offer taxi ordering in their web and mobile applications;\n- the  Group  continues  to  support  the  development  of iCabbi ,  a P publisher of taxi fleet management systems, which is now one of the  world's  largest  dispatch  providers  (leading  positions  in  the United States, Canada, Ireland and in the corporate segment (>500 cars) in the United Kingdom (No. 2), with notably the acquisition of  Original  Software  (Brazil)  and  Mobile  Knowledge  (Canada). iCabbi's customers made 130 million trips over the last 12 months using the iCabbi system, used by over 80,000 taxis/chauffeur-driven cars;\n- in  France,  in  addition  to  its  internal  carpooling  platform  for P employees,  Groupe  Renault  has  joined  forces  with Klaxit ,  the leading carpooling app for commuters. Since 2014, Technocentre employees have been able to share their journeys directly using the app. This makes it easy for them to find new carpoolers and save  money  on  their  daily  commute.  More  generally,  Renault  is working  to  improve  the  carpooling  experience  by  studying interface  solutions  between  carpooling  operators,  its  connected vehicles and digital tools;\n- in  addition,  through  its  MOBILIZE  Invest  investment  company, P Renault supports ECOV, which works alongside local authorities to build spontaneous, dynamic carpooling lines that are accessible to all in suburban and rural areas;\n- lastly, Alliance Ventures , Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi  Motors P Corporation's  investment  fund  created  in  January 2018,  has  also invested in Transit, a multi-modal application (MaaS) that enables users to choose the most appropriate mobility mode for a trip, and Coord, which facilitates the analysis, sharing and collection of data on 'curbs,' in order to offer partners and cities solutions to better manage the different mobility services.\n\nI\n\n## Thinking about mobility challenges C. in/uni00A0sustainable cities\n\nThe city of tomorrow will be innovative and adaptable while being respectful of the environment. The growth of the urban population comes  with  countless  challenges:  developing  urban  mobility  while limiting  pollution,  providing  solutions  to  climate  change  and  for society's ecological transition, optimizing water and energy management, improving the quality of life of people, contributing to social  cohesion,  designing,  building  and  renovating  buildings  and neighborhoods.\n\nGroupe  Renault  contributes  to  collective  thinking  on  sustainable mobility systems in cities, and particularly on mobility ecosystems.\n\nIt is a partner of the LaVilleE+ led by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to support the creation  of  tomorrow's  towns  and  cities  and  make  them  human, inclusive and sustainable. LaVilleE+ is focusing on three differentiating  aspects  comprising  impact,  interaction  through  play and  holisstic  approach  in  with  big  public  and  private  contractors currently shaping territorial development. Innovation stems from a holistic  approach  to  city  development  acting  systematically  on  the four  pillars  comprising  it  (citizenship,  mobility,  resources  and property),  thanks  to  the  multi-skilled  nature  of  an  ecosystem  of partners.\n\nINCIT-EV  is  a  European  test  project for  innovative  charging solutions  for  electric  vehicles.  Its  objective  is  to  encourage  the development  of  electric  mobility  by  starting  from  understanding user expectations and developing appropriate charging technologies from there. The project, which runs from January 2020 to December 2023  (48  months),  is  divided  into  two  phases:  a  study  and preparation  phase,  then  a  so-called  'demonstration'  phase  where seven technologies will be tested under real conditions, starting in the  second  half  of  2022.  Initiated  and  coordinated  by  Groupe Renault,  the  project,  supported  and  financed  by  the  European Union's  Horizon  2020  research  and  innovation  program,  brings together  33  players  and  partners  from  a  wide  range  of  voluntarily diverse  backgrounds  (manufacturers,  universities,  institutes,  cities, start-ups, SMEs), all experts in their field.\n\nGroupe Renault also sponsors a number of academic chairs that feed this  thinking,  such  as  the  Urban  Logistics  Chair  with  Mines ParisTech,  which  since  2016  has  been  focused  on  inventing innovative and sustainable urban logistics models.\n\nRenault  freely  shares  its  expertise  in  this  area  via  numerous thematic round-tables and seminars.",

        "page_content": "## Commitment to road safety 2.3.2\n\nRoad  safety  is  a  real  public  health  issue  throughout  the  world.  All continents are affected. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some 1.35 million people are killed on the world's roads each year  and  50 million  injured.  Unless  concerted  and  effective  action  is taken,  the  WHO  predicts  that  road  accidents  will  remain  one  of  the 10 largest causes of death between now and 2030. Groupe Renault, a carmaker that designs, manufactures and distributes cars throughout the world, makes road safety one of the core concepts of its CSR.\n\nThe  Group's  international  expansion  must  be  accompanied  by  the design of vehicles meeting regulations and security requirements in its  new markets. The causes of accidents and injuries in these new Regions  differ  from  the  European  market,  so  Groupe  Renault  is expanding its accident research beyond Europe, transferring its own know-how  and  gaining  expertise  from  local  laboratories  and universities, and other key players in road safety.\n\nIn  order  to  fully  assume  its  responsibilities,  Groupe  Renault  has made a two-fold commitment:\n\n- through  its  products:  based  on  an  analysis  of  observed  risks,  it P incorporates  solutions  and  innovations  into  all  its  design,\n\nOUR SOCIETAL COMMITMENT\n\nmanufacturing  and  marketing  processes  in  order  to  protect vehicle occupants and others exposed to road risks (pedestrians, cyclists, etc. );\n\n- within society: it participates actively with governments and civil P society  throughout  the  world  to  help  improve  road  safety.  Both alone  and  in  collaboration  with  other  organizations,  Groupe Renault  works  to  raise  awareness  of  road  safety  and  facilitate transfer of skills among road users and road safety stakeholders.\n\n## Groupe Renault's road safety policy 2.3.2.1 /uni00A0EFPD16a/uni00A0\n\nGroupe Renault's  systemic  vision  integrates  the  specific  nature  of each  country,  in  order  to  take  into  account  elements  other  than vehicles  and  vehicle  technologies.  These  elements  include  in particular road infrastructure, current legislation and its application, policies,  and  road  user  training  and  awareness  levels.  Accordingly, alone  or  in  partnerships,  Groupe  Renault  works  to  implement  the measures best suited to a country's level of maturity.\n\n## Groupe Renault's road safety policy and actions are based on a five-pronged approach:\n\nRAISE AWARENESS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPREVENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCORRECT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPROTECT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRESCUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RAISE AWARENESS\n\nChanging the behavior of all stakeholders (public authorities, parents, drivers, children) over the long-term and educating people from the earliest age to the dangers of the road, are key weapons in the battle to improve road safety.\n\n## PREVENT\n\nPrevention involves helping drivers to anticipate risks. Part of the solution consists of helping the driver by assisting with the driving task (driving aids). The remainder lies in encouraging more responsible driving. Drivers need to understand the limits beyond which they will be incapable of controlling their vehicles, and the situations in which they are putting themselves at risk.\n\n## CORRECT\n\nThe quality of road handling and braking constitutes the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle. They are fundamental to avoiding accidents. Nevertheless, there are situations where technology should intervene to compensate for driver error. This is the purpose of these active safety systems. They intervene in difficult or emergency conditions; however, they do not do entirely replace the driver.\n\n## PROTECT\n\nA top priority of Groupe Renault's road safety strategy is to protect the car's occupants according to the nature and severity of the impact, regardless of their age, size or location in the vehicle, in small and large cars alike. Renault exceeds Euro NCAP standards by also equipping the rear seats of its vehicles with systems to provide optimal passenger protection. The protection of other road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc .) is also taken into account.\n\n## RESCUE\n\nGroupe Renault collaborates with French and foreign emergency services to optimize help for accident casualties. These services receive guides explaining how to perform rescue operations on Renault vehicles. They are also provided with late-model vehicles on which they can practice victim extraction methods. Innovative modifications are applied to the brand's vehicles to ensure that emergency firefighter interventions are safer and more effective.\n\nI\n\n02",

Currently  running  in  around 10 countries, it is the biggest road safety awareness campaign in the world ever organized by a carmaker. It also includes issues such as environmental  protection  and  eco-mobility.  Teaching  kits  are available in paper format as well as applications for telephones and digital  tablets,  a  \"serious  game\"  for  PC/MAC,  and  the  first  virtual reality format is also available.\n\nThe 'serious game' offers three missions and numerous scenarios to raise  the  awareness  of  children  between  the  ages  of  seven  and eleven on road safety and sustainable mobility. Download links can be  accessed  free-of-charge  from  the  program's  teaching  resource (www.securite-mobilite-pour-tous.com/).  The  international  'Your Ideas,  Your  Initiatives'  competition  enables  middle-school  children to take an active role in their own safety and mobility. Despite the extremely restrictive health context, the 2019-2020  edition highlighted 55 very concrete initiatives, implemented by more than 1,500 students in 16 countries.\n\n## Your Ideas, Your Initiatives: an educational program on road safety and sustainable mobility for teenagers\n\nLaunched in 2011, the core of the project is an international competition  promoted  in  schools  on  four  continents.  578 projects were conducted in nine editions, by more than 14,000 students in 34 countries in Africa, America, Asia and Europe.\n\nThe  approach,  based  on  participation  and  empowerment,  is structured  in  two  stages:  research  and  identification  of  a problem  in  the  community  (Your  Ideas),  development  of  a campaign  to  solve  it  and  evaluation  of  its  impact  (Your Initiatives).\n\nThe  2019-2020  edition  awarded  prizes  to  three  schools,  in Spain,  Morocco  and  Russia.  Their  respective  projects  dealt with the devastating  effects of drinking and  driving, promoting  responsible  driving  to  motorized  two-wheelers, and  transforming  a  park  into  a  safe  leisure  area  for  local people.\n\nThe Your Ideas, Your Initiatives program received the Prince Michael International Road Safety Award in December 2019.\n\nI\n\n## Global Road Safety Partnership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2020,  Groupe  Renault  continued  to  support  the initiatives  run  by  GRSP,  an  NGO  hosted  by  the International  Federation  of  Red  Cross  and  Red Crescent Societies. This organization brings together government  agencies,  the  private  sector  and  civil society to help emerging countries develop their own road  safety  capabilities,  implement  best  practices,\n\nand  set  up  the  multi-sector  partnerships  needed  to  effectively develop road safety (see www.grsproadsafety.org).\n\nIn 2020, the GRSP worked in over 40 countries worldwide, through extensive national voluntary networks.\n\n## Master in road safety management (Manser)\n\nTo help road safety actors develop their own know-how, using global best  practices  and  taking  regional  characteristics  into  account, Groupe Renault has co-developed a Master's degree in 'Road safety management' (Manser) for the Middle-East and North Africa, where road risk is particularly acute.\n\nThe  objective  is  to  produce  national  and  regional  managers  and experts capable of creating and coordinating road safety policies in their countries.\n\nSince it was launched in 2012, the program has enabled 88 students (some of whom receive financial aid) to take the 18-month course of theoretical and practical instruction.\n\n## Employee safety\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  particularly  focused  on  road  accident  risk prevention  and  especially  on  employee  training.  Initiatives  are constantly  being  taken  to  inform  and  train  staff,  including communication campaigns, road safety week and defensive driving courses.\n\nThe  prevention  of  employee  accidents  during  commuting  and business travel is part and parcel of the overall road risk prevention effort,  which  was  launched  by  Groupe  Renault  many  years  ago.  In France,  Groupe  Renault  is  a  signatory  of  the  road  safety  Charter (October 11, 2016), thereby confirming the Company's commitment to the fight against poor road safety.\n\nIn this respect, the Company has initiated a series of campaigns for Group  employees  internationally,  throughout  its  engineering, manufacturing and sales operations. Specifically, it has updated and widely  circulated  the  Groupe  Renault  Drivers'  Charter,  which  is focused  on  three  main  areas:  'I  plan  my  journeys,'  'I  adhere scrupulously  to  all  good  driving  rules,'  and  'I  am  a  responsible driver.' Since 2018, this Drivers' Charter has been the foundation for an e-learning module for the Group's employees worldwide. It aims to support and empower employees during their business travel and commuting, and on the job. Initially available in French, English and Spanish, this digital training module has been expanded this year to Brazilian employees. Other languages including Arabic are planned.",

In November 2020, during road safety at work week, awareness-raising initiatives were undertaken in numerous industrial and tertiary sites.\n\n## Prevent-Correct-Protect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPREVENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPROTECT\n\nCORRECT\n\nGroupe  Renault  has  played  an  active  part  in  road  safety  for  more than  50 years,  long  before  it  became  the  familiar  media  topic  we know today.\n\nThis commitment to automotive safety has been substantiated by the  attainment,  23 times  over,  of  the  maximum  5-star  rating  in Euro NCAP tests, having been the first carmaker to do so in 2001 (with the LAGUNA II).\n\nThe  in-depth  knowledge  of  accident  and  injury  mechanisms developed through LAB (the Groupe Renault-PSA Group Accidentology and Biomechanics Laboratory) research, has furnished Groupe Renault with an ambitious and pertinent vision of the steps needed to improve road safety.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  results  of  consumer  tests,  Groupe  Renault investigated  areas  which  it  deemed  crucial  to  reducing  injury  risk during  accidents,  such  as  submarining  and  compatibility.  These issues  of  submarining  and  compatibility  are  taken  into  account  in developments to the Euro NCAP protocol introduced in 2015, then in 2020.\n\nThis effort in the field of passive safety will therefore continue over the coming years, particularly supporting the tightening of rules for consumer testing around the world.\n\nWhile efforts in passive safety undertaken by the entire automotive industry  have  enabled  extremely  significant  improvements  to  be achieved  in  terms  of  reducing  the  road  death  toll,  recent technological advances, complementing public policy, have heralded a  new  and  very  promising  area  of  progress,  meaning  that  it  is  no longer a case of limiting the consequences of an accident, but rather, of reducing their severity, or even, avoiding them altogether.\n\nThis  is  where  primary  road  safety  comes  into  play,  with  ADAS (Advanced  driver  assistance  systems).  These  ADAS  can  alert  the driver  to  danger,  assist  with  corrective  maneuvers  or  brake  when collision is imminent, in the driver's place if he or she has failed to react.  These  systems,  the  most  typical  today  being  Automatic Emergency  Braking  (AEB),  will  be  able  to  deal  with  one  of  the recognized causes of accidents, i.e. ,  driver  error  due  to  inattention. Groupe  Renault  does  not  claim  to  be  a  pioneer  in  this  field  of development, which, due to the cost of these technological systems, mainly  features  in  the  high-end  market.  Nevertheless,  the  Group\n\nOUR SOCIETAL COMMITMENT\n\nwants  to  make  them  accessible  to  a  wider  public  without  any reduction  in  performance,  while  working  to  integrate  them  in  our vehicles. Other ADAS, however, are now well entrenched in Groupe Renault's  lineage  (Groupe  Renault  was  one  of  the  pioneers  of  the speed-limiter  in  Europe).  These  include  the  over-speed  warning, combined  with  the  speed-limiter,  head-up  display  of  driving information, automatic switching of main-beam/dipped-beam headlamps at night, lane departure warning, blind-spot warning and safe distance alert.\n\nIn 2015, the New ESPACE was the first in its range to feature these new  functions,  which  are  already  to  be  found  in  other  C  and D-segment  vehicles,  namely  the  KADJAR,  the  TALISMAN,  the MEGANE  IV  and  the  KOLEOS.  The  preparation  of  new  systems  is underway,  benefiting  from  the  very  rapid  progress  in  the development  of  sensors  and  onboard  electronics.  In  2016,  SCENIC unveiled  a  new  generation  of  even  more  powerful  ADAS  systems, including Automatic Emergency Braking with pedestrian detection. This will feature in the vast majority of our future products, including less-premium ranges over the coming months. This equipment has been  improved  with  the  renewal  of  the  segment  B  CLIO/CAPTUR launched in 2019, which obtained 5 stars in the euroNCAP ratings, with the latest generation ADAS enabling the CLIO to be voted best car in its category.\n\nGroupe Renault makes over 10,000 educational videos (17 languages and 22 countries) presenting the functionalities and technologies of Renault, Dacia and Alpine brand vehicles, including ADAS, available to customers.\n\nThe  website  https://www.e-guide.renault.com/portail/  has  received 3.5  million  visits  since  2017  and  the  tutorials,  available  in  17 languages and 22 countries, have been seen nearly 17 million times.\n\n## Rescue\n\nRESCUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2012,  Groupe  Renault  became  the  official  partner of the French National Federation of Fire and Rescue Services (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale Des Sapeurs-Pompiers de  France  or  FNSPF),  formalizing  a  relationship  that had  already  existed  for  many  years  between  these two major players in sustainable mobility.\n\nIn September 2018, the Renault Foundation renewed its commitment  and  support  to  the  Federation  to  work  together  in general interest missions carried out by the FNSPF and the French Fire  and  Rescue  Services  in  terms  of  vehicle  security,  passenger safety and road safety.\n\nTo  confirm  its  commitment  to  the  emergency  services  and  ensure their  safety  during  their  interventions  on  Renault  and  Dacia  range vehicles,  Renault  has  included,  within  its  CSR  department,  a Lieutenant-Colonel from SDIS 78 (Service D\u00e9partemental d'Incendie et de Secours - Departmental Fire and Rescue Service) for a period of  three  years.  His  role  is  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  the inclusion of the activities of firefighters from the design of vehicles, and  to  apply  the  acquired  know-how  amongst  his  colleagues  in France and abroad.\n\nI\n\n02",

The introduction  was  given  by  the  interministerial  delegate  for  road safety  and  many  technical  discussions  with  the  engineering professions followed. This seminar was followed by a day specially dedicated to foreign firefighters so that they could train on a dozen new-generation vehicles from the range made available to them, on a  SDIS  (French  Departmental  Fire  and  Safety  Service)  site  in Yvelines.  These  extrication  operations  were  made  possible  by  the Groupe  Renault's  constructive  partnership  with  all  suppliers  of extrication equipment.\n\n## Consideration of technological developments and electrical risks\n\nVehicles are equipped with increasingly efficient safety systems, but they  also  pack  in  more  technologies  that  complicate  the  work  of emergency services.\n\nGroupe Renault's commitment to improving road safety can also be seen  in  technical  and  R&D  collaborations,  which  take  into  account these new technological risks and include vehicle extrication and fire extinguishing  tests  on  vehicles  that  use  new  energy  sources.  The Group regularly donates several hundred latest-generation vehicles for training the fire service in highway rescue.\n\nThe implemented strategy focuses on four factors:\n\n- improving firefighters' knowledge of the Group's vehicles; P\n- acknowledgment of constraints experienced by firefighters during P their work by engineers and designers working on new products;\n- implementation of research and innovation projects; P\n- technical modification to vehicles. P\n\nEach  new  vehicle  model  in  the  range  includes  a decision  support form (format  ISO 17840)  designed  for  operational  firefighters,  as well as an ERG (emergency response guide) (format ISO 17840) for alternative energy models.\n\nEmergency  service  needs  are  taken  into  account  from  the  design stage of vehicles. As an example, fireman access is already a feature of the ZOE, ZOE Long Range, KANGOO Z.E. Long Range and MASTER Z.E.  It  will  be  present  on  future  electric  and  hybrid  vehicles  in  the range, such as the electric TWINGO and electric SPRING, when the power  of  the  traction  battery  so  requires.  This  is  the  case  for  the rechargeable hybrid versions of the CAPTUR and MEGANE.\n\nFireman access is a part placed on the electric vehicle chassis. In the event of dangerous fire, it allows firefighters to access the 400 volt battery below with their fire hose. The aim is to drown the battery by filling  it  with  water,  which  is  the  only  way  to  turn  off  a  lithium  ion battery  quickly  and  permanently.  This  allows  firefighters  to extinguish the fire in only a few minutes, as opposed to one hour in its absence. Groupe Renault is currently the only carmaker to offer this  technical  solution  to  firefighters. Each  new  model  equipped with a fireman access undergoes a burn test during its development to  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  this  system.  Thus,  in  2020,  several\n\nI\n\nburn sessions took place with the SDIS 78 firefighters to confirm the proper functioning of the fireman access.\n\nThe traction  battery  disconnection  system (HT)  is  positioned directly  on  the  battery  in  order  to  guarantee  complete  electrical safety for all those involved, including the emergency services.\n\nThe  Rescue  Code provides  firefighters  with  another  tool  enabling them  to  carry  out  extrication  maneuvers  more  quickly  and effectively.  This  is  a  QR code  that  the  customer  can  affix  on  the windshield  or  rear  window.  It  allows  firefighters  to  access  the damaged vehicle's decision support sheet on the rescue site, thanks to  a  free  application  co-developed  by  a  start-up,  the  French  fire department  and  Groupe  Renault.  It  includes  information  for  each model, allowing firefighters to perform their extrication maneuvers safely for themselves and the victims.\n\nOther actions taken in 2020:\n\n- implementation of design studies to ensure the best position for P the service plug and fireman access on future electric and hybrid vehicles in the Renault range;\n- monitoring and ensuring that the Engineering department takes P into  account  the  first  rules  of  design  relating  to  emergency firefighter interventions on our hybrid and electric vehicles;\n- systematic  verification  of  the  appropriate  performance  of  our P electric and hybrid vehicles in the event of fire;\n- participation  in  video  conferences  to  share  our  knowledge  on P alternative energy vehicles with the rescue community;\n- active participation in the Euro NCAP's consideration of firefighter P interventions  following  accidents  in  order  to  define  the  protocol for 2023;\n- donation  of  more  than  600  latest-generation  vehicles  to  the P firefighter  services  of  France  and  Europe  in  2020 to  help improve their road rescue training;\n- publication of three technical articles in firefighter magazines. P\n\n## Integrating new technologies 2.3.2.2\n\nThe vehicle of the future will be zero emission, communicative and driverless. The communicating vehicle will be connected with other vehicles, with the road and with the environment. Vehicles will share information  regarding  their  location,  speed  and  expected  itinerary, etc . They will also act as sensors for other vehicles, indicating traffic, road  issues, etc .  The  information  obtained  will  be  used  first  and foremost  to  provide  safety  services  (incident  warnings  for  onward route,  roads  or  areas  with  specific  hazards, etc. )  as  well  as  traffic services (congestion, alternative real-time itineraries, etc. ).\n\nVehicle  autonomy  is  being  phased  in,  starting  with  partial  or conditional autonomy depending on the driving situations envisaged.\n\nClearly one of the main challenges is to ensure the safety of all users on roads that are increasingly connected and automated. Renault is therefore working in-house with VeDeCom, the scientific community and  industrial  partners,  as  well  as  with  public  authorities,  on  all aspects of safety:",

Plant  competitiveness  and employee  well-being  are  two  major  focuses  of  Industry  4.0  within Groupe Renault.\n\n## Digital transformation 2.3.3.1\n\nThe automotive sector is undergoing rapid change with the ramp-up of  electric  vehicles,  the  arrival  of  the  autonomous  and  connected vehicle, customization, etc .  To meet this revolution, the automotive industry must adapt to ensure the reliability and full traceability of its production.\n\nGroupe  Renault  has  chosen  to  digitalize  its  industrial  system  to support  employees,  manufacture  connected,  customized  vehicles and  reinforce  the  customer's  place  in  the  plant.  Through  this approach, the Company has two aims: guarantee vehicle quality and the competitiveness of its plants.\n\nA  wide  variety  of  digital  and  mobile  tools  are  used  to  simplify  the daily life of employees, enabling them to do their work, learn about the  life  of  the  company  or  carry  out  daily  tasks  under  the  best possible conditions:\n\n- real-time  monitoring  of  plants  and  the  supply  chain  makes  the P production tool even more efficient;\n- technologies  are  used  to  ensure  total  traceability  of  parts  and P significantly accelerate logistics flows;\n- numerous innovations are implemented in production engineering, P from  digital  design  to  prototyping  and  digital  project  reviews,  in order to set up a flexible industrial system with controlled costs.\n\n## Men and women at the heart of 2.3.3.2 Groupe Renault's plants\n\nThe manufacturing teams include over 115,000 employees worldwide. More  agile, more  reactive and  trained in new technologies, employees focus on the highest-value added interventions and take advantage of these innovations to be relieved of certain operations. They exercise fewer arduous tasks, with these gradually being removed.\n\nI",

Groupe  Renault's know-how  in  automotive  manufacturing,  combined  with  Google Cloud's expertise in smart analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence will foster the creation of new industrial solutions.\n\nThe  two  companies  are  also  jointly  setting  up  a  training  program aimed at developing the skills of Groupe Renault employees in the digital environment.\n\n## The Re-Factory in Flins: 2.3.3.3 an/uni00A0industry-leading project\n\nIn November 2020, Groupe Renault announced the transformation of its site in Flins to create the Re-FACTORY, Europe's first circular economy  factory  dedicated  to  mobility,  with  the  target  of  a negative CO2 balance by 2030 (see also section 2.2.3.B \"Resources and the circular economy\").\n\nThis  project,  which  is  part  of  the  Group's  transformation  strategy, will enable Renault to benefit from a rapidly growing source of value while  reaffirming  its  industrial  footprint  in  France.  In  line  with  the Group's  commitments,  the  RE-FACTORY  will  host  the  renovation activities  of  Choisy-le-Roi.  Groupe  Renault  is  planning  support  and training  schemes  for  the  employees  of  Flins  and  Choisy-le-Roi  to develop their skills and aims to employ more than 3,000 people on the site by 2030.\n\n## A global network of CSR correspondents 2.3.4\n\nThe CSR department facilitates, coordinates and relies on a network of  CSR  liaison  officers  in  the  main  departments  and  most  of  the countries in which the Group operates. Each year, it sends a letter containing  CSR  guidelines,  setting  out  the  main  principles  and priorities  of  the  coming  months,  to  all  of  the  Group's  CSR  liaison officers and subsidiary managers. Due to the health crisis, the annual CSR Convention, which usually brings together all CSR correspondents,  could  not  take  place.  By  contrast,  the  DRSE  held nine webinars with all its CSR correspondents from April to June to share experiences and best practices, and also to act in a coordinated manner in this unprecedented context.\n\n## Mobilize Days: an annual event dedicated to CSR in/uni00A0the Group\n\nFor  the  third  consecutive  year,  the  CSR  department  organized Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Week for Groupe Renault as a whole at the beginning of July 2020. The event is called \" Mobilize Days\"  or  \" Mobilize  Week\"  depending  on  the  country.  The  2020 theme  of  these  days  highlighted  employees'  numerous  solidarity commitment, and initiatives taken to fight COVID-19.\n\nI\n\nContrary  to  previous  years,  no  face-to-face  events  could  be organized, so the CSR week was completely digital. E-learning was given priority, with themes such as road safety, gender equality and first  aid.  But  above  all,  the  2020  CSR  week  was  an  opportunity  to highlight employees, individually or in groups formed spontaneously during the crisis, who worked to provide masks, visors, hand sanitizer and  other  equipment  to  local  medical  teams.  All  the  countries  in which  Groupe  Renault  has  commercial  and  industrial  operations actively participated in the solidarity drive (see 2.1.8).\n\n## Calculating the impact of societal initiatives\n\nIn  2020,  the  number  of  CSR  initiatives  recorded  in  the  Group remained  close  to  last  year's  figure  of  355  (compared  with  395  in 2019),  despite  the  health  crisis  and  the  closure  of  Group  sites  for several weeks.\n\nDetails on the reporting scope are provided in section 2.6.3.1.",

Each and every one of them uses their commitment and skills to make mobility sustainable and accessible to all, worldwide, while reflecting society's depth and diversity. Groupe Renault is committed to sustainable and responsible growth, and implements a global, fair and competitive HR policy. HR principles, standards and processes provide a shared frame of reference, which ensures fairness and transparency for all employees. To continue to adapt to transformed roles in the automotive sector and to shape future mobility, the Group has introduced an HR policy with a global vision to ensure that Groupe Renault as a Company is fast-moving, innovative, effective and eager to learn. This policy is based around high-quality social dialog at both local and global levels, and is focused on five priorities:\n\n- be sustainably competitive, while complying with codes of ethics and regulations to maintain employee health and safety; P\n- attract and develop all talent; P\n- implement management approaches that empower their teams; P\n- promote an inclusive culture; P\n- engage our employees and enhance their employee experience. P\n\n## Ensuring the necessary resources and skills 2.4.1.1\n\nAt a time of digital revolution and the emergence of disruptive technologies at an increasing pace, the skills set needed by the company is changing. All levels of qualification are affected by these transformations. Moreover, identification of talent is taking place in an increasingly competitive  market  not  confined  to  the  automotive  sector.  To  anticipate  and  adapt  to  these  rapid  changes,  Groupe  Renault  recruits  new employees with a wide range of profiles and expertise in all the regions where it operates. This means identifying, attracting and fostering the integration and development of talent from increasingly mobile generations.\n\nI",

This ambition is strengthened by our employer  promise,  summarized  by  the  broad  tagline  of  Move  our World Forward.\n\nThe  Group's  appeal  is  based  on  the  ability  to  ensure  sustainable mobility for all within a global, human, creative and historically rich company  strengthened  by  a  strong  alliance  that  is  unique  in  the industry.  Groupe  Renault  offers  a  variety  of  career  paths  in  an environment  of  empowerment  and  inclusion.  In  2020,  the  Group continued  to  invest  in  a  digital  HR  presence  and  social  media profiles, particularly LinkedIn, the world's leading professional social network.  New  employee  videos  promoting  certain  key  professions have been produced and made available, with the aim of boosting its digital presence and providing candidates with a clearer explanation of the career paths available within the Group.\n\nActions  and the working environment are just as crucial as words in ensuring  that  Groupe  Renault  is  a  very  attractive  employer.  All employees  are  therefore  involved  in  the  process.  The  'Employer Strategy'  team  was  created  in  2019  within  the  Group  Human Resources  department  and  works  in  three  areas:  the  employer brand, the employee experience, and inclusion and diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Optimizing the allocation of resources B.\n\n2020  was  marked  by  a  reduction  in  the  Group's  workforce throughout the world.

On July 9, 2019, an additional agreement was signed -'Working together to build a Groupe Renault working environment' (see section 2.4.1.4)\n\nGroupe  Renault's  Diversity  and  Inclusion  strategy  is  managed, implemented  and  monitored  by  the  Diversity  and  Inclusion Committee, chaired at the highest level of the Company, by Senior Management,  with  the  support  of  the  corporate  HR  and  CSR functions, and our stakeholders: managers, social partners, employee volunteers, ethics correspondents, etc.\n\nGuidelines are made available to our countries and local entities so that they can ensure governance and accountability for Diversity and Inclusion at local level.\n\nThe 'Together in Diversity' serious game was launched in 2019, in order  to  increase  awareness  of  diversity  and  inclusion  among employees.  This  Company-wide  training  course  covering  various diversity topics, including disability, intercultural and intergenerational  mix,  gender  diversity,  sexual  orientation  and gender identity,  religion  and  trade  unionism,  was  rolled  out  across the  entire  Group  on  the  LEARNING@ALLIANCE  digital  training platform.  Based  on  actual  case  studies,  this  e-learning  course encourages all employees to join in various role play scenarios that raise  awareness  of  diversity  and  inclusion  in  a  professional environment. The e-learning course is  available  in  French,  English, Spanish, Arabic and Turkish. The scenarios and educational materials are  adapted  to  French  culture  and  regulations.  The  Portuguese version  is  currently  being  rolled  out.  Since  its  launch,  1,260 employees have been made aware of diversity and inclusion through this serious game.\n\nAn internal community, 'MobilizeDiversity', was created in October 2017 to help to change attitudes. It is open to all employees via the Yammer platform, At the end of 2020, it had around 4,800 members, who  discuss  and  share  ideas  and  actions  on  topics  related  to Diversity and Inclusion.\n\nIn  February  2020,  Groupe  Renault  also  organized  a  conference  on 'Diversity  and  Performance',  led  by  Franco-British  expert  Pete Stone.  This  conference  is  available  for  streaming  in  French  with English subtitles for Group employees.\n\nI\n\n## Gender diversity within the Company /uni00A0EFPD6a/uni00A0 b)\n\nFollowing a marked increase until 2017 owing to the proactive policy on diversity in recruitment, as of December 31, 2020, the number of women as a percentage of the Group's total employees had leveled off at 24.7%.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF WOMEN/MEN IN THE WORKFORCE OVER FIVE YEARS /uni00A0EFPD1b/uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF WOMEN/MEN BY REGION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  breakdown  of  women/men  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the global scope as of December 31, 2020.",

        "page_content": "Groupe Renault's ambition is to be the best employer for women in the automotive industry. It has three objectives:\n\n- become a benchmark employer for women; P\n- neutralize the gender pay gap by 2025; P\n- maintain our leadership in gender diversity among carmakers and P increase the presence of women in key positions.\n\nIn  order  to  promote  gender  diversity,  in  2010  Renault  launched WoMen@Renault,  a  comprehensive  plan  for  improving  the representation of women at all levels of the Company. This system is based on two complementary components: a Human Resources plan and an internal social network.\n\nThe first component, Human Resources, involves talent management (recruitment,  training,  career  management).  Groupe Renault's ambition is for women to hold 30% of positions by 2030, 35% by 2035 and 50% by 2050, including:\n\n- the Top governing Bodies; P\n- Senior Management positions (top 4,000); P\n- Management  positions  (top  11,000, i.e. 10%  of  the  Group's P positions  with  the  highest  level  of  responsibility,  excluding  RRG and AVTOVAZ).\n\nIn order to meet these objectives, Renault has chosen to change the indicators used  to  manage  the  detection,  development  and promotion of women.  Through the Diversity & Inclusion scorecard, shared  at  all  levels  of  the  HR  function,  the  Group  monitors  the proportion of women holding these key positions.\n\nThe aim is to ensure that women continue to progress throughout their careers to the highest levels of responsibility.\n\nIn December 2020, 24.3% of the top 11,000 positions and 20.5% of the top 4,000 positions were held by women. In order to ensure, or even  accelerate,  their  ability  to  move  into  these  positions,  all  HR processes  aim  to  ensure  they  are  identified  and  trained.  On  this point, the Group offers women a range of tools to assist with their development  (mentoring,  coaching  and  specific  training  schemes), enabling  them  to  fulfill  their  potential  and  demonstrate  their leadership.\n\nIn addition to the training programs which have already been rolled out  in  recent  years  for  women  during  their  careers,  in  2018  the Group has created a specific training course, in partnership with the London Business School, which helps Renault's female employees to access roles at the highest level of responsibility. Under the Be Your Own Leader program, the female participants are assigned a mentor from the Group's Executive Committee. Thirty women have already benefited from this new program.\n\nIn 2020, two sponsors on gender diversity, members of the Executive Committee, were appointed: V\u00e9ronique Sarlat-Depotte and Denis Le Vot.  They  hosted  an  internal  webinar  on  the  subject  in  September 2020.\n\nThe second component of the WoMen@Renault plan is based on an international  internal  social  network , where  men  and  women discuss  the  progress  of  the  equality  initiative  and  analyze  best practices. Active in 14 countries ,  the  network organizes events and initiatives  to  promote  diversity  both  at  a  central  level  and  in  the various countries, including awareness workshops and conferences.\n\nIn  mid-2020,  Groupe  Renault  joined  the  inter-company  Gender Diversity  in  Seine  network,  in  France.  It  has  committed  to  three initiatives:  an  individual  commitment  by  the  senior  executives  in favor  of  the  association  #JamaisSansElles;  the  organization  of  a round table on the place of women in the media during the health crisis; and a cross-mentoring program.\n\nIn December 2020, Groupe Renault signed the #StOpE Charter (Stop Everyday Sexism in the Workplace).\n\nIn  2020,  Groupe  Renault  continued  its  partnership  with  the Elles Bougent association  in  France.  The  goal  of  these  female  mentors, which include over 100 volunteer Company employees, is to create a dialog with young female students and encourage them to consider scientific and technical careers.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Company  continued  its  commitment  to  UN  Women (France),  a  commitment  first  made  in  2016.  On  International Women's Day on March 8, Groupe Renault continued to support the HeForShe solidarity initiative.\n\nFinally,  Groupe  Renault  participated  in  the  tenth Troph\u00e9es  des Femmes de l'Industrie awards. The event rewards and highlights the exemplary  career  paths  of  women  in  industry.  At  this  event, Delphine  de  Andria,  Program  Director  of  Groupe  Renault's  Africa Middle-East India Pacific Region, received the International Woman of the Year award.\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  November  2020,  the  Group  launched  a  major program to train the entire HR function worldwide in Diversity and Inclusion. Eighty employees have been trained by an external expert to  become  internal  trainers  and  to  run  training  sessions  for  HR employees in 2021.\n\n## Sexual orientation and gender identity c)\n\nIn  2020,  Groupe  Renault  signed  the  United  Nations  Free  &  Equal standards against the discrimination of LGBT+ people and, in France, the Autre Cercle Charter.\n\nIn France, Autre Cercle elected Fran\u00e7ois Roger, Group HR Director, as Role  Model  2020  as  Allied  Manager,  and  Val\u00e9rie  Hallouin,  HR Transformation  Program  Leader,  was  elected  Role  Model  Leader LGBT+.\n\nIn  2012,  the  Group's  employees  created  the  We'R  OutStandInG (LGBT+ and partners) network. The network's initiatives and support for LGBT+ employees helps to create an inclusive work environment in  which  everyone  can  participate  and  flourish,  regardless  of  their sexual orientation or gender identity. The network primarily provides support to people in transition and victims of discrimination, as well as setting up training and conferences.\n\nAn LGBT+ affinity group, Proud@Renault, was launched in Brazil in July 2020.\n\nIn France, LGBT+ representatives have been appointed in all plants.\n\n## Promoting talent at all ages /uni00A0EFPD1c/uni00A0 d)\n\nRecruitment  plans,  which  are  more  limited  than  in  2019,  have nevertheless  made it  possible  to  limit  the  ageing  of  the  workforce and maintain a balanced distribution by age group: 14.1% are less than 30 years old, 30.6% are between 30 and 39 years old, 31.9% are between 40 and 49 years old, 23.4% are more than 50 years old.\n\nI",

The purpose  of  this  is  to  encourage  the  professional  integration  of people with disabilities, to improve the employability of people with disabilities (recruitment and retention), challenge preconceptions of disability,  ensure  greater  accessibility,  adapt  workstations  and provide training, etc.\n\nThe employment rate for people with disabilities was 2.46% in 2020, a slight increase from the rate of 2.33% seen in 2019 at Group level. Since 2020, the Group's ambition is to ask the countries in which it operates, and where there is no legal obligation on this matter, to ensure  that  people  with  disabilities  make  up  at  least  2%  of  its employees.\n\nIn addition, Groupe  Renault  is  organizing  awareness-raising conferences, such as the one on autism in November 2020.\n\nFinally, on November 5, 2020, a dozen Brazilian employees launched the  Access@Renault  affinity  group  to  support  employees  with  a disability and help Renault Brazil go even further in its actions.\n\n## Performance appraisal and competitive B. compensation policy\n\nIn  2012,  Groupe  Renault  rolled  out  a  comprehensive  HR  process management  system  called  Talent@Renault.  In  2019,  the  system was  replaced  by  a  new  tool,  People@Renault,  which  comprises  a number  of  aspects,  including  comprehensive  management  of employee  files, performance  monitoring  and  appraisal, and employee  compensation  (white-collar  only).  Depending  on  the subject  area,  this  tool  is  designed  to  be  used  by  employees, managers and HR staff.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  People@Renault  tool  in  39 Group countries has ensured that the system is fair, more competitive and\n\nI\n\nmore digital, while simplifying it and extending the scope of action for its users.\n\n## Individual performance appraisal a)\n\nThe performance evaluation is based on three principles: team spirit, shared criteria and dialog, using the individual performance review.\n\nThe  job  mastery  is  assessed  according  to  specific  criteria  that  are identical  for  all  employees,  including,  technical  know-how  and  the Renault  Way  principles.  The  assessment  made  by  the  employee's manager is systematically supplemented with a collective evaluation,  to  ensure  greater  consistency  and  fairness  within  the Company.  Furthermore,  the  evaluation  is  based  on  a  discussion between  manager  and  employee  during  the  annual  performance review.  Employees  are  invited  to  make  a  self-evaluation  in preparation  for  this  meeting  to  enhance  the  discussion.  The individual performance is an opportunity to look at the results of the past  year,  to  set  objectives  for  the  year  ahead,  and  to  discuss  the employee's contribution to the Company's performance.\n\nIf results  fall  short  of  expectations,  an  improvement  plan  is implemented by the manager and employee to restore a dynamic to individual performance.\n\nRegular  performance  reviews  throughout  the  year  are  highly recommended in order to ensure continuous professional development.\n\n## Employee development b)\n\nPeople@Renault  provides  a  way  to  share  common  policies  and practices  in  employee  development  (white-collar)  at  Group  level, such as reviewing training requests or defining criteria for selecting high-potential individuals, as well as the systematic implementation of  development  programs  for  those  individuals,  which  include  a career plan. People@Renault is also a tool which enables effective management  of  the  succession  plans  for  key  positions  in  the Company.\n\n## Employee compensation /uni00A0EFPD1g/uni00A0 c)\n\nThe compensation of white-collar staff is based on:\n\n- the  level  of  responsibility . Positions  have  been  assessed P according to their level of responsibility, using to the Korn Ferry international methodology. This assessment makes it possible to draw  up  a  complete  internal  mapping  of  positions  across  the various  business  lines  and  Regions,  thereby  ensuring  greater transparency  and  global  equality  of  career  paths.  Another advantage  is  that  Renault  can  compare  its  pay  scales  with  the market to better manage competitiveness and the attractiveness of the compensation policy. The fixed and variable compensation system is now determined on the basis of this job classification. This  job  assessment  method  has  been  introduced  in  37 Group countries;\n- job  mastery ,  or  the  capacity  to  perform  a  role,  defined  with P precise  and  shared  criteria  to  make  assessment  more  objective and standardized within the Group;\n- the level of achievement of the objectives set, including this year P at least one mandatory objective from among quality, safety and compliance.\n\nAnalysis  of  these  three  components  ensures  that  compensation  is based on the individual's contribution to the company, independent of any other factor.",

The plan consists of seven employee mutual funds (FCPE) invested in accordance with socially responsible investment (SRI) standards and endorsed by the Labor Union Employee Savings Committee (Comit\u00e9 Intersyndical de l'\u00c9pargne Salariale), and two FCPE funds invested in company stock (Renault share, ISIN code FR0000131906). The securities held in the\n\nSRI portfolios are selected on the basis of the issuer's employment policies, working conditions, corporate governance, and compliance with environmental  standards.  Employees  can  make  top-up payments  into  these  seven  savings  funds  and  the  Action  Renault Fund throughout the year.\n\nIn 2020, the total amount of incentives invested in the schemes was \u20ac63.48 million, a decrease of 24.66% since 2019.\n\nIn addition, the total payments in 2020 amounted to \u20ac74.39 million.\n\nOn  July  1,  2020,  Renault  transformed  its  collective  retirement savings scheme (Perco) into a company collective retirement savings scheme (Pereco), enabling employees to build up savings that will be available in the form of annuities or a lump sum when they retire. With  this  system,  employees  can  pay  their  profit-sharing  bonuses, voluntary  payments  (whether  tax  deductible  or  not,  and  with  an additional contribution from Renault) or part of their individual time savings leave (CTI, up to 10 days per year) into the plan. In addition, Renault contributes the equivalent of 30% of the CTI days paid into the plan.\n\nEmployees can choose between free management of their savings, the funds proposed as part of the selected Group savings plan (with the exception of the Company  share  ownership  funds)  or management through the generational funds in the BNP PARIBAS PERSPECTIVES range.\n\nIn  2020,  total  payments  into  Renault's  Group  retirement  savings scheme amounted to \u20ac14.80 million, of which 28.38% came from the cash-out of paid leave.\n\nThe total value of Renault's company savings plans at December 31, 2020 was \u20ac888.41 million (see Appendix 2.6.2).\n\nSince December 2015, BNP PARIBAS E&RE has managed the Company savings plan and Pereco for Renault.\n\n## Control of labor costs f)\n\nThe  Group's  labor  costs  stood  at  \u20ac6,157  million  in  2020,  of  which \u20ac5,453  million  was  for  the  Automotive  division.  They  were  down compared  to  2019,  thanks  to  the  Group's  actions  to  adapt  to  the crisis  in  the  automotive  markets  as  well  as  productivity  and streamlining  efforts.

        "page_content": "OUR SOCIAL COMMITMENT\n\n## Develop the teams to adapt to 2.4.1.3 tomorrow's challenges\n\nTraining  and  skills  management  are  the  essential  drivers  for supporting the Group in achieving its objectives. The Company has two main objectives: on the one hand, to adapt its skills to develop its competitive advantage and still better serve its customers, and on the  other,  to  promote  development  through  training  in  new technologies, notably digital.\n\n## Prospective Skills Management (GPEC) A.\n\nAnticipating  the  impact  of  changes  related  to  our  environment  on our skills is at the core of our concerns. Groupe Renault is leading an initiative,  known  as  Strategic  Skills  Management,  to  identify  new, stable or declining skills, as well as those to be strengthened. Under the coordination of the HR teams, an analysis is produced by experts in  the  various  jobs  from  the  Company's  corporate  functions,  and compared  with  external  benchmarks.  The  priorities  that  emerge constitute working guidelines available to operational staff so that they can integrate these trends to define their areas of criticality and action plans.\n\nIn  a  period  of  turbulence,  this  forward-looking  work,  used  to prioritize  recruitment  and  build  training  plans,  facilitates  the identification of skills to be preserved or transformed.\n\n## In France:\n\nThe transformation of skills initiated several years ago accelerated in 2020 in a context of health and economic crisis.\n\nIn France, a method agreement was signed on July 24, 2020 by the CFDT,  FO  and  CFE/CGC  trade  unions.  This  agreement  defined  the framework,  themes  and  timetable  for  social  dialog  relating  to  the implementation in France of several projects,  including  changes  in employment and technical and tertiary skills.\n\nIn order to deepen the joint reflection on this work, job observatories were  set  up  for  14  corporate  functions:  product  engineering, production  engineering,  logistics,  sales  and  marketing,  information technologies and systems, finance, purchasing, after-sales, product program, quality, communication, design, Human Resources and real estate and facility management. These observatories have enabled in-depth study of the changes forecast in the various jobs, as well as the possible impacts in terms of employment,  skills and qualifications.  The  Strategic  Skills  Management  methodology  has been  reused  and  refined.  In  addition  to  categorization  by  type  of skills,  declining,  stable  or  needing  strengthening, the availability of resources  in  the  labor  market  was  also  considered  (high,  medium, scarce).  Each  job  profile  was  then  positioned  on  this  mapping according to these two axes. This information was fed through each of the local establishments concerned to the employee representative bodies (IRPs), management and employees.\n\nFollowing  this  cycle  of  joint  discussions,  an  agreement  on  the 'Transformation of skills in the corporate functions of Renaults s.a.s.'  was  signed  on  November  20,  2020  by  three  trade\n\nI\n\nunions  (FO,  CFE-CGC  and  CFDT).  This  agreement  covers  the strengthening of technical and tertiary skills as well as arrangements  for  voluntary  redundancies.  Thus,  a  system  of termination of employment by collective agreement, with or without mobility leave, has been set up for a limited scope defined by the job profile mapping. Employees with an eligible job profile, who have a professional project or who are retiring, will be able to benefit from this  scheme  until  September  30,  2021.  In  addition,  a  new  activity exemption plan started on February 1, 2021.\n\nNew training courses will be set up to enable employees to upgrade their  skills  or  change  jobs.  400  employees  will  be  able  to  benefit from  a  professional  retraining  program  in  2021  and  retraining opportunities  will  be  boosted  by  a  new  internal  mobility  scheme. Some 250 strategic recruitments are also planned to strengthen our teams with skills that cannot be developed internally.\n\n## Training to support skills development /uni00A0EFPD5/uni00A0 B.\n\nGroupe Renault supports the skills development of its employees to meet its sustainable growth targets.\n\n2020 will go down as a year upset by a major health crisis that has accelerated  the  development  of  digital  and  distance  learning initiatives. Responsiveness and adaptation are the two key words of the  year,  with  the  switch  in  just  a  few  weeks  from  mostly face-to-face training to training that is essentially distance learning, and employees who have sought to develop their skills by seizing the opportunities offered by the Group in these areas. Thus, the volume of digital training hours was up +191% at 343,847 hours, compared with 180,000 hours at the end of 2019.\n\nBeing a learning organization is not something that can be decreed, but  is  demonstrated  through  many  achievements.  The  creation  in May  2020  of  the  ' Learning  Company '  Yammer  group  showcased best training practices and allowed trainees to express views on the training of actions that contribute most to their training: more than 1,200  Group  employees  are  registered  in  this  community.  Another achievement is the development of the 'Learn' mobile application in  pilot  countries  (Spain,  France,  India,  Morocco),  which  enables employees to take digital training courses on their smartphone.\n\nThe link between the various players in skills development has been strengthened  thanks  to  the  strong  collective  involvement  of  the Learning & Development (L&D) community in the rapid reorganization  of  training  activities,  by  mobilizing  academies  and business Experts, training and  Human  Resources  teams  at headquarters,  and  in  the  Regions  and  countries  where  Groupe Renault operates.\n\nIn April, a global communication campaign was launched to develop e-learning  and  offer  employees  training  courses  that  can  be  taken remotely during periods of lockdown ( e.g. Renault  Way,  ethics  and compliance,  data  protection,  remote  management  &  collaboration, digital  transformation, emotional intelligence, diversity & inclusion, language courses, etc .), relayed by specific campaigns in countries as the pandemic progresses (e.g. 'Learn every Thursday' in Romania).",

        "page_content": "The Group's Learning & Development department has had to adapt the  methods  of  managing  the  L&D  community  composed  of representatives  of  the  15  business  academies,  the  training  and development teams of the Regions and the 15 main countries. For example, the L&D community's annual seminar was a wholly remote event  involving  working  sessions  spread  over  three  days,  with discussions between sessions. The objective of this seminar was to share  feedback  on  the  evolution  of  our  practices  since  September 2019,  but  also  to  create  a  shared  vision  to  develop  a  learning corporate  culture,  allowing  all  Group  employees  to  train  regularly throughout their career at Renault.\n\nTo achieve this objective, which will involve a steady increase in the rate of access to training, the development of a qualitative learning experience is essential. Groupe Renault has therefore continued to develop  its  training  management  system  (LEARNING@ALLIANCE) by making it easier to understand the offer through rapid access to targeted  training  on  important  issues  ( e.g. managing  a  team remotely, improving language skills, etc .) while allowing individualized paths with a choice of training subjects preferred by the  employee  in  question.  The  digital  training  offer  has  also  been strengthened,  with  new  online  training  modules  developed  in particular by the 'Digital Learning Factory'. Access to training from an application available on smartphones has also been activated for Group  employees  located  in  pilot  countries  (France,  Spain,  India, Morocco, etc .)  in  order  to  promote  e-learning,  including  during periods of lockdown.\n\n## The functional academies\n\nThe functional academies continue to revamp their training offering to adapt it to the technical skills requirements of the Group and the health context.\n\nThe Manufacturing Academy ,  which  covers  the  37  Renault  plants, the seven Production Engineering RTx and the 10 Supply Chain DLO, created  seven  training  catalogues  (stamping,  machining,  safety, logistics, etc .)  and 29 training courses (reliability, SSV maintenance, etc .).  To  develop  access  to  the  Manufacturing  training  offer,  new training courses have been designed to be rolled out digitally. This academy  has  also  contributed  to  the  reinforcement  of  strategic Supply Chain skills.\n\nAll  of  the  Academy's  programs  are  offered  in  three  languages (English, Spanish, French), and a network of local relays enables the translation  of  training  content  into  the  Group's  seven  other languages.\n\nThe Engineering Academy has invested in the development of the pedagogical and digital skills of trainers and educational engineers with the opening of a 'Learning Lab' ,  a  place of learning aimed at sharing  best  practices  and  developing  new  uses  in  training  while optimizing the use of the tools made available to the teams.\n\nA learning engineering department is creating new learning spaces such as the 'Learning Engineering Days' (LED) (online conferences of  Group  experts  on  technological  and  digital  transformation  to\n\nmake data central to the businesses), and is extending its  training offer  on  autonomous  vehicles,  electric  and  hybrid  vehicles,  and regulatory  standards  and  requirements.  It  is  also  creating  new training courses directly linked to the Group's strategic levers such as electrification, hybridization, cyber security and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThe Alliance Purchasing Organization Academy has reinforced the Procurement  Academy  program  with  the  creation  of  three tailor-made  e-learning  modules.  Major  marketing  work  has  been carried out to promote this offer online, with a weekly selection of content to follow. By applying neuroscience-based best practices for interaction  and  learning  effectiveness,  there  has  also  been  a particular focus on the quality of learning materials.\n\nThe Quality  and  Customer  Satisfaction  Academy has  organized workshops  in  the Learning  Lab , thereby  continuing  its  digital transformation and supporting the upskilling of its people (trainers, technical  mentors,  the  international  network  of  training  officers). This collaboration  with  the  international  Quality  network  & Customer Satisfaction Academy has contributed to the improvement of collaborative work based on a maturity grid and associated action plans.\n\nThe  Finance  Academy has  accelerated  the  digitization  of  its  offer with the creation of 12 new e-learning modules on the fundamentals of  finance  (accounting,  credit  management,  customs,  transfer pricing, etc .).\n\nThe Digital Academy has rolled out two e-learning training courses (Agile  &  Data),  supplemented  by  six  training  courses  on  Agile, Cybersecurity and Data (created in one month), available to all Group employees.  It  has  also  designed  and  rolled  out  distance  training courses on Agile, Data, Architecture and Office Automation skills (11 synchronous and remote training courses). A committee of experts and specialists from different departments has also been created to oversee  the  development  of  cross-disciplinary  skills  in  Data  and Cybersecurity.\n\nThe Sales, Marketing & Communication Academy has reinforced its blended training courses on digital marketing, customer intelligence and fleet sales, and has contributed to better product knowledge by launching a new learning chain on After-Sales skills, in conjunction with the skills assessment campaign.\n\nFaced with the swiftness and scale of the health crisis, the training and  Human  Resources  teams  very  quickly  mobilized  to  adapt  the training  offer  by  proposing  different  learning  methods  to  their employees (e-learning, video learning, webinars, virtual classrooms, blended  learning, etc .).  By  addressing  a  wide  variety  of  themes (technical  and  cross-disciplinary  skills),  relying  in  particular  on  the digital training offer proposed by the Group in LEARNING@ALLIANCE,  the  commitment  of  the  community  of internal  trainers  and  the  availability  of  business  experts,  the  main objective was to avoid compromising actions already undertaken to develop talent.\n\nI\n\n02",

The L&D team has created a general training program with several components:\n\n- on-boarding, with discussions on business conduct, sustainability, P health, safety and compliance;\n- project management in Agile mode; P\n- quality control methodology; P\n- comprehensive vision of the automotive business; P\n- visits to dealers; P\n- how to drive your own development. P\n\nToday, this program has been adapted and is being rolled out in a fully  remote  format,  supplemented  by  technical  training.  141 participants  have  completed  it,  with  a  total  of  2,534  hours  of training.\n\nIn South Korea, the aim was to encourage employees to engage in their personal development by offering training courses on a variety of  topics  ranging  from  the  humanities  to  economics,  provided  by external  teachers  and  specialists.  Nearly  700  people  have  been trained within this new digital learning framework. Employees were also encouraged to adopt the principles of the Renault Way and its 11 key competencies through the prescription of e-learning modules offered  by  the  country's  L&D  team.  A  challenge  was  launched  to reward the employee who had completed the most hours of online training each month.\n\nSpain prioritized  the  digitization  of  training  content  for  blue-collar workers  with  an  online  documentary  site  containing  digital  books and  training  content.  The  questionnaires  for  the  exams  were prepared  with  the  Forms  app.  To  facilitate  access  to  these  digital training courses, tablets have been purchased and made available to learners.\n\nIndia organized 'moments of engagement', with a series of weekly learning  times  (one  TED  Talk  and  two  e-learning  modules)  on various  themes  such  as  working  from  home,  resilience  and perseverance,  positivity  and  motivation,  mindfulness  and  focus, adapting to change, courage, well-being and compassion, rolled out during the two months of the first period of lockdown. This initiative aimed  to  comfort  and  support  employees  during  the  crisis,  with short  videos  and  online  advice  to  help  them  overcome  feelings  of uncertainty.\n\nTurkey chose to set up a digital platform managed by the training institute so that employees can follow webinars and access articles, online  training,  videos,  remote  activities  for  body  and  mind,  and cultural and artistic activities.\n\nColombia decided  to  take  advantage  of  the  period  of  lockdown  to promote the personal development of its employees with the Elige ser  tu  mejor  version program.  Launched  in  June  2020,  this  skills development  path  is  composed  of  four  e-cards  offering  several online training initiatives twice a week, and was followed by 70% of the people connected.\n\nI\n\nIn France, the pandemic resulted in the postponement of 65% of the training  initiatives  initially  planned  and  the  organization  of  more than 100 distance training courses to replace some of those sessions, some  online  inter-company  training  sessions  having  entered  the framework of the program funded by the FNE.\n\nA number of initiatives were taken within this framework:\n\n- the manufacturing  manager  training program  was  adapted  to P switch  to  blended  mode  incorporating  digital  training  activities, distance coaching and a face-to-face consolidation sequence;\n- language training is provided in fully digital format and has been P accessible  to  all  employees  in  France  since  January  2020,  for  all required  levels.  Access  to  this  platform  has  been  greatly appreciated  by  employees,  particularly  during  the  period  of lockdown from March to July 2020;\n- training of trainers : a complete update of the system was carried P out  with  a  combination  of  virtual  classes,  e-learning,  remote trinomial work and a day in the classroom devoted to role-playing. 100 trainers have been trained on the new system and 39 internal trainers have obtained national certification;\n- the Inclusive  Manager training  course  was  rolled  out  widely  in P 2020 and 2021, following test sessions held at the end of 2019, which were very much appreciated by our managers.\n\nIn Romania ,  in  addition  to  the  promotion  of  the  digital  catalog, strong  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  the  development  of  blended learning through:\n\n- the organization of internal technical training on Teams (25% of P total training hours, with more than 40,000 hours provided);\n- the  development  of  online  training  courses  given  by  internal P trainers on  cross-disciplinary skills (36 sessions  with  447 participants and 1,422 hours provided);\n- online  language  training;  a  total  of  170  talents  and  managers P trained  in  English  and  French,  with  40  hours  of  training  per participant over eight months.\n\n## Strengthening managerial training and mentoring\n\nIn Argentina , the construction of a culture of personal development was  based  for  the  third  consecutive  year  on  development workshops. The activities were designed to help participants identify levers for their personal development by exploring their professional motivation  factors  and  referring  to  the  70-20-10  model,  the  PIE model  (performance,  image,  exposure)  and  work  on  personal branding.  A  total  of  53  participants  received  159  hours  of  training during these workshops.\n\nSouth Korea has rolled out training on 'management essentials' to ensure that middle management grasps success factors (managing change in times of crisis) and the need to integrate and adhere to the  'Renaulution'  priorities.  A  total  of  233  middle  managers participated  in  this  program,  with  the  determination  to  build  a culture of change  in  a  VUCA  (volatile,  uncertain,  complex, ambiguous) environment in seven sessions of seven hours.\n\nRomania has continued its business-to-business mentoring program offered to its talents.",

Nearly 1,800 employees have received training as part of the \u00c9cole des managers .\n\nThe  ramp-up  of  management  training  and  mentorship  was  also  a major axis of the overall training policy, with the Group \"Onboarding management\"  program.  Based  on  the  11  cross-functional  skills associated with the Renault Way, this very successful online training program,  which  has  been  delivered  to  18,000  employees,  was updated in November 2020 with the integration of two new courses on  \"managing  at  a  distance'  and  \"managerial  values\"  (ethics, diversity, inclusion).\n\nIn 2020, the total number of training hours undertaken by people employed by the Group (on a temporary or permanent basis) in 2020 stood at 2,283,403 hours (excluding AVTOVAZ) and 3,126,052 hours (including AVTOVAZ).

Some of the training sessions were organized remotely, also leading to a reduction in the number of  training  hours  to  adapt  the  content  to  this  format.  The  rise  in\n\ndigital  training  was  confirmed  with  the  number  of  hours  of  digital training increasing 1.9-fold between 2019 and 2020 to reach a total of more than 343,847 hours for the Group (180,000 hours in 2019).

P\n\nThese  guidelines,  shared  across  all  jobs  worldwide,  aim  to  identify three levels of potential pools for filling different levels of positions of responsibility, with the objective of promoting equal opportunities and taking diversity into account to prepare the Group's future.\n\nGroupe Renault is thus committed to widening its cultural diversity. To manage this initiative, the HR function has set itself the objective that  30%  of  key  position  holders  should  be  non-French,  compared with 26.5% in 2019.

The individual results produced from the RLA are shared with the employee in question, and used to draw up an  individual  development  plan,  which  might  consist  of  several elements, such as:\n\n- complete training programs like those of Business Schools; P\n- training  programs  that  enhance  specific  skills,  both  in  terms  of P knowledge (finance, international negotiation, etc. )  and  in  terms of soft skills ( e.g. communication);\n- career assessment; P\n- personal coaching, done externally or internally, to prepare for a P new  position  critical  for  Renault  or  to  improve  specific  points (managerial stature, communication, etc. );\n- mentoring  (learning  about  other  company  business  activities, P management through innovation, peer relations, etc. );\n- learning situations, through a change of function or participation P in work groups or cross-functional teams;\n- international assignment. P\n\nThe  RLA  tool  has  been  used  for  more  than  2,892  people  since  its launch in 2012.\n\nThe RLA can also support the recruitment process for experienced managers as well as collective analyses that allow us to adjust our development axes and tools.\n\nN\u00b0 of employees trained",

Concluded  between  the  members  of  the  Group  Works Council  and  IndustriALL  Global  Union,  this  agreement  sets  out  the social,  societal  and  environmental  responsibility  of  the  Group.  The signatories have committed themselves to five major lines of action:\n\n- respect for fundamental social rights; P\n- social responsibility towards employees; P\n- corporate social responsibility in the areas where Groupe Renault P operates;\n- purchasing and relationships with suppliers and subcontractors; P\n- preservation  of  the  planet  through  the  reduction  of  the P environmental footprint.\n\nThe  Group's  second  global  framework  agreement  ' Building  the world of work together within Groupe Renault ' was signed on July 9,  2019  between  Groupe  Renault  Management,  IndustriALL  Global Union, the French trade union federations and the other trade union federations or unions represented on the Group Works Council. This agreement, of which the Group Works Council is a stakeholder, and which  in  October  2019  received  the first  prize  for  the  most innovative  collective  agreement awarded  by  the  Assises  du  Droit Social  (ADS),  aims  to  better  prepare  for  and  cope  with  permanent changes in the automotive industry, which have a major impact on the labor market.\n\nThese  two  global  framework  agreements  constitute  structuring social dialog themes.\n\n## Increasingly heightened and broadened A. vigilance on respect for fundamental social rights /uni00A0EFPD4a/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD6a/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD6b/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD6c/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD6d/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD17a/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD17c/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD17d/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD18/uni00A0\n\n## A historical commitment\n\nIn  October  2004,  Groupe  Renault  published  a  'Declaration  of Employees' Fundamental Rights'.\n\nThe  two  global  framework  agreements  renew,  strengthen  and complement  these  commitments,  in  particular  with  regard  to  the effective  abolition  of  child  labor,  the  elimination  of  all  forms  of forced  or  compulsory  labor,  the  elimination  of  discrimination  in respect of employment and occupation, freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.\n\nThe 2013 agreement thus refers to International Labor Organization Conventions  Nos. 87,  135  and  98 on  freedom  of  association, protection of the right to organize, workers' representatives, and the right to collective bargaining. It also incorporates Conventions Nos. 29 and 105 on the abolition of forced labor and Nos. 138 and 182 on the effective abolition of child labor and the minimum age. Finally, it includes  Conventions  No. 111 on  the  prevention  of  discrimination,\n\nNo. 100 on  equal  compensation  and  No. 158 on  termination  of employment.\n\nThe  2019  agreement  incorporates,  in  the  same  year  that  it  was adopted  by  the  ILO, Convention  No.  190 , disavowing  any manifestation  of  workplace  violence,  harassment  in  all  its  forms, particularly  sexual  or  moral  harassment,  or  discrimination  against employees.\n\n## A vigilance plan in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms in consultation with internal and external social actors /uni00A0DV1a/uni00A0\n\nAs part of the implementation of French Law No. 2017-399 of March 27,  2017  on  the  duty  of  vigilance,  a  mechanism  has  been implemented for the monitoring of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe aim is, in light of our industrial and commercial activities and the diversity of the countries in which Renault operates, to identify the risks incurred and to draw up a map, based in particular on reports published by the ILO , which may go beyond the fundamental social rights  identified  within  the  global  framework  agreements.  It  is  on this  basis  that  Groupe  Renault  has  decided  to  pay  particular attention to the implementation of ILO Convention No. 100 (Equal Compensation)  and  ILO  Convention  No.  111  (Discrimination, Employment and Occupation).\n\nThis  monitoring  system  is  supplemented  by  feedback  from  the Group's various departments, and more specifically, from the Ethics and  Compliance  department  (section  2.5.1.3)  and  the  Purchasing department,  from  European  and  international  social  partners,  as well  as  from  the professional  whistle-blowing  system ,  which  is accessible  to  Group  employees,  external  or  occasional  employees and suppliers. Any alerts are addressed in a specific item during the plenary sessions of the Worldwide Group Works Council.\n\n## Assessment and monitoring of measures implemented /uni00A0DV2a/uni00A0\n\nThe  results  of  this  additional  vigilance  are  regularly  assessed  and monitored as part of annual follow-up meetings between the Groupe Renault  Works  Council  and  the  Worldwide  Group  Works  Council. Please  note  that  two  sections  of  the  new  2019  Global  Framework Agreement are devoted to the Group's sustainable commitment to inclusion and respect for people.\n\n## Risk mitigation actions /uni00A0DV3a/uni00A0\n\n88.45%  of  the  Group's  employees  are  covered  by  a  collective bargaining agreement at branch and/or company level.\n\nThe Audit department now includes knowledge of and compliance with  global  framework  agreements  in  its  local  audits  of  Human Resources practices. In the event of any difficulty in applying these agreements, the memorandum concluded in January 2018 with the signatories  of  the  2013  framework  agreement  provides  practical guidance  for  both  parties  to  deal  with  them  jointly.  In  addition, training  opportunities  and  raising  awareness  among  local  Ethics Committees  are  being  studied.  They  should  enable,  through examination  of  risks  at  the  level  closest  to  the  operations,  better identification  of  at-risk  situations  in  matters  of  human  rights  and appropriate solutions to be applied.\n\nIn this context, in February 2020, the International Labor Relations department,  in  partnership  with  the  ILO,  organized  a three-day",

Training focused in  particular  on  industrial  relations  systems  in  Europe,  trade  union and  collective bargaining freedoms,  and  the  application  of fundamental social rights in supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Effectiveness of measures /uni00A0DV5a/uni00A0\n\nThe effectiveness of initiatives in place is measured notably by the number  of  incidents  reported  by  signatory  parties  to  global framework  agreements  resulting  in  the  implementation  of  the measures provided for in the 2018 memorandum. No incidents were measured under the memorandum in 2020.\n\n## A decisive criterion when choosing suppliers and subcontractors\n\nGroupe Renault has committed, through its 2013 Global Framework Agreement,  to  ensuring  that  respect  for  fundamental  rights  is  a decisive criterion in the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. If necessary, corrective action plans are implemented with the support of  the  Group.  Any  failure  not  corrected  after  observation  results  in measures that may extend to the termination of relations with the company  in  question  (section  2.5.2  and  policy  accessible  on  the Renault Responsible Purchasing website).\n\n## Respect for people\n\nGroupe Renault counts respect for privacy and the protection of its employees' personal data as fundamental human rights. In 2020, the roll-out  of  the  information  and  training  plan  continued throughout the Group.\n\n## The Worldwide Group Works Council, a forum B. for responsible social dialog /uni00A0EFPD4a/uni00A0\n\nThe Worldwide Group Works Council has 40 members:\n\n- European  Economic  Area:  31  members  (Germany,  Austria  and P Switzerland,  Belgium,  Netherlands  and  Luxembourg,  Spain, France,  Italy,  Poland,  Hungary,  Slovakia  and  Czech  Republic, Portugal,  Romania,  United  Kingdom  and  Ireland,  Slovenia  and Croatia);\n- other  countries:  nine  members  (Argentina,  Brazil,  South  Korea, P India, Morocco, Russia and Turkey).\n\nIt is the essential forum for social dialog at the international level : its  members  regularly  discuss  major  changes  in  the  Group  and  its strategic  orientations  with  the  Group's  General  Management  and operational  departments.  When  an  exceptional  proposed  decision has  transnational  consequences  likely  to  significantly  affect  the interests  of  employees,  the  Group  Works  Council  meets  as  a European Works Council.\n\n2020 was marked by the difficulties encountered by Groupe Renault (a  proposed  \u20ac2  billion  savings  plan  resulting  in  the  loss  of  15,000 jobs worldwide) and the COVID-19 crisis, which led to the closure of many  industrial  and  commercial  sites  in  March,  with  furlough measures for those jobs that could not continue on site and the use of telework wherever possible.\n\nI\n\nIn this very particular context, maintaining permanent social dialog was  essential to  provide  employees  with  appropriate  support. Although  the  annual  plenary  session  could  not  be  held,  given  the health measures and travel restrictions around the world, the Group Works Council Restricted Committee met remotely no fewer than 35 times this year, with major concerns being the health measures to be implemented on site and the monitoring of the implementation of those  measures,  as  well  as  the  monitoring  of  the  Group's commercial, financial and social situation. Discussions were also held on  the  feedback  of  employees  surveyed  on  their  experience  of telework during the first period of lockdown.\n\nMore specifically, the proposed plan to save \u20ac2 billion by 2022 was\n\nthe subject of discussions with certain business lines concerned and a dual consultation-information process. The first consultation-information meeting, on June 26, concerned the terms of international social dialog on the implementation of the plan (the Group Works Council Restricted Committee, meeting as a European Works Council, issued a favorable opinion). The second consultation-information  meeting,  on  October  21,  focused  on  the implementation  of  this  plan  in  the  Engineering,  Manufacturing  & Supply Chain, Finance and Marketing and After-Sales functions. The European  Works  Council  issued  an  unfavorable  opinion  on November 10, after a break in the meeting allowing it to consult all of its members.\n\nFinally, the Group Works Council was able to discuss, very early on, the General Management's Renaulution project and the Group's new organization, which is now focused on four brands (Renault, Dacia, Alpine  and  New  Mobilities),  and  the  gradual  implementation  of these organizations.\n\n\"In 2020, all members of the Group Works Council participated fully in  building  Groupe  Renault's  resilience,  notably  through  practical initiatives  such  as  presentations of health protocols at Group level and  the  sharing  of  best  practices  between  countries  on  their application.  The  Group  Works  Council  also  played  its  full  role  in social dialog at Group level, with a very strong and unprecedented dynamic: a record number of meetings, remote meetings, whether restricted,  extraordinary  European or global, with all the members of the Committee, from Argentina to South Korea\".\n\n\u00c9ric Vidal, Secretary of the Worldwide Group Works Council.\n\n## Ongoing local social dialog /uni00A0EFPD4b/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD4c/uni00A0 C.\n\nIn  France,  the  agreement signed by the CFDT, CFE-CGC and FO on January 13, 2017 relating to the years 2017, 2018 and 2019, called the  \"Renault  France  -  CAP  2020  -  Agreement  for  the  sustainable performance  of  Renault  in  France'  ended  with  positive  results.  It focused on three areas: customer satisfaction, sustainable performance and motivation of the Company's women and men and incorporated business and performance commitments.\n\nSocial dialog at Renault in France in 2020 was structured around two main topics:\n\n- the follow-up to CAP 2020 and the savings plan; P\n- management of the health crisis.

        "page_content": "## The follow-up to CAP 2020 and the savings plan\n\nAfter a phase of joint reflection on the challenges of the post-CAP 2020 period, the social partners agreed to start negotiating a 2020 Method and Transition Agreement .  This agreement was signed on March 6, 2020 by the CFDT, CFE-CGC and FO. It sets out themes for future negotiations. For 2020, it maintains the previous GPEC system with activity exemptions, continued recruitment and training efforts within Renault s.a.s. and the subsidiaries concerned.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the savings plan on May 29, 2020, an amendment to the 2020 Method and Transition Agreement was signed  on  July  24,  2020  by  the  CFDT,  CFE-CGC,  CGT  and  FO.  The amendment defined, for each of the projects linked to the savings plan in France, a joint work schedule and the social dialog structures to support it.\n\nAs  part  of  the  implementation  of  this  amendment,  business  line observatories were organized for corporate functions. Their work led to the negotiation of an agreement on the Transformation of Skills in  Global  Functions ,  signed  on  November  20,  2020  by  the  CFDT, CFE-CGC  and  FO.  This  agreement  concerns  the  strengthening  of skills, the adaptation of the workforce and the organization of local social dialog within the business lines.\n\nLocal method agreements were also concluded for the other projects related to the savings plan.\n\n## Management of the health crisis\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the health situation and the  company's  activity  led  to  the  signature,  on  April  2,  2020,  of  a Solidarity and Future Contract .  With  this  agreement, Renault sets the  terms  and  conditions  for  managing  furlough  measures  and access  to  training  during  this  period,  and  undertakes  to  guarantee 100% of its employees' net pay.\n\nMoreover,  on  July  10,  2020,  an  agreement  was  signed  on  the Organizational Procedures for the Election of Directors Representing Employees on the Board of Directors .\n\nOn  November  19,  2020,  the  agreement  in favor  of  people  with disabilities was renewed for a period of three years.\n\nInternationally , exchanges  with  local  unions  were  intensified, following  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  to  guarantee  the  working conditions of all employees around the world, by agreeing to:\n\n- health measures to be implemented for those businesses whose P activities continued on site;\n- measures  to  generalize  teleworking  for  employees  whose P activities allowed it;\n- conditions for supporting furlough schemes, in line with local laws. P\n\nSeveral countries and subsidiaries (RCI, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, South  Korea,  Romania)  have  renewed  agreements  governing  local employment conditions.  In  Argentina  and  Brazil,  agreements  were reached  on  employment  measures  in  the  event  of  a  decline  in industrial activity, and in Spain, the first meetings on the renewal of the convenio were held.\n\n## Long-term convergence between Group D. performance and employee quality of life in the workplace\n\nGroupe Renault endeavors to offer all its employees an environment and  working  relationships  that  are  favorable  to  their  individual development and improve their quality of life at work.\n\nThe Group wishes to support its employees - the primary agents and contributors  in  the  sustainable  development  of  the  Company -  in moving  towards  new  modes  of  work  that  promote  collaboration, agility, living well together and versatility within the Company.\n\nWorking environments are gradually becoming more flexible and, by improving quality of life, enhance the performance of the Company.\n\nThe  use  of  mass  telework  in  2020  during  periods  of  lockdown brought  to  light  new  expectations  among  employees  in  terms  of professional  workspaces.  Thus,  the  priority  is  to  find  on  site  the means  to  develop  collaborative  work  and  conviviality,  all  in  the greatest  possible  comfort.  To  put  these  expectations  into  practice, various  pilot  schemes  were  put  in  place  in  2020  and  will  continue over 2021; they include the Real Estate department pilots on the Le Plessis-Robinson  and  Guyancourt  sites.  In  the  same  vein,  the Technocentre  renovation  program,  known  as  Re-TCR,  will  also include trials with new workspaces.\n\nIn the industrial plants, particular attention is paid to the provision of  light,  whether  this  is  natural,  artificial,  or  a  combination  of  the two,  to  reducing  noise  nuisance  and  to  means  of  ventilation  and aeration, particularly in cases of hot weather. The Group intends to eventually roll out LED lighting to all plants.\n\nThe  use  of  digital  technology is  developing  everywhere.  In  the industrial  sector,  smart  automation  and  connectivity  of  software, data and equipment are gradually revealing the factory of the future. This  new  digital  landscape  smooths  access  to  information  in real-time  and  facilitates  decision-making.  It  also  enables  staff  to access,  at  any  time,  the  Group's  intranet  and  social  information concerning them, including from their own smartphones if they so wish.  Testament  to  this  is  smartphone  access  to  the  new People@Renault HR information system in all countries.\n\nThe  prevention of  psychosocial  risks  and  work-related  stress remains a priority for Groupe Renault. To provide the best possible support to employees in the context of the health crisis, a support system has been put in place. In France, this relies on occupational health  services,  facilitators  and  coaches  within  the  company,  and aims  to  help  employees  and  managers  live  and  organize  work  as efficiently as possible in this new context. In addition, as part of the support provided for the implementation of the skills transformation agreement, a monitoring and support system for the prevention of psychosocial risks has also been implemented.  It includes communication  and  awareness-raising  measures  on  psychosocial risks, training courses and reinforced support, both on an individual and a collective level.\n\nI\n\n02",

It aims to find the  best  possible  balance  between  the  Company's  interests  and quality  of  life  in  the  workplace  for  the  employees  in  question, through  consultations  with  employee  representatives  and  labor unions.  The  measures  focus  in  particular  on  the  conditions  for reorganizing work time, such as by adding mandatory shifts to meet heavy demand or reducing work time when demand falls, notably by using individual or collective rest days.\n\nAt  sites  in  France,  for  example,  the  average  working  week  is 35 hours. In plants, the principle is two alternating eight-hour shifts with, in the event of spiking demand, the possibility to add a fixed night shift team.\n\nGroupe Renault is also introducing an alternative, flexible work time organization,  allowing  a  better  personal  work/life  balance  for  its employees  with,  for  example,  telework  in  countries  where  this  is possible. The  global framework  agreement  signed  in  2019 strengthened this aim.\n\nIn  France,  telework  has  been  part  of  our  agreements  for  13  years. The last agreement, signed on February 7, 2019, will make it easier and simpler to access telework by responding to changes in working modes  and  new  employee  expectations.  In  particular,  it  facilitates access  for  eligible  employees  to  two  days  of  telework  each  week, after registration in the new dedicated workflow, with the option to have  regular  sessions  or  use  them  in  a  variable  manner.  The emergence  of  the  COVID-19  crisis  and  the  lockdown  measures imposed on the entire French population on March 16, 2020 resulted in  full  telework  for  all  employees  whose  work  could  be  performed remotely.  To  protect  the  health  of  its  employees,  the  company maintained this work organization until the start of the new school year  in  September  2020.  This  was  followed  by  a  period  where telework  was  set  at  a  minimum  of  three  days  per  week,  with  the requirement  to  have  only  60%  of  usual  workers  present  on  the \u00cele-de-France  sites  in  order  to  guarantee  everyone's  health  safety. The  second  period  of  lockdown  starting  on  October  30,  2020 reactivated the switch to full telework until the end of 2020. As early as  mid-2020,  the  company  sought  to  draw  lessons  from  this unprecedented  period.  Through  surveys  and  working  groups,  the company  noted  the  enthusiasm  of  its  employees  for  the perpetuation  of  hybrid  working  methods,  combining  on-site  and telework.  Thus,  it  is  planned  to  begin  discussions  with  the  social partners in early 2021 to initiate thinking on a new organization of work incorporating the new expectations expressed by employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health, safety, ergonomy and the environment (HSEE) /uni00A0EFPD3/uni00A0 2.4.2\n\n## Duty of Vigilance\n\nAs part of its duty of vigilance (1) , Groupe Renault has established and implements a vigilance plan.\n\nGroupe Renault, together with its stakeholders, defined measures for reasonable  vigilance  covering  health  and  safety  of  persons  in  its global  framework  agreement  of  July  2,  2013 (2) .

The rules capture a wide range of topics including: 5S (focusing  on  establishing  and  sustaining  order,  tidiness  and cleanliness),  work  on  installations  (Lock  Out  Tag  Out),  managing access  to  dangerous  parts  of  machinery,  traffic  management  (safe site,  safe vehicle, safe driver), storage and handling of heavy loads, chemical management,  working  at  height, management  of subcontractors, fire prevention, ergonomics and many other topics.\n\nTo date, the DHSEE performed 308 10MR site audits, which equates to  approximately 1,170 departments simultaneously engaging with thousands  of  employees.  League  tables  showing  the  level  of progress by percentage compliance and ranking for audited sites in respective business domains are now established.\n\nManufacturing sites have developed in house 10MR Dojos as part of their information, instruction and training induction programs.\n\nIn 2019, the DHSEE  developed  Mandatory  Rules  and  Key Requirements to support health, environment, ergonomics, fire and projects. These rules were to be tested on various sites throughout 2020.  This  was  only  partially  achieved,  due  to  the  pandemic (COVID-19)  taking  priority  and  the  intense  involvement  of  the DHSEE in supporting the COVID-19 exposure control measures and business continuity.\n\nSimultaneously  the  number  of  physical  safety  10MR/74KR  audits and  coaching  carried  out  during  2020  by  DHSEE  was  severely impacted by the constraints linked to the pandemic.\n\nNevertheless,  capabilities  to  conduct  remote  audits  and  coaching were also carried out successfully using live communication tools. At the same time, the sites were trained so that they will  be able to carry out self-assessments.\n\nFurthermore,  and  in  order  to  apply  the  hierarchy  of  control upstream,  DHSEE  project  team  accompany  the  projects  through their milestones to promote inherent safe design of the installations which will enter in the sites and their conformity to all Mandatory Rules.\n\n## Procedures for regular assessments 2.4.2.2 /uni00A0ECD3a/uni00A0 /uni00A0DV2a/uni00A0\n\n## Field assessments A.\n\nThe  DHSEE performs follow-up  audits  based  on  established  10MR compliance  roadmap  guidelines.  However,  there  is  flexibility  to accommodate other factors such as a special request made by a site, an  incident,  performance,  launch  of  a  new  project,  introduction  of new technology, etc. The need as to where, when and why analyzed with the DHSEE and discussed with the sites.\n\nThe number of audits carried out by DHSEE during 2020 has been greatly  reduced  due  to  the  constraints  linked  to  the  pandemic (lockdowns, teleworking, travel restrictions) and the priority given to protect personnel from exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nOverall, in 2020, there were 13 official audits of which three were in the manufacturing scope.\n\nNevertheless,  DHSEE  continually  helps  the  sites  to  develop self-assessment capabilities and as such sites continue to self-check with  remote  support  from  DHSEE  (however  we  continue  to physically engage in the field when the conditions permit).\n\n## Statistical assessment to complement field B. assessment\n\nHSEE  statisticians  have  performed  an  intense  pareto  analysis  of historical incidents stemming 10 years which includes no fewer than 6,000 incidents. This helps us pinpoint the effect of the Mandatory Rules on areas of risk and incident causation and allows us to adapt our strategy in relation to incident prevention.\n\nThis is further epitomized with a dedicated team inside the DHSEE, tasked with working upstream on projects whose primary objective is  to  integrate  prevention  in  design.  In  parallel,  this  team  works closely  with  the  field  experts  to  identify  areas  in  serial  life  that through redesign could have eliminated residual hazards.\n\n## Appropriate risk mitigation actions 2.4.2.3 /uni00A0DV3a/uni00A0\n\nA  brief  overview  of  some  of  the  key  areas  we  are  working  on  is presented below.\n\n## Project Management A.\n\nThree  dedicated  DHSEE  correspondents  are  assigned  to  support HSEE matters upstream in projects:\n\n- From the earliest stage of the project to ensure HSEE deliverables P are  compliant  at  each  milestone,  in  particular:  inherent  safe design.\n- By applying risk assessments and hazard characterization. P\n- In  deployment of training courses for project management, thus P enhancing awareness of HSEE requirements (legal and specific to Renault).\n- By  provision  of  tools  for  managing  HSEE  compliance  in  projects P and the publication of an HSEE information gazette for all players involved.\n- In  managing  effective  two-way  feedback  between  projects  and P HSEE.\n\nThe correspondents work in collaboration with other DHSEE experts and with Engineering to produce standards, guides and norms to be applied. To this end, during 2020, the DHSEE project management team created Five Project Mandatory Rules to be tested during 2021.\n\nI\n\n02",

In 2018  seven  (7)  members  of  the  DHSEE  team  visited  AVTOVAZ  to work in  collaboration  with  the  local  team  and  establish  a  baseline reference  point  from  which  improvement  initiatives  were  defined and  a  dynamic  PDCA  created.  Since  then,  DHSEE  and  other specialists  have  undertaken  14  weeks  of  Gemba  visits  to  conduct coaching and audits.\n\nAmong the topics are:\n\n- reporting and analysis of accidents; P\n- 10 mandatory rules and 74 criteria deployment; P\n- safety DOJO implementation; P\n- machinery improvements (LOTO, guards, RFID switches, etc .); P\n- fire risk assessment (plastic injection plant); P\n- forklift upgrade and floor marking; P\n- integration of HSE in projects. P\n\nThanks  to  a  new  efficient  team  on  site  and  strong  support  of Management,  the  results  are  visible  on  the  Gemba  and  safety performances are improving.\n\n## Fire safety C.\n\nDHSEE defined nine (9) specific fire  safety  mandatory  rules,  which will be tested in several sites during 2021. The purpose is to build on the  back  of  the  success  of  the  10  Safety  Mandatory  Rules  using identical  compliance  roadmaps  inclusive  of  ranking  according  to tried  and  tested  criteria.  These  in-house  rules  are  a  good  practice reference  point  and  generate  a  focus  on  this  key  area  of  risk management.\n\nDHSEE  is  also  working  in  collaboration  with  the  Risk  Prevention Division to enhance the Hot Work Permit. The enhanced permit has been tested  in  the  field  on  several  sites,  feedback  has  been  taken into consideration and adaptations are being made accordingly.  In parallel we are working jointly with the Risk Prevention Division to establish  Risk  Assessment  models  as  well  as  reviewing  documents and procedures covering all aspects of fire safety.\n\n## Contractor management D.\n\nRenault  appointed  established  safety  software  solutions  experts who  cover  this  essential  area  of  risk  management.    The  aim  is  to build a single unified Contractor Safety Management platform which will enable us to manage the entire contractor safety lifecycle which covers five key elements.\n\n- Streamline  and  standardize  the  pre-qualification  processes  to 1. ensure contractors are properly vetted for EHS risks.\n- Ensure  contractors  have  been  properly  trained,  competent  and 2. onboarded before they arrive on site.\n- Conduct  pre-job  Task  and  Risk  Assessments  and  establish 3. task-hazard controls to minimize and mitigate risks.\n- Monitor  and  supervise  work,  flag  EHS  issues  that  need  to  be 4. corrected, and evaluate contractors, EHS performance to identify high-risk contractors when future contract work is needed.\n\nI\n\n- Establish a complete overview of all ongoing works by means of a 5. site map, allowing a better view of co-activities.\n\nThe contractor management platform is in the first phase of testing in several sites.\n\n## Machinery and Equipment E.\n\nAll  Manufacturing  sites  have  recorded  interventions  by  providing videos  demonstrating  how  Lock  Out  Tag  Out  procedures  are performed. The sharing of visual evidence has enabled coaching and feedback  to  the  sites  for  best  practice  for  ensuring  how  the  safe isolation of machinery is achieved.\n\nConsidering  machinery  safety,  tools  and  procedures  have  been developed to mitigate machinery related risks which, just to mention a  few,  essential  safety  requirements  for  suppliers,  inspection check-sheets and risk assessment.\n\nThe procedure for approval new installations is an evolution of the CCS  ( Constat  Conformit\u00e9  S\u00e9curit\u00e9 ) document,  which  has  been updated  to  current  European  and  international  standards  and directives.  Included  in  this  update  is  the  aspects  relevant  to machinery safety, rules number 2 and 3 of the 10 Mandatory Rules for site safety.\n\nDuring this year's activities, safety inspections for machinery in serial life has also been considered with the development of an inspection tool  that  can  be  applied  to  all  types  of  machinery  to  identify potential  safety  hazards.  This  allows  the  relevant  teams  to pro-actively identify hazards and discuss suitable control measures to be put into place.\n\nTo  enable  an  open  discussion  platform,  the  Machinery  Safety  Club was created in 2020. The new installation process tool and the safety inspection  procedure  has  been  communicated  through  this  club which,  to  date  has  seen  over  90  people  attend.  Training  on  these new tools has been provided to over 170 people.\n\n## Electric and hybrid vehicles F.\n\nElectric  and  hybrid  vehicles  are  one  of  the  major  projects  for  the company.\n\nSafety is integrated upstream in the design of the product. Standard solutions are implemented in all electric and hybrid vehicles (ex: BJA - Hybrid CLIO in 2019, BCB in 2020).\n\nIn order to eliminate or reduce access to hazardous energies:\n\n- there  is  a  lockout  and  tagout  procedure  for  each  EV  in  order  to P isolate  and  lock  out  energies  before  intervention  on  electric components;\n- the design of the high voltage batteries strongly reduces access to P live parts during assembly operations, as well as during repair and maintenance activities inside batteries.\n\nSafety  is  integrated  in  the  process  engineering  in  all  assembly activities and in vehicle repair activities.",

The theorical part of the new training program was supplemented by several practical exercises. It now includes a specific Dojo on the characterization of hazards and the implementation of safety rules.\n\nStandard workstation induction (SWI) has been included as a part of the new training program.\n\nThe implementation of the new training program is underway in the Douai plant.\n\nThe HSEE dimension has been strengthened in electric and hybrid vehicle projects from the product and process design stage in order to  make  the  work  of  plant  operators  and  after-sales  technicians safer. All the players involved in these projects have been trained.\n\nIn  the  scope  of  transportation  and  concerning  the  EV  battery, guidelines  and  training  sessions  on  regulatory  requirements  for suitable  packaging,  test  of  battery  before  transportation,  were implemented by the internal Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor.\n\n## Traffic Management G.\n\nDHSEE  in  collaboration  with  impacted  functions  developed  three complementary risk mitigation tools:\n\n- traffic memorandum (Reference Guide), A)\n- risk assessment method (Safe Site, Safe Vehicle, Safe Driver), B)\n- procedure for the safe reception of flows and automated guided C) vehicles (AGV's).\n\nStandards have been produced on topics such as:\n\n- safe forklift truck (FLT): verification prior to use, and P pedestrian-FLT proximity detector and speed reduction;\n- safe material handling vehicles (MHV): equipment to be seen and P heard;\n- safe truck: loading and unloading of trailers uncoupled from the P cab;\n- safe storage: rack regulations. P\n\n## Renault working with the ECG H.\n\nECG is the Association of European Vehicle Logistics and provides a platform  for  the  finished  vehicle  logistics  sector  in  Europe.  In October  2017  during  the  biannual  Industry  Meeting  between  the ECG board and senior logistics managers of the OEMs a passionate call  for  the  establishment  of  a  cross-industry  working  group  to reduce  accidents  in  vehicle  logistics  was  made.   Renault  was  very quick to support this initiative and the ECG Health & Safety Working Group was born.\n\nThe first meeting of this working group identified road transport and 'falls from height' as the priorities since these generally account for the most serious accidents. Regrettably, fatalities are not unknown.\n\nSince then several sub-groups have been formed, all of which have been  very  active.  A  number  of  documents  have  been  produced  in\n\nmany languages including  'Safe  Loading  Process'  and  'Safe  Yards'. Training  courses  have  been  run  across  Europe  to  support  'safe loading'  and  an  industry  website  has  been  produced  to  encourage truck operators to upload details of incidents to enable analysis and promotion of the results to allow everyone to learn from them.\n\nECG is grateful to all those who have participated in, and supported, this working group for their efforts in helping to make our industry a safer  place  for  our  employees.  No-one  should  ever  be  injured delivering a car - and this is the goal we all aim for.\n\n## Ergonomics /uni00A0EFPD3a/uni00A0 I.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Ergonomics  department  supported  11  vehicle projects with a focus on inherent ergonomics design.\n\nIn  parallel  a  new  risk  assessment  process  was  introduced  which consists of three main elements and covers all business scopes. Ergonomics memorandum, Workstation evaluation methodology  &  Ergonomic  Mandatory  rules  all  of  which  were finalized in 2020. All elements will be utilized upstream in projects to eliminate the introduction of ergonomic constraints whilst simultaneously  applied  in  serial  life  to  identify  opportunities  to enhance working conditions.\n\n## Ergonomics memorandum 1.\n\nThe memorandum is a reference guide which encompasses standard ergonomic  principles,  adapted  to  all  fields  of  activity.  It  has  been widely distributed  within  the  company  in  booklet  and  digital  form, and is available in three languages.\n\n## Ergonomics evaluation method 2.\n\nThe workstation ergonomics assessment methodology was improved in consultation with the Global Ergonomics Network and other key partners.\n\n## Ergonomics Mandatory Rules 3.\n\nThe key criteria's and experience gathered from all previous works has been consolidated into 6 Mandatory Rules.\n\nA  deployment  roadmap  has  been  established  which  consists  of training supervisors who will be shadowed by ergonomic specialists. The  aim  is  to  perform  intense  risk  assessments  with  a  view  to identifying new opportunities to improve working conditions as part of the departments' continuous improvement approach.\n\n## Training J.\n\n## NEBOSH International General Certificate\n\nThe NEBOSH International General Certificate (IGC) in Occupational Health  &  Safety  is  an  internationally  recognized  health  and  safety qualification  from  an  established  independent  examination  board with over 25 years' experience in providing up-to-date and relevant examinations.\n\nI",

More  correspondents  will  be  trained  in  the coming years.\n\n## CMSE \u00ae /uni00A0- Certified Machinery Safety Expert (CMSE)\n\nCMSE\u00ae is  a  globally  recognized  qualification  enabling  a  360\u00b0 approach to machinery safety. It was born of a partnership between two  international  leaders  in  their  respective  fields,  Pilz  and  TUV NORD.\n\nPilz as the Expert in Machinery Safety.\n\nTUV NORD as the International Certifier.\n\nThe  training  covers  Introduction  to  Safety,  Machinery  Safety Legislation, Risk Assessment, Mechanical Guarding, Safety Components  and  Technologies,  Electrical  Safety,  Functional  Safety of Control Systems & Functional Safety of Pressurized Fluid Systems.\n\nTo  date,  eighteen  (18)  Groupe  Renault  employees  have  obtained CMSE certification.\n\n## ISO 45001 occupational health and safety standard\n\nISO  45001  is  an  ISO  standard  for  management  systems  of occupational health and safety, published in March 2018. The goal of ISO  45001  is  the  reduction  of  occupational  injuries  and  diseases, including promoting and protecting physical and mental health.\n\nDuring 2020 Fourteen (14) HSEE correspondents have been trained by  Association  Fran\u00e7aise  de  Normalization  (AFNOR)  the  French national organization for standardization.\n\n## Specific workstation induction\n\nThe Specific HSEE workstation induction is a formal and structured process by which all Operators (including temporary Operators) are informed  about  hazards  &  control  measures  associated  with  their specific  workstation.  This  is  a  process  developed  to  enhance operator  awareness,  to  encourage  proactivity,  to  promote  good behaviors  with  the  ultimate  objective  of  preventing  accidents  and incidents.\n\nThe Specific workstation induction (SWI) standard process implemented  in  2017  as  a  pilot  project  in  all  the  sites  of  Iberia Region  (Portugal  &  Spain)  was  extended  in  2020  through  specific workshop in Cl\u00e9on (France) to be adapted for global roll-out. In the Iberia  region,  81%  of  supervisors  and  74%  of  operators  have  been trained according to this methodology.\n\n## HSEOS & good practices\n\nHSE Operational standards (HSEOS) are deployed worldwide with a view to sharing important requirements about a given topic. During 2020, 70 HSEOS were shared.\n\nIn  addition,  good  practices    compiled  in  a  common  format  are circulated  globally  to  exchange  knowledge and ideas. During 2020, 62 good practices were shared.\n\nBoth HSEOS and good practices are shared via HSE club m\u00e9tiers.\n\nI\n\n## Accidents simulations & transversal memos\n\nVideo simulations have been created  based on pre-selected accident scenarios  and  then  shared  worldwide  for  awareness  raising.  Since 2019,  12  simulations  have  been  created  and  viewed  by  more  than 8,200 individual viewers from inside the company. Feedback about this type of communication is very positive, as the simulations show the basic sequence of events leading to the accident. To share these communications with a wider audience, they are now translated into English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian.\n\nDuring the accident analysis, as soon as the appropriate risk control measures have been identified, they are summarized and shared via a dedicated Transversal Memo which is also shared worldwide.\n\n## Virtual reality hazard hunt\n\nNew technologies, including virtual reality, have been used to create and  deploy  digital  hazard  hunts  in  different  environments:  namely industrial, logistics & dealerships. Trainees can experience the virtual environment thanks to oculus VR headsets.  The visual hazard hunts can  also  be  adapted  on  PCs  and  large  TVs  using  joysticks,  as  they would for any regular game. This new digital training, available in 9 languages, enhances awareness with positive feedback coming from the users.  New modules are under preparation to enhance machine safety awareness as well as operating cranes.\n\n## Device for monitoring the measures 2.4.2.4 and their effectiveness /uni00A0EFPD3a/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD3b/uni00A0 /uni00A0DV5a/uni00A0\n\n## Digitalization\n\nThe HSEE department has improved its tailor-made digital tool for reporting, alerting about and monitoring occupational accidents and illnesses. This digital tool covers the entire Groupe Renault business scope.\n\nStatistical data are compiled each month and shared with all Group Renault  entities  with  information  by  Groupe  Renault,  regions  and activities.\n\nThe  system  is  designed  with  an  integrated  alert  system  where-by sites alert top management and other key correspondents within 24 hours of an incident.\n\nAnother module developed in the digital application is a root cause analysis  tool  which  helps  identify  the  systemic  causes  of  the incidents  and  monitor  subsequent  corrective  actions.  One  of  the outputs of the system is the manual creation of transversal memos which cover the particulars of the incidents in question and these are shared through Club M\u00e9tiers which are delivered in 3 languages.\n\nAnother  output  of  the  digital  tool  is  the  ability  to  establish  the immediate  cause  of  the  incidents  and  quickly  generate  incident simulations  which  are  shared  with  key  personnel  in  the  company, including the highest hierarchy right up to the CEO.\n\nTo  date,  the  simulations  delivered  have  acquired  8,400  hits,  which equates to more than 500 hours, viewing with the viewing audience being much larger than the 8,400 hits.",

It defines a list of  injuries  that  exceed  a  certain  severity  level  of  which  the  Group wants to focus in order to prevent the recurrence of such accidents. The Group is also promoting 1 st aid acts accidents and continues to improve  the  declaration  process,  even  in  countries  where  such accidents are not legally requested to be declared.\n\nSince  2017,  the  FR1  ratio  has  continuously  decreased  from  2,5  in 2017 to 1,8 in 2020 this in despite of the FR1 definition becoming more and more stringent every year. The main evolutions being the integration of temporary workers in 2018, the extension of the injury list  to  include  sprains  and  strains  in  2020  and  the  incorporation  of the  AVTOVAZ entity.  To  give  some  idea  of  size  in  business  teams, AVTOVAZ  is  similar  in  size  to  all  of  Europe's  manufacturing. AVTOVAZ is several years behind in deploying the Group HSEE tools but deployment is well underway and making good progress.\n\nAfter careful consideration and on the back of the success of the FR1 reduction we have decided to switch from FR1 to FR2 indicator as the  main  workplace  accident  indicator  for  2021.  Several  pre initiatives allow us to set a baseline which will allow us to drive the FR2  indicator  down  below  the  FR1  indicator  over  time  whilst keeping the FR1 stable.\n\n## TRENDS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accidents on public roads /uni00A0EFPD3b/uni00A0\n\nThe DHSEE is heavily involved in road safety, supporting colleagues in the field of social responsibility. Commuting accidents covers any accident occurring on the public highway e.g. between the workplace and  home,  between  the  workplace  and  a  supplier's  site,  between home and a supplier's site, etc .\n\nTraffic  accidents  that  occur  within  the  geographical  coverage  of Renault  sites  are  monitored  as  part  of  the  workplace  accident frequency rate.\n\nIn countries where information about traffic accidents is available to employers, the company can use this data to consolidate the figures and draw up robust action plans.\n\nInformation on Groupe Renault's actions to reduce road accidents is provided in the CSR section of the URD (see section 2.3.2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndue to traffic accidents\n\n## Health\n\nThe  Industrial  health  department  consists  of  11  dedicated  experts with  access  to  laboratory  facilities.  They  manage  a  wide  range  of health-related  topics  including,  among  others,  the  control  of workers' exposure to hazardous substances and chemical compliance covering the CLP/GHS/REACH regulations.\n\nOur primary objective is to reduce the number of the most hazardous chemical substances on Groupe Renault sites. The most hazardous chemicals, classified as 'priority 1' (PR1) by Renault for replacement,  include  products  containing,  among  others,  category 1A/1B CMR (Cancerogenic, Mutagenic and Reprotoxic) and endocrine disruptors  substances.  Since  2010  to  2019,  we  have  eliminated  or avoided  the  use  of  around  400  PR1  chemicals.  During  2020  we managed to eliminate more than 60 PR1 chemicals.\n\nOne  of  the  main  initiatives  during  2020  was  the  launch  of  eight Health & industrial hygiene mandatory rules, which are supported by 65 explanatory key requirements.\n\nThe rules have been developed with the involvement of the global health and medical networks. The rules cover chemical, physical and psychosocial  risks.  Key  requirements  are  established  to  assess  and mitigate risks using the hierarchy of control, promote risk awareness and develop worker training.\n\nI\n\n02",

The rules cover chemical, physical and psychosocial  risks.  Key  requirements  are  established  to  assess  and mitigate risks using the hierarchy of control, promote risk awareness and develop workers training.\n\nThe launch was impacted heavily by the pandemic, which forced us to focus on measures to mitigate the risk of contracting the disease. Our primary focus was to ensure supply of efficient hand sanitization products  and  surface  disinfectant.  To  meet  the  needs  of  all  sites around the world, more than 150 products were examined and 130 validated  for  their  effectiveness  against  COVID-19  and  compliance with our HSE requirements.\n\nThe  psychosocial  field  is  a  key  area.  Preventing  psychosocial  risk requires  cross-cutting  and  multidisciplinary  work.  In  2020,  a psychosocial prevention specialist joined the DHSEE to structure the management of psychosocial risks. The first action was the drafting of  a  specific  Mandatory Rule with 11 supporting key requirements. Preventive  actions  are  also  carried  in  partnership  with  other prevention stakeholders (HR and the medical team), for example:\n\n- provision  of  guidelines  to  help  managers  give  the  best  possible P support to employees throughout the COVID crisis;\n- participation in working groups to analyze impacts of new ways of P working (teleworking);\n- contribution to the monitoring of psychosocial risks in the context P of the transformation of technical and tertiary skills.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe Environment department includes 20 experts in various fields of environmental  engineering  such  as  soil  remediation,  air  emissions, waste management, water treatment, regulation, and environmental management.\n\nThe  activities,  achievements  and  targets  of  this  department  are extensively described in the 'Environment' section of this report.\n\nIn  addition  environmental  risk  mapping  will  be  greatly  enhanced with the roll-out of the eight Environmental Mandatory Rules/50 Key Requirements. This new tool, built on the example and on the back of  the  success  of  Safety  Mandatory  Rules,  captures  all  relevant topics  as  far  as  the  environment  is  concerned:  Soils,  Air,  Wastes, Water Supply, Waste water, Legionella, Noise and Compliance. The tool was designed in 2019 and 2020 and was to be tested on various sites  throughout  2020.  The  Covid-19  pandemic  forced  us  to  adapt the test phase and carry out audits and coaching sessions remotely. The roll-out phase will begin in 2021; over a 3-year timeframe, it will cover  all  manufacturing,  sales,  after-sales  and  logistics  sites.  A self-assessment phase will be carried out initially, with the remote support of the DHSEE. This phase will include Gemba validation.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Occupational illnesses /uni00A0EFPD3a/uni00A0 2.4.2.5\n\nThe figures communicated are reported occupational illnesses. After analysis by the authorities, some of the illnesses were declared to be not attributable to Renault.\n\nThe steady downward trend in the occupational illness rate came to a  halt  in  2020.  The  process  for  declaring  occupational  illnesses  in Romania,  simplified  at  the  end  of  2019  and  therefore  in  place throughout the whole of 2020, explains this change.\n\n4/5  occupational  illnesses  are  musculoskeletal  conditions.  This demonstrates  even  more  the  importance  of  the  Ergonomics Mandatory Rules implemented in new projects.\n\nMore  generally,  improved  project  integration  since  mid-2018  will contribute to future progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group absenteeism /uni00A0EFPD2b/uni00A0\n\nThe  rates  vary  greatly  from  one  country  to  another,  particularly because of the extent of social security coverage (whether provision is covered  by  public  bodies  or  not).  The  rates  changed  very differently  in  2020  compared  to  2019,  depending  on  the  impact  of the  health  crisis  in  the  different  countries.  Overall,  the  increase remains limited, with a rate of 3.61% in 2020 compared to 3.28% in 2019.\n\nThe absenteeism rate is expressed as a percentage and is calculated on  the  basis  of  the  average  monthly  workforce  and  the  yearly theoretical number of working days.\n\nThe  number  of  days  of  absence  is  expressed  in  working  days, excluding  short-time  working,  layoffs,  strikes,  training  and  leave (including  maternity  and  paternity  leave).

Groupe Renault recognizes that providing training on the careers of the future and giving the neediest access to knowledge are keys to the development of society and also of the Company. Renault therefore continues to deepen its commitments in this area.\n\n## Bringing schools into the corporate 2.4.3.1 world\n\nGroupe Renault is committed to developing talent throughout life, especially among young people, by helping them find their place in the world of work. Groupe Renault develops programs and initiatives to forge links between the worlds of education and employment, and to professionalize and develop their employability, with a particular focus on the promotion of diversity and equal opportunities.\n\n## In France... A.\n\n2020  was  a  complex  year  in  terms  of  school  relations  due  to  the health crisis in France, marked by the closure of a number of schools for  certain  periods,  new  operating  methods  (distance  learning courses, virtual school forums, etc.) and the cancellation of courses during the first period of lockdown.\n\nDespite this context, Groupe Renault was able to maintain its links with schools and young people in particular:\n\n- at the end of December, 1,814 young people were on work-study P programs  in Groupe Renault in France (including 1,636 apprenticeship contracts and 84 CIFRE training through research contracts). While many companies have reduced their recruitment of  apprentices,  Groupe  Renault  has  chosen  to  maintain  its recruitment  and  support  young  people.  Thus,  of  the  1,636 apprentices present, 1,020 were recruited in 2020;\n- by welcoming 520 young people in internships, of which just over P 100  had  been  cancelled  during  the  first  lock-down  (338 internships  were  cancelled  when  the  partial  activity  work  mode was introduced in March 2020);\n- for the fourth consecutive year, an internal forum for work-study P students and interns at the end of their contracts was organized, this  time  virtually  via  Teams  (usually  held  in  person  at  the Technocentre) with CV, cover letter and social network coaching workshops led by the Group's recruiters;\n- some  20  events  such  as  conferences,  talks,  school  forums, P coaching  sessions  and  round  tables  took  place  in  virtual  format this year, led by Renault recruitment officers or ambassadors;\n- the  \"TWIZY  Contest\"  innovation  challenge  devoted  to  new P mobility  solutions  in  the  context  of  the  2020  Olympics  was maintained,  with  a  French  final  on  September  28  (10  French teams participating) and an international final where teams from seven countries will compete in December;\n- by providing financial support to 129 educational institutions and P approved  organizations  through  the  apprenticeship  tax.  As  a result of the reform of apprenticeship and its funding, the share of the tax distributed by employers has fallen (13% instead of 23% previously),  leading  to  a  drop  in  the  number  of  organizations supported this year.\n\n## ... but also in other countries where the Group B. operates /uni00A0EFPD14d/uni00A0\n\nMany employees spend some of their  work  time  teaching  classes  at different  schools/universities.  These  activities  are  organized  either through official partnerships or at schools and universities in countries where Renault operates.\n\nFor  example,  in  partnership  with  the  local  university, Renault Argentina is developing workshops run by company employees and aimed at the local community to enhance skills and employability in areas  including  IT,  job  search  assistance  and  preparing  for  job interviews.  In  2020,  more  than  300  people  participated  in  these workshops, held remotely due to the health crisis:\n\n- the  Renault  Argentina  Foundation is  particularly  active  in  this P area:\n- for  example,  it  grants  scholarships  to  students  attending  the P Technical Institute located near the plant. In recent years, more than 800 scholarships have been awarded,\n- in partnership with Fundaci\u00f3n S\u00ed, a nationwide NGO working for P the  inclusion  of  vulnerable  populations,  it  supports  the University residence program, which grants four scholarships to underprivileged students to enable them to attend university,\n- in partnership with TED, it supports the TED-Ed Clubs Program, P aimed  at  high  school  students  to  teach  them  how  to  select themes  they  are  passionate  about  and  how  to  express  them effectively  in  the  TED  format.  Since  2018,  more  than  40,500 students  and  6,200  teachers  from  1,900  schools  have  been involved in this program,\n- in  partnership  with  the  Education  department  of  the  city  of P Buenos  Aires  and  with  the  support  of  Renault  Academy,  it participates in the Professional Practices program  and organizes workshops and training for students and teachers on car  repair,  electric  cars  and  garage  management.  By  2020,  35 technical education  institutions  had  participated  in  this program;\n- the Renault Foundation Colombia continues  to  provide  support P to  underprivileged  engineering  students  through  its Renault German Camilo Calle program;\n- in Romania , Groupe Renault has partnerships with 15 universities. P The Group also supports vocational training and has been involved in the development  of  future  generations  of  automotive specialists  since  2014.  Since  then,  261  students  (from  two technological high schools in Mioveni and Pitesti) have participated in internships in Mioveni.\n\nI\n\n02",

        "page_content": "## GROUPE RENAULT: A/uni00A0COMPANY THAT ACTS RESPONSIBLY\n\nOUR SOCIAL COMMITMENT\n\nGroupe  Renault,  well  aware  that  knowledge  is  acquired  by  the practical application of academic knowledge, made numerous gifts of vehicles and tools to schools for educational purposes:\n\n- in France ,  many  plants  make  such  donations  for  educational P purposes to high school students in their area;\n- in Argentina , Renault  donates  test  vehicles  to  technical P institutions to be used for student training. Since the beginning of the  program,  more  than  100  vehicles  have  been  donated  to institutions  in  the  provinces  of  Buenos  Aires  and  Cordoba.  This action  has  a  three-fold  economic,  environmental  and  social impact: the destruction of test vehicles is avoided, final disposal of waste  is  avoided  and  it  contributes  to  the  training  of  future automotive industry employees;\n- in Morocco , Groupe  Renault  regularly  donates  its  used  and P upgraded  IT  equipment  to  schools  and  training  and  integration centers.  In  2020,  several  training  centers  for  underprivileged young people benefited from the provision of IT tools that allowed the continuation of courses during lockdown.\n\nTeacher  training  and  leadership  development ,  to  give  them  the means  to  transform  their  institutions,  inspire  and  bring  about change among young people, are further challenges for the company as great as that of training students:\n\n- the Renault  Argentina  Foundation , in  partnership  with  NGO P Fundaci\u00f3n Cordoba Mejora and the Renault Technology America (RTA)  department,  is  supporting  the  Leaders  in  Education program  for  secondary  school  principals  in  the  province  of Cordoba. It aims to improve the quality of education, reduce the number of school dropouts and promote equal opportunities for young people through leadership development strategies;\n- the Renault  Colombia  Foundation continued  its  collaboration P with the Empresarios por la Educacion Foundation in 2019 to train 20  school  principals  in  Envigado  (the  city  where  the  Groupe Renault plant is located). The program goes by the name Rectores lideres transformadores .\n\n## Supporting access to education 2.4.3.2 throughout the world\n\nGroupe Renault conducts a large number of CSR initiatives designed to promote inclusion, access to education and fight against student drop-out:\n\n- as  such,  the Douai  plant (France)  and  its  local  employment, P vocational  training  and  social  work  partners  have  been  working together  since  1999,  and  have  already  helped  more  than 1,500 people obtain a degree. Each year, a New Skills class starts preparing  for  a  qualification  as  part  of  a  professionalization contract.  With  the  Renault  Foundation,  the  Douai  plant  has supported the Lens Production School from the outset. Its support comes in the form of visits and the donation of an ESPACE. But it also includes sponsorship: the Groupe Renault Regional External Affairs Manager is sponsoring the second class going through the school.  The  Production  School  is  a  private  technical  school  that prepares pupils for CAP and bac pro diplomas and certifications.\n\nIn  addition,  the Douai  plant (France)  welcomed  high  school students from the Denain high school (Nord), in partnership with the  Elles  Bougent  association,  to  enable  them  to  meet  women working in industry who can talk about their careers;\n\nI\n\n- meanwhile,  in  2020, Renault  Argentina , supported  the  NGO P Mujeres 2000 through a program developed on a voluntary basis. For example, 15 employees from the marketing department, with the help of a communication agency, participated in the creation and development of digital workshops on business management for  vulnerable  women  supported  by  the  NGO.  In  Argentina,  in partnership  with  NGO  Las  Omas,  Renault  is  supporting  a community  program  for  a  vulnerable  population  living  in  the vicinity of the plant. In particular, Las Omas has set up a sewing workshop to train women and encourage them to set up their own businesses;\n- in Brazil , the Renault Experience innovation and entrepreneurship P program,  organized  by  the  Renault  Institute,  continued  into  its twelfth  consecutive  year.  The  program  is  aimed  at  students wishing  to  create  start-ups.  Candidates  whose  applications  are selected  by  the  Institute  benefit  from  a  year's  support  for  their project. On top of financial support, the winners are mentored by people  from  Renault  and  the  broader  automotive  world  and universities, who give them advice throughout the year. For more information, go to: http://institutorenault.com.br.\n- Future  Generation  is  another  important  vocational  training program targeting young people in socially vulnerable situations in Brazil .  This free six-month training course, intended for young people aged 15 to 24 who are still enrolled in secondary school or who have completed their schooling, is designed to prepare them for  entry  into  the  labor  market.  It  includes  courses  in  computer science,  management,  citizenship,  behavior  and  civics.  In  2020, courses were held at a distance due to the health crisis. A total of 21  young  people  graduated  from  this  second  class.  Of  the  40 students in the first class, who graduated in 2019, 18 have found jobs  or  are  doing  internships  at  Renault  do  Brasil  or  other companies in the region, despite unfavorable health and economic conditions;\n- in Morocco , Renault contributes to improving school conditions in P the  province  of  Fahs  Anjra.  It  encourages  the  schooling  of children,  in  particular  girls,  and  is  fighting  to  reduce  school drop-out rates in rural areas through the supply of school buses, and  initiatives  such  as  educational  workshops.  A  total  of  1,900 pupils  benefited  from  the  school  transport  service  every  day  in 2020 thanks to the Renault Morocco Foundation . In addition, the Foundation has enabled the opening of four pre-school classes in the province of Fahs Anjra, which since 2018 has been welcoming more than 90 children from the region each year.\n\nThe educational approach was reinforced with two new initiatives in 2020:\n\n- the  adaptation  of  the  Bibliobus  project,  launched  in  2019,  to P effectively support school children in the current health context. Initially designed to bring culture closer to young people in rural and  peri-urban  areas,  the  2020  edition  integrated  teacher training  through  distance  learning,  as  well  as  a  pedagogical approach to tutoring for all primary school levels,\n- the  scholarship  program  for  deserving  baccalaureate  students P in  the  town  of  Melloussa,  from  which  four  young  people have benefited for this first year of launch.\n\nThe  Renault  Maroc  Foundation is  also  very  involved  in  the prevention of  road  risks.  With  the  Tkayes  school  initiative,  more than  8,000  children  and  their  families  benefited  from  the  road safety education program in 2020.",

Present in 39 countries, the Company considers  that  it  has  a  responsibility  to  make  sure  that  its  impact  on  the  regions  where  it  is  located  is  positive  and  to  contribute  to  their sustainable development. The Group's ambition is to create shared value for the mutual benefit of the Company and all of its stakeholders. It therefore takes care to identify the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders that surround it (2.1.5) and to respond to them as far as possible through its core business and setting up innovative solutions.\n\n## An active participant through its core 2.4.4.1 business activities /uni00A0EFPD14b/uni00A0\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  truly  isolate  the  Company's  contributions  within  a complex  and  interdependent  socioeconomic  tissue.  Beyond  direct employment  generated  and  the  taxes  paid  by  the  Company,  the other  direct  and  indirect  contributions  and  benefits  are  shared among the members of a network.\n\nAccording to the figures published by the ACEA, the association of European automotive manufacturers, 14.6 million people - representing 6.7% of the active population - work in the European automotive sector (direct and indirect jobs).\n\nThe  number  of  direct  jobs  totaled  2.7  million  (2018  data).  This includes automotive manufacturing, equipment and accessories, and coachbuilders.  Indirect  employment  includes  other  manufacturing fields, vehicle sales, parts and accessories, maintenance, fuel, leasing and  transportation,  as  well  as  construction  and  road  maintenance and associated activities.\n\n## An active participant through its 2.4.4.2 philanthropic activities /uni00A0EFPD15b/uni00A0\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  regularly  approached  by  NGOs,  charities, volunteer organizations and employees seeking support for projects in  the  areas  of  general  interest,  solidarity  or  good  citizenship,  in areas  linked  to  its  CSR  policy.  In  responding  to  such  requests,  the whole Group follows the sponsorship procedure defined in 2019.\n\n## The corporate sponsorship activities of the Groupe Renault Foundation\n\nUntil  June  2020,  the  Sponsorship  Committee  determined  the allocation of donations to charities on the basis of calls for projects.\n\nIn this context, the Foundation launched a call for external projects in 2020. It supported the associations Les Z'enfants de l'Auto and the\n\nMass\u00e9-Tr\u00e9vidy Foundation in the amounts of \u20ac15,000 and \u20ac20,000 respectively, as part of the Roulez Jeunesse scheme for obtaining a driving  license.  Since  June  2020,  donations  have  been  decided  on directly by the Board of Directors.\n\n## The art collection\n\nGroupe  Renault's  art  collection  is  now  managed  by  the  Renault Foundation,  whose  purpose  is  to  promote  the  Group's  modern  art collection,  which  includes  more  than  300  works  by  some  30  major artists  such  as  Arman,  Doisneau,  Dubuffet,  Tinguely  and  Vasarely, and make it accessible to as many people as possible.\n\n## Groupe Renault Foundations\n\nSome Group subsidiaries now carry out their philanthropic activities within  a  foundation  or  similar  structure.  This  not  only  strengthens governance  and  strategy,  but  also  demonstrates  the  importance given  to  the  identified  issues  from  both  an  internal  and  external standpoint. Financed locally, they are chaired by the Chief Executive Officer  of  Renault  in  the  country.  Since  2009,  the  Head  of  the corporate Foundation is represented within the governance of each new Foundation.\n\nThe Foundations' corporate purpose, as identified in the articles of association,  encompasses  all  or  part  of  the  Group's  CSR  priorities. The activities performed on behalf of the Foundations are primarily aimed at populations outside the Company, and range from the local to  the  international,  depending  on  the  country  and  the  programs implemented.  The  activity  reports  are  available  directly  on  their respective websites.\n\nEvery month since October 2020, the Renault Foundation has been meeting with local Foundations in order to share best practices or advise  them  in  their  approach.  A  strategic  amalgamation  of  all foundations  around  the  new  Corporate  Foundation's  new  purpose will take place from 2021.\n\nI\n\n02",

Funded by the Moroccan  State,  it  was  set  up  by  Renault  Tangiers,  which  now ensures  delegated  management  to  provide  a  public  training service for the automotive professions.\n\nI\n\nThis  center  has  provided  training  for  all  employees  of  Renault Tangiers and a significant portion of employees at the Casablanca Plant and at Renault Commerce.\n\nThrough  its  Maintenance,  Manufacturing,  Logistics  and  Lean Manufacturing  schools,  IFMIA-TM  has  provided  training  and support  services  for  Renault  in  Morocco,  France,  Algeria  and Colombia.\n\nIn addition to its training role for Renault, IFMIA-TM also provides training  and  support  for  employees  of  around  30  partner companies  and,  since  2014,  participates  in  the  Moroccan Professional  Bac  project,  thereby  playing  a  part  in  developing young people's skills and employability;\n\n- in  France,  in  June 2014  the  Company  made  a  commitment P alongside  the  French  State  and  local  authorities  by  signing the Company  and  Neighborhoods  Charter ,  thereby  undertaking  to work closely with public authorities to deliver concrete solutions to the economic, social and cultural development issues in priority neighborhoods, in line with city policies. In addition to the Charter, Renault  signed  an  agreement  detailing  its  commitments  in  the following areas:\n- education and vocational guidance. Through the Elles Bougent P organization, Renault has committed to expanding its network of  female  engineers  and  technicians  who  encourage  young female  high  school  and  university  students  to  enter  the engineering and transportation professions,\n- employment, integration and training: (i) under the terms of the P Framework  Agreement  signed  by  Renault  and  the  Ministry  of Work, Employment, Professional Training and Social Dialog, the Group  has  committed  to  employing  at  its  plants  a  number  of young people experiencing difficulties in entering the workforce. Particular  attention  is  paid  to  recruiting  young  people  from priority  neighborhoods  near  to  our  sites,  (ii)  via  its  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  des Automobiles  Alpine  subsidiary,  Renault  has  taken  part  in  the '50 chances,  50 jobs'  (now  '100 chances,  100 jobs')  program  in the  Dieppe  region  of  France.

The  Group  is P continuing  its  roll-out  of Garages  Renault  Solidaires (see section 2.4.5.2), and is promoting the program to social partners on  a  national  level  in  order  to  continually  enhance  its  social impact;\n- in  2015,  Renault  signed  the  first local  agreement with  the P Hauts-de-Seine  department  (92).  Since  then,  six  other  local\n\nagreements  were  signed  with  the  Essonne  (91),  Seine-Maritime (76), Yvelines (78), Territoire de Belfort (90), Gironde (33) and Nord (59) departments. The aim of these agreements - which are local versions of the commitments contained in the national agreement signed by Groupe Renault - is to pay particular attention to the priority  neighborhoods  defined  in  the  Government's  city  policy, and to contribute to the effectiveness of the city policy, through HR and CSR actions and projects developed by the Group.\n\n## Making mobility as widely accessible as possible 2.4.5\n\n## Affordability and physical accessibility 2.4.5.1\n\n## The 'global access' range\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  working  towards  making  cars  more  democratic with its so-called 'global access' range, sold under the Dacia brand name in Europe, and under the Renault brand name in most other parts of the world. Thus, Groupe Renault offers a range of affordable vehicles  for  customers  subject  to  financial  constraints  or  those wanting  to  spend  just  enough  to  secure  a  reliable,  sturdy  vehicle. The  global  access  range  corresponds  to  a  mid-range  purchase  in emerging countries and to an entry-level vehicle in Europe. To offer entry-level vehicles in emerging markets, in 2015, Renault launched the KWID, a new vehicle based on a shared Alliance platform known as CMF-A, in India.\n\nThe  brand  has  enjoyed  great  commercial  success  thanks  to  iconic models such as the LOGAN, SANDERO and DUSTER. In 2019, Dacia achieved record sales of 737,000 vehicles over the year, and now has nearly 6.5 million customers.\n\n## Widely accessible spare parts\n\nWith  regard  to  service,  Groupe  Renault  has  developed  a  more affordable  range  of  spare  parts  to  make  mobility  accessible  to  the greatest number of people.\n\nSince  1998,  Renault  has  offered  a  full  range  of  parts  equivalent  in terms  of  safety  and  functionality  to  the  original  vehicle  parts, whatever the brand. Marketed under the Motrio brand and adapted to the requirements of Renault vehicles aged over five years and to Dacia  and  other  brand  vehicles  aged  over  four  years,  the  Motrio range now has more than 7,500 references, in 57 different product families.  This  range  is  compatible  with  24 automotive  brands  and nearly 300 vehicle models.\n\nCurrently,  Motrio  is  present  in  around  50 countries  worldwide  and the  brand  even  has  its  own  multi-brand  garage  chain.  Building  on this success, Motrio is naturally continuing its international growth, and  has  committed  itself  to  the  crucial  digital  and  e-commerce channels for closer contact with its customers.\n\nFor  many  years,  Renault  has  also  been  developing  alternatives  to new parts. In 2012, Renault created an after-sales refurbished parts service. In anticipation of the requirements of the Royal law on the use of parts from the circular economy in automotive repairs (which came into force in 2017), Renault's sales network offers used body parts (hoods,  fenders,  headlamp  units, etc. ) in France  and mechanical parts in France that have been collected and selected in Indra's  approved  network  of  ELV  (end-of-life  vehicle)  centers.  This service is particularly of interest to customers whose vehicles are not economically repairable using only new parts.\n\nFinally,  for  more  than  70 years  Renault  has  offered  a  standard exchange  service,  which  involves  the  industrial  refurbishment  of mechanical parts such as engines, gearboxes, starters, compressors, steering  columns, etc . In  2017,  the  service  was  extended  to electronic  parts  with  a  range  of  refurbished  multimedia  systems. This new business area is a major development area for the standard exchange service. The refurbishment of electronic parts has been a natural addition to the Choisy-Le-Roi plant's refurbishment activities,  and  is  in  line  with  both  technological  developments  and customer  needs.  The  used  parts  are  collected  in  the  distribution network,  sorted  and  refurbished  according  to  a  rigorous  industrial process.  These  renovated  ('standard  exchange')  parts  are  sold  to Renault  vehicle  owners  at  a  lower  price  than  new  parts  while satisfying the same quality requirements (see section 2.2.2.3).\n\nRenault pays particular attention to adapting its spare parts pricing to  the  change  in  the  residual  value  of  its  vehicles,  in  order  to optimize  their  reparability,  particularly  for  bodywork  repairs.  The cost of repair is an essential criterion for insurers to avoid premature scrapping.  Thus,  between  three  and  six  years  after  the  date  of launch,  depending  on  the  range,  Renault  concentrates  its  price reduction  efforts  on  parts  related  to  passive  safety  (airbags,  seat belts, dashboard, etc. ). Likewise, from the cessation of marketing of vehicles,  the  price  of  bodywork  parts  (bumpers,  doors,  wings, etc. ) and glazing regularly drops each year.\n\nI\n\n02",

        "page_content": "OUR SOCIAL COMMITMENT\n\n## Renault Tech: mobility solutions to serve disabled people\n\nFor  more  than  10  years,  Renault  Tech,  a  wholly-owned  Groupe Renault subsidiary, has placed people with reduced mobility at the focus of its concerns, offering them a complete range of adaptations to  Renault  and  Dacia  vehicles,  and  enabling  them  to  travel  in complete autonomy and safety whether for business or pleasure.\n\nThrough  Renault  Tech,  Groupe  Renault  is  the  only  European manufacturer engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of vehicles dedicated to the transport of people with reduced mobility.\n\nRenault  Tech  adaptations  include  vehicle  adaptations  to  transport wheelchairs (access ramps, internal fittings), swivel or exit seats to assist  with  wheelchair transfers and driving aids (accelerator/brake hand  control,  steering  balls,  multi-function  remote  controls etc. ). This  offer  is  available  in  the  whole  of  the  French  distribution network, and internationally via Renault subsidiaries.\n\nEach  year,  more  than  1,000 adapted  vehicles  leave  the  factory  at Heudebouville in Normandy and the Renault Tech site located in the Renault plant at Sandouville.\n\nFor almost 20 years, Renault has had a partnership with F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise  Handisport  (the  French  Disability  Sports  Federation),  to which it provides financial support and adapted vehicles.\n\nwww.renault.fr/vehicules/mobilite-reduite.html.\n\n## A committed socially responsible 2.4.5.2 player\n\nAlthough  mobility  is  a  key  element  for  the  social  and  professional inclusion  of  people,  millions  of  them  nevertheless  remain  limited every  day  in  their  travel.  Penalized  by  financial,  geographical  and social hindrances, too many people have to give up a job or a training course quite simply because they cannot get there.\n\nAs a major player in mobility, Groupe Renault therefore decided to act for more inclusive and socially-responsible mobility by setting up a social entrepreneurship program that aims to favor the mobility of the most vulnerable.\n\nInitiated in 2011 and officially launched in France in July 2012, this program is  drawn  up  in  cooperation  with  players  in  the  social  and cooperative  economy,  the  academic  world  and  the  public  sector. Innovative  partnerships  have  been  forged  in  this  framework  to promote entrepreneurship and encourage inclusive mobility projects to  emerge  with  P\u00f4le  Emploi  (the  French  government  employment service),  Restos  du  C\u0153ur  or  ADIE.  We  are  aiming  for  this  to  be extended as widely as possible within the Company in France and in all the other countries where it is present, it is applied in three areas of intervention:\n\n## Develop specific offers intended for vulnerable 1) people\n\nThis  concerns  the  development,  with  a  viable  entrepreneurial approach,  of  projects  that  have  meaning  for  the  employees  of  the Group, its customers and its partners, maximizing the social impact rather than the profit.\n\nI\n\n## Garages Renault Solidaires\n\nThe Garages Renault Solidaires (GRS) offers are intended to support people who need a car to work but who cannot afford the financial cost.\n\nRenault's network of garages voluntarily helps low-income individuals  identified  by  welfare  providers  (charities,  mobility platforms,  welfare  organizations,  employment  partners, etc. )  by offering them servicing and repair work at cost price but maintaining Groupe  Renault  service  quality.  Since  2019,  customers  whose  cars are at the garage for work can receive a free-of-charge replacement vehicle from Identicar (for a maximum of three days). Only garages providing a Renault Rent rental service qualify for this offer. In this way, 1,500 people were directed to this program in 2020, and nearly 10,000 since its launch.\n\nFurthermore, in 2018, in partnership with the Enterprise and Poverty Action Tank and several partner welfare providers (at-entreprise-pauvrete.org), Groupe Renault implemented a long-term  lease  scheme  with  purchase  option  linked  to  a micro-credit loan on its new passenger cars (Dacia SANDERO from \u20ac80 including tax per month) and light commercial vehicles (Renault KANGOO  from  \u20ac210  including  tax  per  month).  These  services  are exclusively aimed at individuals who are not eligible for conventional loans. Diac (Groupe Renault's finance company for the Renault and Dacia brands) is a stakeholder in the scheme, which was offered to nearly 4,500 potential beneficiaries in 2020.\n\nResults obtained in 2020 show that the program is actually reaching its  target:  74%  of  recipients  of  the  LOA  offer  have  household incomes  below  \u20ac1,000  net/month.  These  results  also  highlight  a target  market  that  encompasses  more  women,  with  54%*  of recipients over the entire offer being female.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  within  the  Renault  network  there  were  nearly 320 Garages Renault Solidaires across France. A dedicated website has been set up to enable a step change in the program and its social impact:  https://mobilize.groupe.renault.com/.  The  application  has evolved  considerably  during  the  year,  to  cope  with  a  forecast increase in people seeking help from the program. This is expected to  be  generated  by  a  forthcoming  communication  to  the  general public, with a corresponding significant increase in the social impact of the program;\n\n## Financial investment in social businesses 2)\n\n## A socially responsible investment company -/uni00A0Mobilize Invest/uni00A0- and company mutual investment fund (FCPE)\n\nMobilize  Invest  s.a.s. has  been  offering  funding  and  support  since 2012 to innovative entrepreneurs developing mobility solutions for people in difficulty. Renault contributed \u20ac5 million to this company's capital.  Mobilize  Invest  is  a  certified  Solidarity  and  Social  Utility Enterprise  company  (ESUS).  The  capital  provided  by  Renault  is increased by contributions from the employee savings funds through the  intermediary  of  the FCPE  Renault  Mobilize  Solid'air .  In  2020, the latter changed its investment to strengthen the environmental impact  while  maintaining  its  commitment  to  solidarity.  This  fund grew by 5.02% in 2020.",

        "page_content": "The  Management  and  Investment  Committee  (CDI)  is  the  central governance body of Mobilize Invest s.a.s. The CDI is chaired by the Director  of  the  Group's  Expert  Leaders,  an  Expert  Fellow  and member of Renault's Management Committee. It has 14 members, including one employee representative and two prominent external figures specialized in investment and social business.\n\nMobilize Invest s.a.s. has already provided funding (capital or debt) for  14  projects,  appointing  Renault  employees  as  mentors.  The details  of  the  companies  supported  can  be  found  on  the  website https://mobilize.groupe.renault.com/ mobilize-invest.\n\nThe companies supported by Mobilize Invest are asked to measure the social impact of their respective activities. A common framework of  nine  result  and  activity  indicators,  put  together  with  HEC,  was deployed in 2018. All companies are participating in the scheme in this way:\n\n- Nino Robotics is a startup that meets the mobility needs of those P who walk little, with difficulty or not at all, with a modern electric sit-on  transportation  machine  or  an  electric  wheel  to  power  a manual  wheelchair.  Groupe  Renault's  support,  which  will  be implemented in December 2019, extends from product design to distribution;\n- ADIE is  an  association  that  offers  microcredit  to  people  who  do P not have access to bank loans. ADIE set up the first French social impact contract in 2016 to pilot the distribution of microcredit in rural areas. In 2019, 206 people benefited from microcredit thanks to this contract, including 44% to finance mobility (purchase/repair of a car);\n- Salvum offers  digital  training  in  first  aid.  In  September  2019, P Salvum  launched  a  specific  module  for  road  rescue,  which  has been  offered  to  more  than  1,200  people  since  then.  In  2020, Salvum developed several modules to raise awareness of viruses, including coronavirus.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2018,  Groupe  Renault  introduced  a  system  to objectively measure the social impact of each of its social business initiatives.  In  2019  this  system  was  strengthened  and  extended.  A survey of 1,011 people, conducted by MV2 and HEC in June 2019 to assess  the  social  impact  of  the  Garages  Renault  Solidaires, highlighted  the  following  for  people  who  had  benefited  from  this program:\n\n- a high satisfaction rate: 8.4/10 for recipients of the LOA Mobilize P offer and 8/10 for APV Mobilize offer customers,\n- a  significant  impact  on  access  to  work: 78% of  recipients  of  the P LOA Mobilize offer and 64% of recipients of the APV Mobilize offer believe that the program has helped them to find or to keep a job,\n- the  lifestyle  satisfaction  rate  for  Mobilize  customers  questioned P was 8.4/10 ,  compared  with  6.5  for  non-Mobilize  customers  and the French average of 7.2;\n\n## Participate in the influence and development 3) of social entrepreneurship within the Company and outside\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  a  co-founding  member  of  the  'Movement  for Social  Business  Impact',  which  aims  to  promote  the  inclusive economy  by  supporting  research  and  teaching,  and  by  developing concrete projects having an impact on the reduction of poverty.\n\n## A Social Business Strategic Area of Expertise (SAE)\n\nIn  October 2018,  the  Group  decided  to  create  a  Social  Business Strategic Area of Expertise (SAE) under the CSR department, with a view  to  embedding  social  business  into  the  Company's  strategy alongside other traditional core business areas. This Social Business SAE complements the other SAE's of the Group and fosters a new perception of the Company's activities. It enables employees seeking more meaningful work-related initiatives and wanting to bring about change to get involved.\n\n## Training in inclusive business\n\nIn late 2018 and in 2020, training sessions were organized to enable around  20  employees  per  session  to  familiarize  themselves  with societal  challenges,  identify  corporate  responsibility  and  the  tools available  to  them  to  take  concrete  action  in  favor  of  a  more sustainable  world.  As  these  training  courses  are  increasingly  in demand  by  many  employees,  the  format  will  be  extended  and offered to international employees.\n\n## The HEC Paris Inclusive and Social Business Chair\n\n- Groupe Renault has sponsored this Chair (www.hec.fr/ P espace-entreprises/chaires-et-centres/social-business) since 2011 and  thus,  in  partnership  with  research  and  education,  works  to train  younger  generations  and  devise  new  social  business solutions.\n- Groupe Renault also collaborates with the Entreprise and Poverty P Action  Tank,  chaired  by  Martin  Hirsch  (Director  General  of Assistance  Publique  des  H\u00f4pitaux  de  Paris  (AP-HP))  and Emmanuel  Faber  (CEO  of  Danone)  to  share  existing  knowledge about  social  business,  hold  discussions  with  other  businesses committed to this approach and benefit from expert support and advice with the aim of ramping up the project.\n\n## Collectif des entreprises engag\u00e9es: a prescription banking platform\n\nIn February 2019, Groupe Renault joined the coalition of companies: the Collectif  des  entreprises  engag\u00e9es (Collective  of  committed companies), created at the end of 2018 at the initiative of Emmanuel Faber, CEO of Danone.\n\nFaced  with  the  social  protest  embodied  in  the gilets  jaunes movement  in  2018,  34  major  French  companies,  including  Groupe Renault,  have  come  together  in  the  Collectif  des  Entreprises Engag\u00e9es  to  join  forces  in  three  priority  areas: training  and apprenticeships,  access  to  inclusive  goods  and  services,  and responsible purchasing .\n\nI\n\n02",

The initiative is based on an economic model which makes leasing a new  vehicle  less  expensive  than  buying  a  very  old  used  vehicle. The latter  is  often  the  only  affordable  option  for  those  on  low incomes, but ends up being more expensive in the long term due to higher  maintenance  costs.  In  addition  to  its  positive  economic impact,  the  program  also  has  other  measurable  targets  including reducing  unemployment,  reducing  stress  and  insecurity  and decreasing CO2 emissions.\n\nWith this facilitation of access to goods, Groupe Renault in France is targeting 10,000 Mobilize LOAs (Leases with Option to Purchase) per year from 2023.\n\n## A pilot in shared mobility scheme in Africa\n\nFor  the  past  two  years,  the  CSR  and  Innovation  departments  have been  working  on  a  pilot  scheme  to  be  launched  in  2021,  that  will allow us to test the relevance of an electric and shared mobility offer based  on  mini  solar  plants  in  African  villages.  The  aim  is  to demonstrate  that  this  inclusive  mobility  solution  can  be  an accelerator for the economic and social development of rural areas in Africa.\n\n## Renault Corporate Foundation 2.4.6\n\nLaunched  in  2001,  the  Renault  Foundation  initially  focused  on supporting  associations  and  academic  programs  of  excellence directly  linked  to  inclusion  and  sustainable  mobility.  Aware  of today's  economic  and  social  concerns,  the  Renault  Foundation adopted  a  new  mission  in  the  second  half  of  2020,  focused  on integration  through  employment,  with  the  aim  of  supporting  and helping  people  excluded  from  employment  to  find  their  place  in society.\n\n## Promoting Renault as a socially responsible player in social integration\n\nTo  help  the  most  vulnerable  people  find  their  place  in  the  labor market, the Renault Foundation supports initiatives by associations in favor of professional integration, with a focus on proximity to the Group's  employment  areas  in  France.  The  projects  it  supports  are designed  to  restore  equal  opportunities  in  terms  of  professional integration, to create  bridges  between  the  educational  and\n\nI\n\nemployment  environments,  and  to  advise  and  support  vulnerable people in their efforts to find or return to employment.\n\nIn addition to supporting these associations, the Renault Foundation aims to engage employees on a unifying theme, thereby meeting the need  for  a  sense  of  purpose  that  is  increasingly  prevalent  in  their expectations.  That  is  why,  during  the  COVID-19  health  crisis,  the Foundation set up a platform to help employees get in touch with associations looking for volunteers or seeking financial donations.\n\nIn December 2020, the Renault Foundation reiterated this initiative by organizing a Christmas fundraising drive to support the Restos du Coeur.\n\nFinally,  with  the  end  of  its  support  for  academic  programs  in September 2020, the Foundation is supporting its last students (72 people) until they obtain their diplomas so that they can begin their professional lives.",

        "page_content": "ETHICS AND GOVERNANCE\n\n## Highlights of 2020 2.5.1.3\n\nRenault  has  been  audited  by  the  French  Anti-Corruption  Agency (AFA) under Article 17 of the Sapin II law  of  December 9, 2016. At the time of writing, Renault had not received the AFA report.\n\nThe  procedure  for  declaring  and  dealing  with  conflicts  of  interest and  the  related  training  have  been  rolled  out.  A  communication campaign  on  the  declaration  of  interests  of  senior  executives  has been conducted and will be repeated annually.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  set  up  a  procedure  for  managing  gifts  and invitations applicable to all of its entities.\n\nThe Group Ethics and Compliance department is now split into four divisions: ethics, professional alerts, compliance and the deployment division created in 2020.\n\nAn 'Inspiring Ethics' seminar was held in December 2020. It is part of  an  initiative  to  raise  awareness  of  ethics  and  compliance  for  all employees within Groupe Renault. The Chief Executive Officer was thus  able  to  develop  and  share  his  convictions  on  ethics  and compliance. Three external speakers followed one another in order to  nurture  the  thinking  of  all  attendees  on  subjects  as  varied  as 'meaning and leadership', 'normality and singularity at work' and finally  'ethical  questions  concerning  neuroscience'.  Lastly,  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  concluded  the  seminar  by stressing the Group's responsibility and interest in having an \"ethical backbone\" enabling it to develop sustainably.\n\nFive  information  sessions  on  the  Group's  ethics  and  compliance policy  were  given  to  the  business  management  committees  in  the plants and at a country headquarters.\n\n## Reinforcement of the ethics and compliance network\n\nThe network of ethics and compliance officers is now composed of 86 people. In order to improve the effectiveness and impact of the actions  of  the  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  department,  the network  of  officers  has  now  been  extended  to  new  countries  and subsidiaries.  A  total  of  37  officers  cover  all  countries  where  the Group operates. These officers are supported by five regional officers and  14  function  officers.  They  are  assisted  by  30  implementation leaders.\n\nThe Group Ethics and Compliance Department leads the network via e-conferences,  newsletters  and  an  annual  seminar.  Despite  the context of telework, health crisis and travel restrictions, contact was maintained  and  reinforced  through  individualized  exchanges  with each member of the network.\n\n## Deployment of the prevention of corruption and influence-peddling plan  EFPD16b\n\nThe law known as \"Sapin II\" of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernization of economic life, led  Renault  to  continue  to  strengthen  its  overall  prevention  of corruption  and  influence-peddling  policy,  in  particular  in  the following areas:\n\n- a renewed and increased commitment by governing bodies to the 1. prevention of corruption;\n- the corruption risk mapping approved by the Executive Committee 2. allows risks to be identified, assessed and prioritized. It includes in particular those risks inherent to its international activities or links\n\nI\n\n- with third parties. The various risks mapped are then taken into consideration when adjusting the Group's ethics and compliance policy;\n- the  Group's  Guide  for  preventing  corruption  and  influence3. peddling was deployed in all countries via operating committees, meetings  with  managers  and  team  meetings.  The  Guide  is  also available on the Renault website: www.group.renault.com;\n- the  Third  Party  Integrity  Management  Process  has  now  been 4. rolled  out  in  the  Group's  main  subsidiaries.  In  2020,  the  TIM process was integrated into the Delegation of Authority (DoA) for decisions requiring an opinion on the integrity of the third parties involved. In total, the level of coverage of third parties at risk was above 90% at the end of the year despite an increase in the scope of consolidation;\n- employees  and  managers  have  access  to  online  training  on  the 5. prevention  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling,  as  well  as  the detailed  presentation  of  the  Group's  prevention  plan.  In  2020, more  than  3,000  employees  attended  this  training.  This represents a cumulative total of 39,600 employees, i.e. , 94% of the population  registered  according  to  the  position  held  in  the company.  An  online  training  module,  \"Ethics  within  Groupe Renault\", was delivered to 25,800 employees;\n- a communication campaign launched at the end of 2019 reminded 6. everyone of the operation of the worldwide whistle-blowing tool implemented  in  2018.  Available  in  14  languages,  the  tool  is operational in almost all countries and is supported by the local ethics and compliance officers. It replaces the tool implemented in 2012.  It  allows  Group  employees  as  well  as  external  and occasional employees and suppliers to activate alerts directly with the Group Ethics and Compliance function. As a reminder, this tool brings together in a single system the three warning mechanisms provided for by the \"Sapin II\" law (general system, prevention of corruption and influence peddling) and the 2017 law on the duty of  vigilance.  It  is  accessible  confidentially  at  any  time,  on  an external  site,  from  a  computer,  tablet  or  smartphone,  both professional  and  personal.  During  2020,  new  initiatives  were conducted  to  raise  awareness,  in  particular  using  the  Group intranet;\n- in 2020, the Group Ethics and Compliance Department carried out 7. a  self-assessment  on  the  roll-out  of  the  corruption  prevention system  in  the  Group's  entities  and  subsidiaries.  This  CCQ (Compliance Control Questionnaire) received input from 33 subsidiaries  this  year.  Compliance  tests  were  conducted  on 11 entities to verify the quality of the responses and thus confirm the overall results. Eight audit assignments including a review of local  implementation  of  the  corruption  prevention  policy  were carried out in 2020.\n\n## Compliance with laws, regulations and corporate rules\n\nCompliance  with  laws  and  regulations  is  a  major  objective  of  the Group.  The  Group's  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  (CECG)  is responsible for monitoring these systems.\n\nThe  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  department  is  responsible  for overseeing regulatory compliance. It is responsible for ensuring that reliable  systems  are  in  place  for  the  departments  that  prescribe compliance:  Technical  Regulations  department,  Legal  department, Environment department, etc .

The Legal department provides support and assistance on this subject.\n\nThere  is  a  method  to  assess  existing  procedures,  validated  by  the CECG.  The  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  department  applies  this method  to  a  list  of  regulatory  areas  selected  with  the  Legal\n\ndepartment.  In  parallel  with  this  assessment,  a  rating  of  the seriousness of the risk of regulatory non-compliance is established with each prescribing department (see Risk factors, section 1.5.2.4).\n\nThe  system  as  a  whole  is  managed  by  the  internal  monitoring procedure for regulatory compliance.\n\n## Strengthening the responsible purchasing approach in the 2.5.2 supply chain /uni00A0EFPD15a/uni00A0 /uni00A0EFPD15b/uni00A0\n\nThe  Group  also  extends  its  social,  societal  and  environmental responsibility  to  its  relationships  with  suppliers.  Groupe  Renault implements a responsible purchasing policy along its entire supply chain.\n\nIn order to do this, Renault has incorporated compliance with social and  environmental  requirements  into  its  supplier  selection  and relations standards. 'Responsible purchasing' assessment  of suppliers  is  therefore  included  in  the  selection  criteria,  alongside quality,  financial  health,  strategy  and  industrial  and  logistical capacities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A CSR-focused purchasing team /uni00A0DV3b/uni00A0 2.5.2.1\n\nFor  over  ten  years,  Groupe  Renault  has  had  a  dedicated  team  to prevent serious infringements under the duty of vigilance law. The team reports to  the  Purchasing  department  and  has  the  following objectives:\n\n- ensuring  that  suppliers  meet  standards  and  comply  with  laws, P regulations and soft laws in social environmental and ethical areas ( e.g. the  law  on  the  duty  of  vigilance,  Sapin II,  traceability  of conflict minerals or cobalt, OECD/UN/ILO Guidelines, etc. );\n- improving  the  identification  and  reduction  of  CSR  risks  in  the P supply chain;\n- strengthening the extra-financial assessment of suppliers P (through an external provider and its online platform);\n- managing external CSR supplier audits; P\n- monitoring the implementation of appropriate corrective actions P by both direct and indirect suppliers;\n- coordinating  a  network  of  officers  within  local  Purchasing P departments.\n\n## Responsible purchasing policies, 2.5.2.2 cornerstone of the supplier relationship /uni00A0DV3b/uni00A0\n\nIn  order  to  prevent  serious  infringements  under  the  duty  of vigilance,  Groupe  Renault  relies  on  documents  which  set  out principles of responsible contractual relationships with suppliers:\n\n- Renault-Nissan 'Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)' guidelines P for  suppliers (December 2015). Distributed to all Groupe Renault suppliers  and  subcontractors,  this  document  summarizes  the Group's  CSR  expectations  of  suppliers  and  subcontractors  in matters  of  safety  and  quality,  human  and  labor  rights,  the environment, compliance and non-disclosure of information. The Group asks its suppliers and subcontractors to commit in writing to  comply with these guidelines. They are also requested to use them with their own suppliers;\n- Global Framework Agreement on social, societal and P environmental  responsibility.  Signed  on  July 2,  2013  with  the IndustriALL  Global  Union  and  the  Group  Works  Council  (see section 2.4.1.4).  Under  the  terms  set  out  in  chapter 3,  Groupe Renault  undertakes  to  communicate  the  Framework  Agreement to its suppliers and subcontractors. It requests them to commit to implementing  the  fundamental  social  rights  mentioned  in chapter 1  of  the  Framework  Agreement  in  their  own  companies and encourages them to do likewise with their own suppliers. If necessary,  corrective  action  plans  are  put  in  place  with  the support of Groupe Renault;\n- Renault Green Purchasing Guidelines (June 2018). This document P is  distributed  to  all  Groupe  Renault  suppliers,  and  describes requirements in matters of environmental management, policies on chemicals and recycling;\n- Groupe Renault policy on the supply of cobalt and minerals from P conflict-affected  and  high-risk  areas  (2019).  This  policy  provides suppliers  and  their  subcontractors  with  details  of  products  that may  contain  such  minerals,  and  the  Group's  expectations  as regards human rights and child labor in the supply chain.\n\nThe purchasing function also has a dedicated Code of conduct which complements  Groupe  Renault's  code  of  ethics.  This  document  is available on the Group's intranet site. It is aimed at all managers and employees  in  the  Purchasing  department  and  the  Alliance Purchasing Organization (APO), and at anyone who is in contact with suppliers and/or who has an influence on purchasing activities within Groupe Renault and/or for Groupe Renault. The code applies to all Groupe  Renault  purchasing  processes  and,  in  particular,  to compliance with Renault's strategy, to selecting suppliers, reviewing performance  and,  more  generally  speaking,  to  any  contact  or communication with suppliers.\n\nI",

The families of purchases have been classified according to P risks,\n- services.  The  families  of  purchases  have  been  included  in  a P nomenclature produced by an external service provider based on the criteria of the law on the duty of vigilance;\n- country  risks.  The  mapping  used  was  produced  by  an  external P service  provider  based  on  the  criteria  of  the  law  on  the  duty  of vigilance.\n\nThe combination of these two risk factors has enabled supplier and subcontractor  sites  to  be  ordered  according  to  four  levels  of criticality: 'low', 'medium', 'high' and 'very high'.\n\nFor  those  parts  production  facilities  or  service  provision  entities representing  the  highest  potential  risks  and  which  have  never undergone  a  CSR  assessment,  or  for  which  the  CSR  assessment  is not at the required level, external companies carry out audits on the ground.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  the  risks,  these  sites  are  audited  based  on  a triennial plan (2018/2019/2020).\n\n## Regular evaluation procedures for 2.5.2.4 suppliers and subcontractors /uni00A0DV2b/uni00A0\n\nTo  regularly  evaluate  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  Groupe Renault uses:\n\n- purchasing  processes which  incorporate  CSR  criteria  into P selecting suppliers and subcontractors to enter its panel but also for awarding new contracts;\n- an  Internet  platform (through  an  external  solution)  to  assess P suppliers'  and  subcontractors'  CSR  policies  and  actions,  and  to incorporate  the  CSR  performance  of  suppliers  into  purchasing decisions.\n\nFor  all  subjects  relating  to  the  content  of  these  documents,  any uncorrected  non-compliance  could  result  in  measures  being  taken that may include the termination of relations with the Company in question.\n\nI\n\nThus,  the  management  of  suppliers'  CSR  risk  is  integrated  into overall  risk  analysis,  just  as  financial  risk  or  strategic  risk  is integrated into overall risk analysis.\n\nIn  2020,  the  analysis  and  management  of  suppliers'  CSR  risks  has been deepened on the panel of the Top 500 Parts (BOP) and the Top 200  Services  (NBOP)  suppliers,  covering  88%  of  global  purchasing amount.\n\n## Actions to mitigate risks and prevent 2.5.2.5 serious infringements /uni00A0DV3b/uni00A0\n\nIn the context of mitigating risks and prevent serious infrigements, Groupe  Renault  has  commissionned  82 social,  environmental  and ethics  audits  of  supplier  sites  since  2018,  performed  by  external companies in six countries, including Algeria, China, India, Romania, Russia and Turkey.\n\nSpecific  emphasis was given to the monitoring of corrective action plans  put  in  place  by  the  suppliers  with  the  lowest  scores,  with mandatory re-auditing for these suppliers.\n\nIn  2020,  Groupe  Renault  continued  to  monitor  the  progress  of corrective  actions  taken  by  suppliers  who  obtained  insufficient results  in  audits.  In  Turkey,  several  suppliers  were  successfully re-audited, although for one of them a special monitoring plan was put  in  place  because  the  level  achieved  was  insufficient.  However, the coronavirus pandemic has had many consequences on follow-up activities, including the cancellation of a new audit campaign.\n\n## Professional whistle-blowing /uni00A0DV4/uni00A0 2.5.2.6.\n\nSee section 2.1.5, 'Professional whistle-blowing.'\n\n## System for monitoring the measures 2.5.2.7 implemented and evaluating their effectiveness /uni00A0DV5b/uni00A0\n\nGroupe Renault traditionally  measures  the  CSR  performance  of  its suppliers through two main criteria:\n\n- percentage  of  direct  purchase  volume  of  parts,  services  & P equipments covered by a CSR assessment;\n- percentage  of  total  purchase  volume  of  parts,  services  & P equipments covered by a high or very high grade CSR assessment.\n\nIn 2020, with the refocusing of efforts on the Top 500 parts suppliers and the Top 200 service providers, two new indicators were created to expand the number of suppliers assessed:\n\n- the number of parts, services and equipment suppliers subject to a P CSR assessment;\n- the number of parts, services and equipment suppliers whose CSR P score reflects high or very high performance.",

P\n\n## Specific work on the cobalt/electric 2.5.2.8 battery sector\n\n## Mapping of minerals and materials risks\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  particularly  vigilant  as  regards  to  the  origin  of certain minerals and materials, for which risk mapping is also carried out.\n\nIn  the  light  of  Groupe  Renault's  commitment  to  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms, and particularly the fight against child labor in  its  supply  chains  of  minerals  and  materials  from  high-risk countries,  Groupe  Renault  works  in  priority  since  2017  with  the cobalt sector, as this mineral is used in electric batteries.\n\nThe Group selected a specialist audit firm in this sector to fully map its  supply  chain  and  perform  on-site  audits  for  the  identified stakeholders.\n\n## Specific actions to mitigate risks and prevent claims\n\nIn  2019  this  specialist  firm  carried  out  17 site  audits  for  certain suppliers and subcontractors in the cobalt supply chain. Audits were conducted at each level of  the  supply  chain,  starting  with  cathode suppliers  and  even  down  to  some  small-scale  mines  in  the Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  (DRC).  No  critical  cases  of non-compliance  were  identified,  and  corrective  action  plans  are being  implemented.  In  2020,  the  monitoring  of  action  plans  by cathode suppliers and certain refiners continued.\n\nRenault  has  been  a  member  of  the  Responsible  Mineral  Initiative (RMI)  since  2017.  The  RMI's  objective  is  to  strive  to  implement  a responsible supply chain for minerals and materials originating from Conflict  Affected  and  High-Risk  Areas  (CAHRAs).  RMI  brings together  the  major  players  of  the  electronics  and  automotive industries. It meets monthly and the minutes of these meetings are sent to all of its members. In 2020, cobalt has been once again our main priority throughout this initiative.\n\nIn 2020, Groupe Renault also joined the Child Labour Platform (CLP) of  the  ILO  (International  Labour  Organization).  The  Child  Labour Platform  aims  to  identify  obstacles  to  the  implementation  of  ILO Conventions in production lines and in neighboring communities, to develop  practical  ways  to  overcome  these  obstacles  and  to coordinate collective action with its members and other partners.\n\n## Purchasing contribution 2.5.2.9 to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the supply chain\n\nThrough the scope of its activities, the purchasing department (APO) is  a  major  player  in  helping  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in Groupe Renault's supply chain.\n\nAPO is involved in each of the stages, whether for the purchase of parts and raw materials, transport services for parts or vehicles and energy.\n\nIn  2020,  Groupe  Renault  defined  the  terms  of  a  program  to strengthen  the  integration  of  climate  change  challenges  into purchasing decisions.\n\n## A local integration strategy /uni00A0EFPD14a/uni00A0 2.5.2.10\n\nLocal integration is a major element of Groupe Renault's purchasing policy  because  it  can  improve  the  Group's  competitiveness,  reduce its exposure  to  monetary  fluctuations  and  contribute  to  the development of the regions where it is located.\n\nA local approach has numerous advantages leading to the reduction of costs. Thus, the local purchasing of parts can reduce transport and customs costs. This proximity also enables the Company to be more responsive,  to  adapt  more  quickly  to  changes  in  demand  from  its customers and to participate in local development and notably the local employment pool.\n\nTo promote local integration, Groupe Renault has created dedicated teams, firstly in Russia, then in Brazil and India. These teams, from purchasing, engineering, sales costs and logistics, launch local calls for tenders to purchase parts that until then were imported.\n\nThe localization rate is intrinsically connected with local regulations, currency exchange rates, the Group's industrial activity (launching of new projects) and may vary on a year-to-year basis.\n\nI",

It is supported by a local tax network in its mission.\n\nTax risk management is an integral part of the Group's overall risk management process.\n\nThe  Group's  Tax  Department  ensures  the  distribution  of  tax compliance standards within the Group (Automotive, AVTOVAZ and RCI), through internal communication channels.\n\nThe  Group  Tax  department  takes  a  responsible  approach  to managing  and  controlling  tax  matters,  based  on  the  relevant documentation and rigorous internal control of tax processes.\n\n## Cybersecurity and data protection 2.5.4\n\n## Cybersecurity 2.5.4.1\n\nTo manage risks and protect its data, Groupe Renault has set up an organization/governance  and  operational  measures  in  matters  of cybersecurity.  The  details  of  these  measures  are  shown  in  chapter 1.5.2 - Risks related to cross-group functions.\n\n## Data protection 2.5.4.2\n\nCompliance with personal data protection rules opens up a golden opportunity  to  strengthen  trust  between  Renault  s.a.s.  and  its stakeholders  (shareholders,  customers,  suppliers  and  employees). Trust is a value in which Renault s.a.s. believes particularly strongly, and personal data protection is one of the main ethical bases for our actions.\n\nGiven this commitment, in 2011, Renault designated a data-protection  correspondent  with  an  extended  scope  to  the French  data protection  authority  (CNIL).  Subsequently,  the  Group implemented legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance  with  French  data  protection  law  no. 78-17  dated January 6,  1978.  More  recently,  in  May 2018,  Renault  appointed  a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since June 2019, this has been a full-time role performed by a dedicated expert.\n\nI\n\nThe  Data  Protection  Officer  relies  on  a  network  of  GDPR  officers (known  as  Privacy  Ambassadors)  in  each  department,  who  are responsible for managing  the  compliance  of  personal  data processing  within  their  own  scopes.  A  legal  team  dedicated  to  the protection  of  personal  data  has  also  been  created,  together  with multi-disciplinary working groups bringing together all of Renault's functional departments.\n\nGiven the prospect of its digital transformation, developments to its connectivity and data-related activities (mobility services, connected vehicles  and  autonomous  vehicles)  in  order  to  comply  with  the general data protection regulation (GDPR), Groupe Renault launched a  program  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  an  organization, governance,  processes  and  tools  intended  to  protect  the  personal data of its employees and its customers/users.\n\nRenault  is  also  involved  in  working  groups  led  by  the  Comit\u00e9  des Constructeurs  Fran\u00e7ais  d'Automobiles  (CCFA)  and  by  the  European Automobile  Manufacturers'  Association,  on  the  specific  topic  of connected services.\n\nGroupe Renault takes  all  necessary  precautions  in  order  to  ensure that personal data is processed safely an in line with regulations.",

Renault uses the GaBi LCA (PE International) software and databases.\n\nThe  life-cycle  inventory  describes  all  the  elements  that  are  taken into account in the life-cycle assessment of a vehicle. These data are related to life-cycle stages, from the vehicle's manufacturing to its recycling, and including its usage phase:\n\n- raw  materials  and  manufacturing:  thanks  to  Renault's  internal P databases, each vehicle is described in terms of the raw materials it contains. These data, coupled with those in the GaBi database, allow all phases of the extraction and processing of raw materials to be incorporated in the inventory. The data on the manufacturing  of  vehicles  integrated  in  the  life-cycle  inventory comes from the annual environmental reporting for the industrial sites,  which  is  subjected  to  verification  by  an  Independent  Third Party;\n- usage and maintenance phase: the usage phase is calculated over P 10 years and  150,000km.  The  certified  emissions  for  the regulatory  cycle  are  taken  into  consideration.  Moreover,  the impacts associated with the vehicles' energy consumption (diesel, gasoline or electricity) are calculated from 'well to wheel', i.e. , the emissions  associated  with  the  production  and  transport  of  the energy  used  are  taken  into  account.  In  the  usage  phase,  the maintenance  activities  performed  throughout  the  life  of  the vehicle (tire changes, oil changes, brake fluid, etc. ) are taken into account;\n- end-of-life: emissions related to recycling processes are accounted P for.  The  recycling  of  materials  from  vehicles  enables  the  use  of virgin  material  and  associated  emissions  to  be  avoided.  The emissions  avoided  in  this  way  are  deducted  from  the  carbon footprint.\n\nAll potential impacts are calculated using the GaBi software.\n\nI\n\n## Carbon footprint B.\n\nThe purpose of determining Renault's carbon footprint is to measure and  propel  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  Groupe Renault.  The  following  methodologies  have  accordingly  been chosen:\n\n- the carbon footprint is compared to the number of vehicles sold; P\n- in the event of sales or acquisitions, the reference value (2010) is P corrected to take into account or subtract the site's emissions at that  date  in  order  to  measure  changes  in  the  Group's  carbon footprint in relation to 2010 on a comparable scope of activity;\n- if  there  is  an  update  to  the  model  in  the  GaBi  tool  used  to P calculate  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated  with  the materials  and  parts  purchased  (see  above),  the  2010  reference value is recalculated with the new database in order to measure the  changes  to  the  indicator  on  a  comparable  basis.  This happened  in  2015  and  2018.  In  addition,  to  factor  in  the environmental performance of suppliers between model updates in  the  GaBi tool, a carbon performance factor of -2% per year is applied;\n- the  carbon  footprint  is  calculated  for  a  constant  scope  of P emissions.  When  the  scope  is  amended,  the  2010  benchmark value is recalculated. In 2017, the calculation scope was extended to include: RRG, vehicles bought from and sold to partners, filling of  air  conditioning  systems  (for  premises  and  vehicles),  vehicle and  engine  testing  and  indirect  emissions  linked  to  purchased thermal  energy.  In  2018  two  foundries  were  integrated  into  the scope without recalculating the 2010 benchmark value, this being a  capacity  extension rather than an integration of a pre-existing entity.  In  2020,  vehicle  air  conditioning  maintenance  was  taken into account, with a recalculation of the 2010 reference value. The conversion factors between certification cycles were also updated.\n\nThe  carbon  footprint  for  Renault  does  not  include  a  prospective dimension.  The  value  retained  for  the  carbon  intensity  of  fuel  and industrial processes is that of the vehicle release year and does not vary during the life-cycle of the vehicle (10 years, 150,000km).",

For  example,  the  recycling  of  scrap  metal  from  the  Group's production  sites  is  only  recognized  when  it  is  possible  to  ensure traceability within the automotive sector.\n\nThis indicator only takes into account the added value generated by initiatives  taken  as  a  result  of  intervention  by  Renault  or  its subsidiary  Renault  Environnement,  consistent  with  its  purpose  of measuring  the  Group's  performance.  This  means  that  metals recycled by the Group's suppliers of sheet metal or metal parts are not counted (even if they would contribute significantly to the result) insofar as it is on the own initiative of those suppliers.\n\nThe  indicator  is  calculated  on  a  like-for-like  basis:  when  new activities are included, the baseline value (2016) is recalculated.\n\nThe contributions taken into account are summarized in the table below.\n\n## CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARY RENAULT ENVIRONNEMENT\n\n|

        "page_content": "## Methodological comments on the 2.6.1.2 table 'Site environmental indicators in 2020'\n\nReporting  for  the  environmental  indicators  was  conducted  in accordance with the stipulations of the 2019 Environmental Protocol for  Renault  Sites.  The  following  is  an  explanation  of  the  main methodological choices of the Protocol. This Protocol is available on request from Environment department of the Group's HSE division.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe  scope  of  the  reported  data  covers  the  industrial  subsidiaries (body  assembly,  final  assembly,  powertrain  and  foundry)  and  the support  sites  (product  and  process  design,  logistics)  in  the  Groupe Renault  financial  scope  of  consolidation.  AVTOVAZ's  reporting  is currently under construction and in 2020 covers:\n\n- for the Izhevsk site, all indicators except recycled waste; P\n- for  the  Togliatti  site,  all  indicators  except  those  related  to P wastewater  discharges,  recycled  waste  and  VOC  emissions excluding the main paint line.\n\nThe  scope  covered  by  the  priority  indicators  represents  between 85% and 89% of the vehicles produced by the Group in 2020.\n\nN.B. The Renault Sport site in Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon, which produces engines exclusively for competition vehicles (Formula 1) is excluded from the environmental reporting scope.\n\nImpacts of suppliers or third parties present on site are not included, with the exception of the sites listed under the 'Site environmental indicators in 2020' table. All impacts arising from employee catering facilities,  CSR  activities  and  social  partner  activities  are  included  in the data for the Renault sites.\n\nThe data for  sites  included  in  the  scope  of  reporting  in  year  Y  are presented for information and are consolidated with those of other sites only from year Y+1.\n\nData from Ga\u00efa is taken into account at sites where Ga\u00efa operates, except the Choisy-le-Roy and Flins sites (France), where Ga\u00efa waste is recorded separately.\n\nThe drinking water production and Davidesti waste storage activity at  the  Pitesti  site  (Dacia)  were  removed  from  the  reporting  scope. The data is shown for information purposes.\n\n## Procedures for controlling and consolidating data\n\nExperts from the Group Health, Safety, Environment and Ergonomics department check the consistency of data at each site. These checks include a comparison with data from previous years and an analysis of the impact of events occurring on site during the year.\n\nThe  environmental  data  presented  in  the  Universal  registration document have also been subjected to external verification  by  the independent third party, KPMG. Their conclusions are set out in the report in section 2.6.5.\n\nAPPENDICES\n\n## Water consumption\n\nWater consumption is expressed in thousands of cubic meters (m 3 ).\n\nMeasured volumes include water obtained by pumping (underground and surface water) and/or external networks (drinking water,  industrial  water).  Collected  rainwater  (Giheung,  Guyancourt, Flins, Maubeuge and Medellin) is also included.\n\n## Liquid discharges\n\nData  on  pollutant  flows  are  based  on  measurements  of  effluents after they have been treated in the Group's plants and before they are  discharged  to  the  outside.  Discharges  from  some  plants  may subsequently  be  treated  in  municipal  treatment  plants  (see  plant codes).\n\nUnder  the  Reporting  Protocol,  the  frequency  of  discharge  analysis must comply with the regulations applicable to the Renault sites.\n\nThe  quantity  of  SS  represents  the  flow  of  suspended  solids discharged, expressed in metric tons per year.\n\nThe quantity of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) represents the flow of organic pollutants discharged. This quantity is expressed in metric tons per year.\n\nThe  toxic  metals  quantity  represents  the  sum  of  the  flow  of  toxic metals discharged, weighted by a toxicity coefficient. This quantity, expressed in metric tons per year, is calculated as follows:\n\nToxic metals =\n\n5 flows (Ni+Cu) +10 flows (Pb+As) +1 flow (Cr+Zn) +50 flows (Hg+Cd).\n\nThe data presented only take into account the discharges relating to metals, Suspended Solids (SS) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), for which concentration and flow must be measured by law, and the discharges  from  the  plants  in  Bursa  (Turkey),  Curitiba  (Brazil), Moscow  (Russia),  Santa  Isabel  de  Cordoba  (Argentina)  and Casablanca  (Morocco),  for  which  voluntary  controls  are  taken  into account in light of the significant contribution of these discharges to the Group's impacts.\n\nFor sites that are not subject to a regulatory requirement to measure pollutant  flows  or  to  consolidated  voluntary  controls  at  the  Group level, the reported value is noted as 'NC'. Black water discharges, for which  there  is  no  regulatory  measurement  and/or  reporting obligation,  are  not  included  in  the  water  discharges.  This  concerns 37%  of  manufacturing  sites  (one  of  which  is  covered  in  a  partial statement) and 69% of engineering, logistics and support sites.\n\nThe  Moscow,  Santa  Isabel  de  Cordoba,  Curitiba,  Casablanca (SOMACA) and Batilly (Sovab) sites are subject to specific regulatory requirements,  and  receive  an  exemption  on  the  calculation methodology of the specific flows.\n\n## Air emissions\n\nThe  atmospheric  emissions  of  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOC) included in the data are the emissions produced when bodywork is painted (body assembly plants). The application of paint on bumpers and on parts and accessories is not taken into account.\n\nThe  indicator  shown  corresponds  to  the  metric  tons  of  VOC emissions  and  the  ratio  of  VOC  emissions  per  square  meters  of painted  vehicle  surface.  The  consolidated  ratio  for  the  Group corresponds  to  the  total  VOC  emissions  generated  by  the  body assembly plants divided by the total of the painted surfaces.\n\n02",

Following  this  inventory,  Renault  modified  its  guidelines  to  better reflect the total emissions of Groupe Renault and to comply with the recommendations  of  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol  (GHG  Protocol) and the French protocol developed by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EPE).\n\nEmissions from the following sources were included:\n\n- combustion  of  fossil  energies  transported  to  the  site  and  those P transformed by the site for third parties;\n- coolant  fill-up  of  the  air  conditioning  systems  fitted  in  vehicles P produced by the plant. Only HFC 134a fill-up is taken into account. It  is  not  considered  pertinent  to  declare  HFO1234yf  use  under French  legislation  (Article R. 543-75  of  the  French  Environment Code  excludes  this  gas  from  coolant  fluids)  and  in  view  of  its negligible impact on GHG emissions;\n- fuel consumption during testing of engines, gearboxes endurance P vehicles and tests on test benches;\n- forklift trucks using compressed natural gas or propane; P\n- fuel  consumption  relating  to  Renault's  company  vehicles  (taxi P pools, shuttles, service vehicles, handling equipment, etc. );\n- coolant  leaks  from  fixed  air  conditioning  systems  and  processes P with a nominal load in excess of 5 teq CO2.\n\nThese  emissions  make  up  more  than  95%  of  the  GHG  direct emissions produced by Groupe Renault.\n\nThe  following  emission  sources  have  been  excluded  from  the reporting  scope,  since  the  corresponding  emissions  are  not significant (less than 1% of total GHG direct emissions):\n\n- solvent incineration; P\n- tests on vehicles leaving the assembly line (test benches). P\n\nIt  is  not  yet  possible  to  correctly  assess  certain  emissions,  so  the following are not included in the reporting scope:\n\n- emissions  associated  with  transport  on  sites  not  listed  above P among the emissions counted (particularly the delivery by a road haulier external to Groupe Renault);\n- fugitive emissions occurring when tanks of coolant (for vehicle air P conditioning systems) are filled and emptied;\n- emissions linked to SF6-type circuit breaker installations. P\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) indirect discharges are related to purchased electricity,  steam  and hot water. The emission factors used for the 2020 reporting are:\n\nI\n\n- for  electricity,  those  published  by  the  IEA  (International  Energy P Agency)  in  its  CO2  Emissions  from  Fuel  Combustion  2020 publication;\n- for  steam  and  hot  water,  data  calculated  on  the  basis  of P information provided by suppliers.\n\nCertain  emissions  from  the  foundry  activity  are  not  reported. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the foundries are however taken into account.\n\nEmissions  factors  used  in  the  calculations  of  SO2,  NOx  and  GHG emissions are taken from the CITEPA's OMINEA National Inventory Report  (updated  in  March  2020)  and  are  consistent  with  the recommendations  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThe emission factor from fixed combustion installations of low-NOx natural  gas  burners  was  calculated  in  2011,  based  on  an  internal study  of  88%  of  sites  in  the  scope  having  low-NOx  burners.  The factor  thus  obtained  (0.0266kg/MWh  NCV)  is  the  average  of  the factors  obtained  at  each  site  weighted  by  the  power  of  the installations.\n\n## Waste\n\nThe waste reported is the waste that leaves the site's geographical scope; the quantities are expressed in metric tons.\n\nThe waste reported includes hazardous waste (HW), non-hazardous waste (NHW), and construction site waste.\n\nFor  the  sake  of  clarity,  non-hazardous  waste  is  presented  in  two sub-categories:\n\n- metallic waste from production processes (scrap metals, P machining chips, etc. );\n- non-metallic waste (mixed ordinary waste, for example). P\n\nConstruction  waste  from  Renault  sites  is  not  reported  unless  a contractual clause explicitly states that the construction company is not responsible for it.\n\n## Energy Consumption\n\nThis  metric  represents  the  quantity  of  gas,  heating  oil,  LPG (excluding vehicles), biomass, steam, hot water, electricity  and solar thermal energy consumed at Renault sites, expressed in MWh LHV (Lower Heating Value). However, the data indicated does not include the propane used by forklift trucks or the fuel consumed by the site (engine and gearbox testing, company vehicles).\n\nThe  primary  or  converted  energy  supplied  to  third  parties  is  not included.  The  purpose  of  the  energy  consumption  indicators  is  to reflect  the  energy  performance  of  the  Group's  manufacturing processes.\n\nThe  lower  heating  values  (LHV)  are  consistent  with  CITEPA's OMINEA National Inventory report (updated in March 2020) and the Order of October 31, 2012 on the verification and quantification of emissions declared within the GHG Emissions Trading Scheme, with the  exception  of  LHV  from  natural  gas  in  Spanish  plants  (Spanish national  inventory  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  1990-2018,  2020 edition). The LHVs are consistent with the emissions reported in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.",

This questionnaire includes P a number of indicators: headcount by gender and age, number of recruitment  and  redundancies,  absenteeism  rate,  number  and subjects  of  major  collective  agreements  signed  during  the  year, number  of  employees  covered  by  a  collective  bargaining agreement and selected at corporate level from the most relevant agreements, total cumulative training hours in the year, training access rate, average training rate per employee and percentage of disabled  employees.  Each  indicator  has  a  specific  definition  and calculation  method  that  is  shared  with  the  Regions.  This questionnaire also enables data to be cross-referenced with last year's figures to monitor developments;\n- for  the  data  specific  to  health  and  safety  (number  of  workplace P accidents,  commuting  accidents  and  occupational  illnesses),  a reporting process with monthly consolidation is put in place with the  Group  entities.  Each  month,  the  data  is  checked  at  the corporate level, using the protocol, to ensure the quality of their classification. A  digital  reporting  tool  is  being  rolled  out, contributing to improving the reliability of data.\n\nA continuous improvement process for these collection methods is in place,  taking  into  account  the  recommendations  of  the  statutory auditors.\n\n## Definitions and calculation methods for labor-related indicators\n\nTotal  workforce: number  of  employees  holding  an  employment contract with the entity (permanent or fixed-term). Every employee on the payroll is counted as 'one' regardless of his or her contractual working  time  (or  activity  rate).  All  employees  on  the  payroll  are counted, even if they are sent to another entity.\n\nAverage  Group  workforce = (Group  workforce  at  December 31  of the previous year + Group workforce at December 31 of the current year)/2.\n\nRegion average workforce = (Region workforce at December 31 of the  previous  year  +  Region  workforce  at  December 31  of  current year)/2.\n\nRegion workforce as of December 31 is equal to end-December total workforce for all Regions except Europe. For the Europe Region, the regional  workforce  is  equal  to  end-of-month  total  workforce excluding employees under exemption of activity in the framework of the CAP 2020 Agreement in France.\n\nAverage active workforce: the average active workforce is equal to the  total  registered  workforce  for  the  entity  concerned,  excluding 'inactive'  employees.  The  active  workforce  is  measured  every month.  The  average  active  workforce  is  equal  to  the  average calculated over 12 months.\n\n'Inactive': persons  appearing  in  the  entity's  workforce  but physically  absent  from  the  entity  for  a  long  period  and  paid  only partially  or  not  at  all.  This  category  consists  mainly  of:  unworked notice periods, leave of absence unpaid for various reasons including long-term  parental  leave,  sabbatical  leave,  end  of  professional career leave including exemptions from activity in France, leave for business  creation,  parental  educational  leave,  absence  due  to long-term illness or accident after using up the amount of leave paid by the Company (amount linked to the current work absence), and military service. Persons on sick leave (excluding long-term) and on maternity  or  paternity  leave  are  not  considered  as  'inactive' employees.\n\nNumber of Group redundancies : termination of permanent contract or early termination of fixed-term contract by the employer for one or  more  reasons  that  may  or  may  not  relate  personally  to  the employee  in  question,  and  which  may  be  either  collective  or individual. Conventional  severance,  voluntary  departure  plans, non-continuation at the end of a trial period, and abandonment of post are not considered as redundancy.\n\nNumber of Group recruitments: hiring  on permanent contract and fixed-term contracts.\n\nTop  governing  bodies: positions  comprising  members  of  the  BoM (Board of  Management), CMC (Corporate Management Committee) and BMC (Brand Management Committee).\n\nSenior Management Positions: positions reaching a certain level of responsibility according to the Korn Ferry job evaluation methodology.  This  represents  4,000  positions,  within  the  scope deployed  in  the  People@Renault  tool  (excluding  AVTOVAZ  and RRG).\n\nManagement  Positions: Positions of responsibility: positions reaching a certain level of responsibility according to the Korn Ferry job  evaluation  methodology.  This  represents  10%  of  the  Group's positions  in  the  scope  defined  in  the  People@Renault  tool (excluding AVTOVAZ and RRG), i.e. 11,000 positions.\n\nNumber of hours of training: cumulative number of training hours delivered, whether the training is provided on site by internal/external  trainers,  outside  the  company  by  a  training organization,  or  followed  remotely.  This  indicator  measures  the overall training effort.\n\nTraining  access  rate: number  of  employees  trained  at  least  once during  the  year  who  are  still  with  the  Company  at  the  end  of  the year, as a percentage of the active workforce at year-end.\n\nI\n\nAPPENDICES\n\n02",

It  should  be  noted  however,  that  it  is  difficult  to  prepare  statistics that accurately reflect the number of disabled employees, given the different regulations and the lack of legal reporting requirements in numerous countries.\n\nAbsenteeism  (absence  due  to  unforeseen  circumstances): the absenteeism rate is expressed as a percentage and is calculated on the basis of the average active workforce (permanent + fixed-term contracts) and the theoretical yearly number of working days.\n\nThe  number  of  days  of  absence  is  expressed  in  working  days, excluding  short-time  working,  layoffs,  strikes,  training  and  leave (including maternity and paternity leave).\n\nFormula:  number  of  absence  days  per  year/(active  workforce  x number of theoretical days per year) x 100.\n\nThe  choice  of  assumptions  for  the  calculation  of  theoretical  days number  is  left  up  to  the  entities,  since  local  factors  may  result  in minor differences.\n\nAll  definitions  of health  and  safety  indicators were  updated  on January 1, 2017.\n\nThe FR0, FR1 and FR2 rates correspond to the incident rates divided by 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\nFor example:\n\nFR0 =\n\nx 1,000,000\n\nNumber of incidents requiring first aid\n\nNumber of hours worked\n\nAccidents  of  temporary  workers  are  included  in  the  FR1  and  FR2 indicators from 2018.\n\nI\n\nFR0: frequency of workplace accidents requiring first aid for Renault and temporary employees.\n\nFR1: frequency  rate  of  workplace  accidents  requiring  more significant  medical  treatment  than  first  aid  for  Renault  and temporary  employees.  This  rate  corresponds  to  a  defined  list  of injuries on which Groupe Renault intends to concentrate.\n\nFR2: frequency rate of workplace accidents with sick leave involving Renault  and  temporary  employees  (several  additional  exclusions compared with F2).\n\nF2  rate: frequency  rate  of  workplace  accidents  with  lost  time  = (number of accidents with lost time on first payment/hours worked) x 1,000,000\n\nFirst payment: means that this resulted in compensation in the form of a first payment of a daily allowance or a first payment of capital or an annuity.\n\nSeverity rate G1: [number of days of sick leave during the year due to  workplace  accidents  that  year  or  in  previous  years  -  number  of days of sick leave due to accidents that were contested or where a dispute  was  won]  x  1,000/number  of  hours  of  exposure  to occupational risks during the year.\n\nOccupational illnesses: rate of occupational illnesses contracted by Renault employees following prolonged exposure to an occupational risk (noise, chemicals, posture, etc. ), reported as such to an external body  if  the  regulations  in  force  in  the  country  so  provide.  Rate  of reported  occupational  illness  per  1,000 employees  to  end-2016. Occupational illness rate reported per million hours of exposure to occupational risks from 2017 onwards. This rate includes occupational illnesses, reported with or without sick leave.\n\nAccidents  on  public  roads: accidents  involving  Renault  employees on public roads while commuting to work or traveling on business.",

For  example,  donating  a  vehicle  for  transporting children to school would be classified under 'education';\n- actions stemming from Renault s.a.s philanthropy (see 2.4.4.2).

They  identify  a  minimum  set  of  sustainable  development  themes and  associated  indicators  that  a  company  characteristic  of  an industry segment should publish because of their

This rates the Company not only on its financial performance but also on its attitude toward the environment,  respect  for  social  values,  societal  commitment  and corporate governance.\n\nEach  area  analyzed  produces  a  rating  based  on  different  criteria (transparency,  innovation,  communication, etc. )  and  is  weighted  to obtain a final  rating.  This  serves  as  a  reference  for  fund  managers and investors who wish to invest in companies which are successful in terms of social responsibility. Some of these rating agencies have developed, most of the time in partnership with providers of equity indexes, some specific indexes composed of the top-rated companies for environmental, social or governance (ESG) aspects.\n\nGroupe  Renault  is  evaluated  each  year  by  the  main  international extra-financial  rating  agencies  on  the  basis  of  its  public  and declarative information. These agencies generally reserve access to the results of their assessments for their  own clients.\n\n## Extra-financial performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe CDP (formerly  the  carbon  disclosure  project), founded  in  2000,  is  tasked  by  a  group  of institutional  investors  to  enhance  understanding\n\nof the impacts of climate change on the value of the assets managed by  its  signatories.  It  is  an  independent  not-for-profit  organization which  collates  and  maintains  a  large  database  relating  to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSince  2002,  the  CDP  has  sent  companies  annual  requests  for information  in  a  standard  format  about  their  greenhouse  gas emissions  and  policies  on  climate  change.  The  CDP  includes,  in particular, members of the FT500 (the 500 largest companies in the world by market capitalization).\n\n2020  results: having  submitted  its  responses  to  the  CDP  Climate Change questionnaire, Groupe Renault obtained an A-rating, which keeps it in the 'Leadership' category.

We conducted some fifteen interviews  with  the  people  responsible  for  preparing  the  Statement,  representing  in  particular  the  social  relations,  ethics  and  compliance, human resources, health and safety, environment and purchasing departments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nKey performance indicators on themes identified as the main risks, i.e. the quantities of toxic metals in liquid effluents and non-recycled waste, are communicated respectively on the Group perimeter including AVTOVAZ (excluding the Togliatti plant), representing 89% of the vehicles produced by the Group, and on the Group perimeter excluding AVTOVAZ, representing 85% of the vehicles produced by the Group.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, except for the effect of the matter described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Extra-Financial Performance Declaration is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Comment\n\nWithout modifying our conclusion and in accordance with article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following comment:\n\n- volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions are reported on a perimeter that increased compared to the previous year, which corresponds to P the  Group  including  AVTOVAZ (except for  two  production  lines  at  the  Togliatti  plant),  representing  94%  of  the  vehicles  produced  by  the Group.\n\n## Reasonable assurance report on a selection of non-financial information\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nWith regard to the information selected by the entity presented in Appendix and identified with the symbol \u221a in chapter 'Groupe Renault: A company that acts responsibly', we conducted the same procedures as those described in the paragraph 'Nature and scope of our work' (for the most important extra-financial information). However, these procedures were more in-depth, particularly regarding the number of tests.\n\nConsequently, the selected sample represents between 50% and 88% of the information identified with the symbol \u221a.\n\nWe believe that these procedures enable us to express reasonable assurance regarding the information selected by the entity and identified with the symbol \u221a.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  information  selected  by  the  entity  and  identified  with  the  symbol  \u221a  in  chapter  'Groupe  Renault:  A  company  that  acts responsibly' has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, on February 24, 2021\n\nKPMG\u00a0S.A.\n\nAnne Garans\n\nPartner Sustainability Services\n\nBertrand Pruvost\n\nPartner\n\nI",

(ii)/uni00A0\n\nThis  report  was  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  during  its meeting held on February 18, 2021.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article L. 22-10-10  4\u00b0  of  the  French Commercial Code, the Company declares that it has opted to refer to the  AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate  Governance  Code  of  listed  companies (hereinafter, the ' AFEP-MEDEF Code '). The potential recommendations from this code which have not been followed are shown  in  a  section  (see  chapter 3.1.8  of  the  Universal  registration document).\n\nThe  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  is  available  for  consultation  on  the Company's website.\n\n## COMPOSITION, PREPARATION 3.1 AND/uni00A0ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD OF/uni00A0DIRECTORS\n\nThis  chapter  describes  the  method  for  managing  and  directing Renault SA as a listed company and the parent company of Groupe Renault. This management method is also applicable to Renault s.a.s, a subsidiary of Renault SA and the umbrella company for Groupe Renault's automotive and financial businesses.\n\n## Governance structure 3.1.1\n\n## Evolution of the mode of governance\n\nDuring  its  meeting  of  January 24,  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on the recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee, decided to separate the offices of Chairman of the Board of  Directors  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.  The  Board  of  Directors considers that this governance structure is appropriate to Renault's current challenges. It enables the Company to benefit from both the Chairman's  stature  and  expertise  in  corporate  governance  and  the managerial background and industrial and automotive expertise of the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  in  charge  of  the  management  and  the implementation of the Company's mid-term plan.\n\nThe office  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  was  entrusted  to Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard  following  his  appointment  as  a Director (1) pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article L. 225-17  par. 3  of the  French  Commercial  Code.  On  this  occasion,  the  office  of  Chief Executive Officer had been entrusted to Mr. Thierry Bollor\u00e9.\n\nThe operating principles and missions of the Board of Directors are described in the Board Charter, which is available in full on Groupe Renault's  website.  The  main  contents  of  the  Board  Charter  are reproduced below.\n\nDuring  its  meeting  of  October 11,  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors decided to end Mr. Thierry Bollor\u00e9's term of office as Chief Executive Officer of Renault SA and Chairman of Renault s.a.s with immediate effect. The Board of Directors has also decided to appoint Ms Clotilde Delbos as Chief Executive Officer of Renault SA for an interim period, until a process is completed to appoint a new Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFollowing  the  selection  process  conducted  by  the  Governance  and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on January 28,  2020,  decided  to  appoint  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  as  Chief Executive  Officer  of  Renault SA  and  Chairman  of  Renault  s.a.s, effective July 1, 2020.\n\nThe Board of Directors was of the opinion that Mr. Luca de Meo, due to his background, experience and success in his previous functions, possesses  all  of  the  qualities  required  to  contribute  to  the  growth and transformation of Groupe Renault in all its dimensions.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors delivered a favorable opinion on the  appointment  of  Ms.  Clotilde  Delbos  as  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer of Renault S.A. from July 1, 2020.\n\nThis appointment was ratified by the Annual General Meeting held on June 12, 2019.

It examines any changes to be made to these orientations and gives its opinion before any major decision that may be deemed not to be consistent with the Company's strategy.\n\nIn addition, the Board Charter limits the powers of the Chief Executive Officer as follows:\n\n## Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must obtain the authorization of the Board of Directors for any external growth transaction and any acquisition  or  disposal  of  any  ownership  in  any  company, whether  existing  or  to  be  created,  where  the  amount  exceeds \u20ac250 million.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer's obligation to hold shares\n\nPursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the Board of Directors decided at its meeting on July 29, 2020, to set the minimum  number  of  registered  shares  to  be  held  by  the  Chief Executive Officer until the end of his term of office at 5,000 shares.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must inform the Board of Directors of any external growth transaction and any acquisition or disposal of  any  ownership  in  any  company,  whether  existing  or  to  be created, where the amount exceeds \u20ac60 million.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  shall  determine  every  year  the  total amount of sureties (cautions), endorsements (avals) or guarantees  (garanties),  which  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  may provide without requesting the Board's specific authorization.\n\noffice 25% of the shares resulting from the free allocation of shares (for more details on the retention obligation, see chapter 3.2.4.2 of the Universal registration document).\n\nThe  minimum  holding  requirement  ensures  that  a  Chief  Executive Officer who does not yet own shares resulting from free allocations of  shares  is  aligned  with  the  interests  of  shareholders  upon  taking office.\n\nThis  minimum  holding  obligation  complements  the  obligation  for the  Chief  Executive  Officer  to  retain  until  the  end  of  his  term  of\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors 3.1.2\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Annual General Meeting, with the exception of the Director designated by the French State pursuant to Article 4 of French Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 on corporate governance and equity transactions in companies with public shareholding and the Directors representing the employees.\n\nThe  term  of  office  for  Directors  is  four  years.  Pursuant  to  the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, these terms of office are staggered, to avoid them all ending and coming up for renewal at the same time.\n\n## Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the composition of the Board of/uni00A0Directors\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Board  aims  to  achieve  a  balance between professional experience, qualifications, independence and ethics, together with a balanced representation of  women and men and diversity in terms of recruitment consistent with the Group's international development.\n\nI\n\n## Procedure for appointing directors\n\nPursuant to the Company's articles of association and the legal and regulatory  provisions  applicable  to  it,  the  Board  of  Directors  is composed of:\n\n- 3 to 14 directors appointed by the Annual General Meeting P\n- Appointment of independent directors P\n\nIn case of a vacancy of one or more offices of the independent directors or when the Board has expressed its desire to expand or  change its membership, the Governance and Compensation Committee defines the profile sought with regard to its diversity policy  and  the  required  skills  that  have  been  identified,  in particular during the annual evaluation of the operation of the Board and its committees. The Governance and Compensation Committee  appoints  a  recruitment  firm  to  assist  it  with  the process of selecting future independent directors.\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  selects  the candidates with the help of the appointed recruitment firm on the  basis  of  criteria  relating  to  their  professional  experience, skills,  independence  and  ethics,  while  maintaining  a  gender balance between men and women and diversity in recruitment in accordance with the international dimension of the Group.",

This  director  is  appointed  by  the  Minister  for  the Economy.\n\n## 3 directors elected by the employees P\n\nPursuant to the Company's articles of association, three directors are elected directly by the employees of the French subsidiaries, divided  into  different  electorates.  One  seat  is  allocated  to  the 'Engineers - Executives and Similar' electorate and two seats to the 'Other Employees' electorate.\n\nThe candidates or candidate lists may be presented either by one or more representative organizations as defined by the applicable regulations, or by 100 voters.\n\nTo be considered eligible, candidates must have an employment contract with, and be actively employed by, the Company or one of its direct or indirect subsidiaries whose registered office is located in France for at least two years prior to the effective date of the term of office of the position for which the election is being held.\n\nCOMPOSITION, PREPARATION AND/uni00A0ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD OF/uni00A0DIRECTORS\n\nThe  number,  place  and  composition  of  the  polling  stations  are determined  by  the  Company's  establishments  and  subsidiaries concerned  thereby,  in  accordance  with  current  practices  for  the election of employee representatives.\n\n- One director representing employee shareholders P\n\nPursuant  to  the  Company's  articles  of  association,  a  member representing employee shareholders, and an alternate, are elected by the Ordinary General Meeting from among two full candidates and two alternate candidates nominated by employee shareholders.\n\nEach full  candidate  is  designated,  respectively,  along  with  his  or her alternate, by:\n\n- the  Supervisory  Boards  of  company  mutual  investment  funds P (FCPE) whose assets are composed of shares of the Company, in accordance with Article L. 214-165 of the French Monetary and Financial  Code,  and  whose  unit  holders  are  current  or  former employees  of  the  Company  or  of  an  affiliated  company  as defined  in  Article  L.  225-180  of  the  French  Commercial  Code; and\n- employees  of  the  Company  or  of  an  affiliated  company  as P defined  in  Article  L.  225-180  of  the  French  Commercial  Code who directly hold registered shares of the Company (i) following free  share  allocations  made  under  Article  L.  225-197-1  of  the French  Commercial  Code  and  authorized  by  a  decision  of  the Extraordinary General Meeting after August 7, 2015, (ii) within the  framework  of  the  employee  savings  plan  or  (iii)  acquired under  Article  31-2  of  French  Order  2014-948  of  August  20, 2014, on the governance and capital transactions of companies with  public  shareholding  and  Article  11  of  Law  No.  86-912  of August 6, 1986 on privatization, in the version applicable prior to the entry into force of the above-mentioned Order.\n\n## Diversity policy applied to the Board of/uni00A0Directors\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code, the Board, of Directors has defined a diversity policy based on its past practices.\n\n## Policy criteria\n\nThe composition of the Board of Directors seeks a balance between experience, competence,  independence  and  ethics,  all  while respecting  a  balanced  representation  of  women  and  men  and  a diversity of recruitment notably taking into account the international dimension of Groupe Renault. More precisely:\n\n- regarding the size of the Board of Directos, the number of Board P of Directors members must be such as to enable reconciliation of the  skills,  independence  and  specificities  of  Groupe  Renault's shareholding;\n- the  Board  of  Directors,  while  complying  at  least  with  legal P requirements  and  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code in terms of gender balance, considers that it benefits from being diverse in its composition (gender, nationality, culture);\n- in terms of skills, the Company  seeks above all the P complementarity of skills, profiles and experiences but also their relevance  to  the  Company's  strategy  and  to  the  challenges  it faces;\n\nI\n\n03",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nCOMPOSITION, PREPARATION AND/uni00A0ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD OF/uni00A0DIRECTORS\n\n- in  terms  of  seniority,  the  Company  seeks  a  balance  between P experience within the Board of Directors and progressive renewal of its composition;\n- the  Board  of  Directors  expects  a  high  level  of  commitment  and P ethics from each of its members.\n\n## Policy implementation\n\nTo  implement  this  diversity  policy,  the  Board  of  Directors  uses annual  evaluations  of  its  work  (for  more  details  on  the  Board's evaluation, see section 3.1.7 of the Universal registration document). The progressive and planned renewal of the terms of offices makes it  possible  to  anticipate  the  skills  to  be  renewed  or  to  evolve according  to  the  evolution  of  the  industry  and  of  the  markets  in which the Company operates.\n\nImplementation of the diversity policy in 2020:\n\n- the number of members of the Board of Directors was reduced to P 16 Directors.  This  number  remains  higher  than  the  average  for CAC 40 companies, but is explained by the level of representation of the employees and of the reference shareholders in accordance with  the  law,  the  articles  of  association  or  agreements  entered into  with  Nissan,  and  the  desire  to  ensure  the  presence  of  a majority of Independent Directors. As such, the independence rate of the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2020 was 66.7% (1) , up from the rate of 64.3% as of December 31, 2019;\n- the number of women on the Board of Directors at the close of the P 2020 Annual General Meeting stands at six, i.e. a feminization rate of 50.0% (1) , stable compared to the previous year. Moreover, three of the Board of Directors' four committees are chaired by women;\n- the  Strategy  Committee's  expertise  in  the  automotive  industry P and  in  executive  management  especially,  was  reinforced  by  the appointment  of    Ms  Annette  Winkler,  former  Vice-Chairman  of Daimler  AG  and  former  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Smart,  as Chairwoman of this Committee in February 2020;\n- the Board of Directors contains four different nationalities and a P majority  of  Directors  who  work  or  have  worked  abroad  or  in international groups;\n- three Directors representing employees  and  one  Director P representing  employee  shareholders  are  fully  associated  in  the work  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  committees.  These  four\n\nDirectors  benefit  from  in-house  training  provided  by  Groupe Renault's employees and training provided by external organizations. This training helps them to exercise their mandate to  the  fullest,  by  enabling  them  to  quickly  acquire  the  specific skills  of  a  company  director.  In  addition,  their  professional background  as  well  as  their  trade  union  activity  within  Groupe Renault gives them a solid knowledge of the Group's organization and activities;\n\n- the  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors P committees  are  part  of  the  continuing  implementation  of  this diversity policy of the Board of Directors.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  Directors  appointed  on  the  proposal  of Nissan  and  the  Directors  designated  by  the  French  State,  no contracts or agreements have been concluded with main shareholders,  clients,  suppliers,  or  other  parties  allowing  any  of these  persons  or  one  of  their  representatives  to  be  selected  as  a member  of  the  Board  or  other  Senior  Management  body  in  the Company, thus mitigating potential or actual conflicts of interest.\n\n## Diversity policy applied to Senior Management\n\nThe Board of Directors also oversees the deployment of the Group's diversity policy by Senior Management. In light of this, the Board of Directors  and  the  Ethics  and  CSR  Committee  annually  review  the Group's  diversity  and  inclusion  policy,  and  more  specifically  the policy  on  the  balanced  representation  of  women  and  men  on  the governing bodies.\n\nAs  of  December 31,  2020,  there  were  two  women  on  the  Board  of Management, including the Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAt its meeting on February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors, on the proposal  of  the  Senior  Management,  defined  the  following objectives for gender diversity within its governing bodies including the Board of Management, the Corporate Management Committee, and the Brand Management Committees. The percentage of women on the governing bodies should reach 30% before or in 2030, 35% before or in 2035 and 50% before or in 2050.\n\nFor further information on these objectives and the diversity policy applied  within  the  Group,  see  chapter 2.4.1.2  of  the  Universal registration document.\n\nExcluding the directors representing employees and the director representing employee shareholders.

In  this  respect,  the  directors  representing  the  employees  and employee  shareholders  do  not  personally  receive  compensation (which  is  passed  on  to  their  respective  trade  unions);  they  are therefore  not  required  to  hold  a  significant  number  of  shares  in the Company. Furthermore, legislation prohibits directors designated by the French State from personally owning shares.\n\nFor the retention obligation applicable to the Chief Executive Officer, see chapter 3.2 of the Universal registration document.\n\nI\n\n## No convictions 3.1.4.2\n\nTo the best of Groupe Renault's knowledge, none of the Company's current corporate officers has, over the last five years:\n\n- been convicted of fraud; P\n- taken  part  as  a  corporate  officer,  general  partner  or  founder  in P bankruptcy, receivership, or liquidation proceedings;\n- been  the  subject  of  any  charge  and/or  official  public  sanction P pronounced by a statutory or regulatory authority; or\n- been  prevented  by  a  court  from  acting  as  a  member  of  an P administrative, management, or supervisory body of an issuer, or from  taking  part  in  managing  or  conducting  the  business  of  an issuer.\n\n## No potential or actual conflicts 3.1.4.3 of/uni00A0interest\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  there  is  no  potential  or actual conflict of interest between any of the private interests of the Company directors and their duties towards the Company.\n\nThere  are  no  family  ties  between  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe corporate officers are not bound to the Company or any of its subsidiaries by a service contract providing for any form of benefit to be granted.",

Conversely,  the\n\nPursuant to the Board Charter, the Board of Directors refers to the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code to identify situations that may compromise the exercise of freedom of judgment by directors.\n\nIn any event, it is recalled that, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code,  every  director  is  under  an  obligation  to  inform  the  Board  of Directors of any potential conflict of interest situation and to refrain from attending the debate and from participating in the vote of the corresponding deliberation.\n\nEach  year,  the  Company  sends  a  questionnaire  to  each  director  in order  to  assess  his  or  her  independence  in  accordance  with  the criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  and  the  Board  of Directors  shall  also  review  the  classification  of  each  director  as independent in light of these same criteria.\n\nBoard  may  consider  that  a  director  who  does  not  meet  the aforementioned  criteria  should  nevertheless  be  considered  as independent.\n\nEach  year,  the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  shall discuss  for  each  director,  whether  such  director  should  be considered  as  independent,  and  the  independence  of  each director shall be examined on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Directors in light of the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.  Upon  appointment  of  a  new  director  or  renewal  of  the terms of office a director, the question of whether such director may be considered as independent should also be discussed.\n\nAs part of this review, the Governance and Compensation Committee and  the  Board  of  Directors  pays  particular  attention  to  the assessment of the materiality of the business relationships between the  directors  and  the  Company,  both  from  the  standpoint  of  the Group and of the relevant director. This assessment shall be carried out  in  the  light  of  qualitative  criteria,  such  as  the  nature  of  the business  relationships,  and  quantitative  criteria,  such  as  the amounts committed under these relationships.\n\nAccordingly,  to  qualify  as  independent,  the  Board  of  Directors ensures  that  there  were  no  significant  cash  flows  between  the Company  and  any  company  of  which  Company's  directors  are directors or Executive Officers, in particular by examining the share these companies account for in the Company's revenue.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  results  of  the  appraisal  of  the independence  of  directors  as  at  December 31,  2020  in  view  of  the criteria defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nI",

Independent        |\n\nAt its meeting of February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors examined the situation of Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard with regard to criterion no.  1  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  given  his  capacity  as  director  of Nissan and Chairman of Renault s.a.s. for the period from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020.\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code states that one of the criteria that the Board of  Directors  must  assess  to  possibly  exclude  someone  from  the status  of  independent  director  is  that  of  ' not  being  or  not  having been,  during  the  past  five  years,  an  employee,  executive  offer,  or director of a company that the company consolidates .' According to the AFEP-MEDEF Code implementation guide, this recommendation also applies when a director holds ' an office in a company in which the first company holds a non-controlling but significant stake, or in a sister company '.\n\nIt  is  recalled  that  Nissan  is  not  a  company  fully  consolidated  by Renault. Renault has significant influence over Nissan and therefore accounts for its interest in Nissan using the equity method (for more details on Renault's shareholding in Nissan, see note 12 in chapter 4.2.6.4 of the Universal registration document).\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and  Compensation  Committee,  held  that  the  appointment  of  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Renault  to  the  Board  of Directors  of  Nissan,  with  a  view  to  developing  and  strengthening cooperation  between  the  Boards  of  Directors  of  the  two  Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard's  freedom  of  judgement  and  independence  with  respect  to Renault.\n\nFurthermore,  should  such  a  situation  give  rise  to  any  conflict  of interest, the provisions of the Board Charter requiring the director in question to abstain from participating in the deliberations and votes of the Board of Directors would apply.\n\nI\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Governance  and  Committee  Committee,  considered  that  the performance  by  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard  of  the  duties  of Chairman of Renault s.a.s. from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020, was of an exceptional and purely temporary nature, during the time required for the Board of Directors to conduct the succession process for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  until  the  arrival  of  Mr.  Luca  de Meo  on  July  1,  2020.  The  Board  of  Directors  therefore  considered that this exceptional situation was not such as to call into question the independence of Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard at the end of this temporary term of office.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  February 18,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  also reviewed Mr. Pierre Fleuriot's situation with regard to criterion no. 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code in view of his appointment as director of Nissan.\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and  Compensation  Committee,  held  that  the  appointment  of  the Lead Independent Director of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan,  with  a  view  to  developing  and  strengthening  cooperation between  the  Boards  of  Directors  of  the  two  Alliance  partners  was not  such  as  to  call  into  question  Mr.  Pierre  Fleuriot's  freedom  of judgment and independence with respect to Renault.\n\nFurthermore,  should  such  a  situation  give  rise  to  any  conflict  of interest, the provisions of the Board Charter requiring the director in question to abstain from participating in the deliberations and votes of the Board of Directors would apply.\n\nFollowing  an  analysis  of  the  independence  of  the  Directors,  on February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  and  in  accordance with  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  drew  up  the following list of directors classified as independent  as  at December 31,  2020:  Catherine  Barba,  Miriem  Bensalah-Chaqroun,",

It  may  not include  any  senior  executive  officer.

The  conclusions  of  the  evaluation  were presented at the Governance and Compensation Committee meeting on February 15, 2021, and then at the Board of Directors meeting on February 18, 2021.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  questionnaire  and  of  the  interviews  with  the members of the Board was to evaluate the following themes:\n\n- the  composition,  role,  structure,  missions  and  operation  of  the P Board of Directors and its committees;\n- the  relationships  between  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Senior P Management; and\n- the  individual  contribution  of  each  director  and  collective P efficiency; and\n- follow-up on the points for improvement identified in the previous P evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation provided an opportunity to learn from the experience of  recent  events,  in  particular  since  the  last  external  evaluation  in 2017, and to reassess the ways in which the Board of Directors and its committees operate.\n\nIt highlighted the main changes that have occurred since 2017, i.e.:\n\n- the  new  governance  dynamic  implemented  in  2019,  when  the P offices  of  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  were  separated and the position of Lead Independent Director was maintained;\n\nI\n\n- the new collective dynamic created by the Chairman; P\n- the  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  Board,  with  a  reduced P number of members and new skills;\n- more in-depth and transparent discussions with Senior P Management; and\n- the Board's better consideration of CSR issues with the creation of P the Ethics and CSR Committee.\n\nThis evaluation identified recommendations and areas for improvement, such as:\n\n- developing the skills of the Board of Directors in order to enable it P to better address future topics (such as mobility, data, energy, new forms  of  propulsion,  etc.)  and  to  better  understand  strategic choices  to  be  done  by  the  Company  (such  as  product  strategy, electric / hydrogen / connected car, mobility technologies, etc .);\n- strengthening  the  skills  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in  financial P matters in order to establish a culture of profitability, optimal cash management, value creation for employees and shareholders;\n- better understanding, at the level of the Board of Directors, and P not  only  of  the  committees,  the  subjects  related  to  succession plans,  talents  and  diversity,  and  including  these  topics  on  the Board's agenda more regularly;\n- continuing and intensifying the appropriation of ESG topics by the P Board of Directors in addition to the work carried out by the Ethics and CSR Committee;\n- developing cross-functional approaches (i) between the Ethics and P CSR Committee and the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee on extra-financial performance issues and (ii) between the Ethics and CSR Committee and the Strategy Committee on the Group's ESG strategy;\n- understanding the strategy at the level of the Strategy Committee P in a global manner, not only through individual topics.",

In  its recommendations, the Governance and Compensation Committee takes into account the balance of the different components of the corporate officers' compensation.\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  the  non-executive  corporate  officer  is  based  on  a  fixed  compensation  and  does  not  include  any  variable  or exceptional cash compensation, nor compensation for directorship.\n\nThe compensation policy for the executive corporate officer is based on six simple, stable, transparent practices:\n\n| Closely linked to the Company's strategy 1                     | The compensation is closely linked to the implementation and results of the strategy. P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance-oriented 2                                         | The variable component of the executive officer's compensation represents a fraction of the total compensation  P that is consistent with market practice and ensures the interests of the executive officer are aligned with the  Company's performance. No variable compensation is granted in the event of under-performance. P                                                           |\n| Focus on long-term performance 3                               | A significant part of the executive officers' compensation depends on multi-year targets being achieved. P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Close alignment with shareholders 4                            | The number of performance shares allocated to the executive officer is expressed as an absolute number, rather  P than a percentage of the salary, so that upward and downward fluctuations in the share price affect the  corresponding total value. The executive officer must retain 25% of the shares vested pursuant to performance share plans until the end of  P his term of office. |\n| Competitive compensation 5                                     | Competition between corporate officers in the automotive market is intense. It is therefore of prime importance  P to ensure that the overall compensation of the executive officer is competitive compared to the practices of the  Company's peers, both CAC 40 companies and, more generally, comparable companies in the Automotive sector  in Europe and worldwide.                     |\n| Compensation which does not encourage  6 excessive risk-taking | The setting of performance targets, a sufficiently long evaluation period, and compensation capping allow  P excessive short-term risk-taking to be avoided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\nThese principles are established in compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code to which the Company refers pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nMore  generally,  the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  regularly  ensures  that  corporate  officers'  compensation  complies  with  all applicable laws and recommendations in terms of corporate governance.\n\nI\n\n03",

In addition  to  the  performance  criteria,  the  vesting  of  shares  is subject  to  a  presence  condition  of  three  years  following  the allocation of the performance shares.\n\nIn addition to these compensation components, the Chief Executive Officer  may  benefit  from  top-up  pension  schemes,  a  termination benefit in the event of dismissal and a non-compete agreement.\n\nPursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recommendations  of  the  French  Financial  Market  Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, AMF), the Chief Executive Officer does not hold an employment contract with the Company.",

The number of meetings scheduled has therefore been reached. Due to health restrictions, these meetings were held by videoconference, but they kept the momentum of the projects under consideration.

There was also a notable drop in the most serious accidents;\n- Car recycling rate : the car recycling rate target has been achieved; P\n- Gender pay-gap ratio: specific  actions  in  each  country  led  to  a  reduction  in  the P average  wage  gap  between  men  and  women.

For the 2020 financial year, these contributions to the insurer amounted to \u20ac20,307  for the benefit of the interim Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe contributions paid in this way do not benefit from any preferential tax or social security  regime.  For  this  reason,  the  interim  Chief  Executive  Officer  receives  a lump-sum indemnity equal to the amount of the contribution paid on her behalf to the  insurer.  Payment  of  this  indemnity  to  the  interim  Chief  Executive  Officer  is concomitant  to  the  payment  of  the  contribution  to  the  insurer  and  amounted  to \u20ac20,307 for the 2020 financial year.\n\nThe  contributions  and  lump-sum  indemnity  amounts  will  be  dependent  on  the Company's performance insofar as the calculation basis includes the variable portion of the compensation which is related to the Group's results.\n\nRenault s.a.s  employees,  in  April  2021,  after  taking  into  account the assessment of individual objectives;\n\n- long-term compensation allocated in respect of the 2020 financial P year in the form of 20,000 performance shares;\n- a  profit-sharing  payment  of  \u20ac30,393  in  respect  of  the  2019 P financial year paid in 2020;\n- other benefits (two company cars) valued at \u20ac8,637 in respect of P the 2020 financial year;\n- a non-compete agreement; and P\n- the benefit of a top-up collective pension scheme arranged for the P members  of  the  Groupe  Renault's  Executive  Committee  which includes  a  mandatory  defined-contribution  scheme  (Article 83) and an optional defined-contribution scheme (Article 82).\n\nThese  compensation  components  related  to  the  employment contract  and  not  the  corporate  office  are  not  submitted  for shareholders' appproval at the Annual General Meeting on April 23, 2021.\n\n## Compensation components of Ms/uni00A0Clotilde Delbos in respect of her employment contract with Renault s.a.s\n\nIt is recalled that when Ms Clotilde Delbos was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors decided to maintain her  employment  contract  as  Group  Chief  Financial  Officer  with Renault s.a.s and the associated compensation, given the exceptional circumstances and transitory nature of the situation.\n\nPursuant  to  her  employment  contract  with  Renault  s.a.s,  the compensation elements and benefits of any kind paid to Ms Delbos in respect of the 2020 financial year are as follows:\n\n- annual fixed compensation in respect of the 2020 financial year of P \u20ac556,293 paid in twelve monthly instalments;\n- variable  compensation  of  \u20ac476,232  allocated  in  respect  of  the P 2019  financial  year  and  paid  in  2020;  variable  compensation  in respect  of  the  2020  financial  year  will  be  determined,  as  for  all\n\n03",

The  Combined  General  Meeting  on  June 15, 2018 set the annual compensation amount to be divided among the directors for the 2018 financial year and subsequent financial years at \u20ac1,500,000, until the Annual General Meeting decides otherwise.\n\nThe  policy  for  allocating  directors'  compensation  adopted  by  the Board  of  Directors  on  October 18,  2019  sets  a  maximum  annual amount  of  directors'  compensation  for  participation  in  Board  of\n\nDirectors' meetings and meetings of each of the committees, which will include:\n\n- a fixed portion; P\n- a  variable  portion which depends on the effective attendance of P members at Board of Directors and/or committee meetings.\n\nThe  variable  portion  relating  to  effective  attendance  at  Board  of Directors and committee meetings is predominant compared to the fixed  portion,  in  compliance  with  the  recommendation  21.1  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code Committee\n\nThis compensation policy for directors was approved by the General Meeting of June 19, 2020 (sixteenth resolution).\n\nThe table below sets out the rules for calculating directors' compensation in 2020:\n\n|                             | Annual fixed portion   | Annual variable portion   | Total individual amounts   | Additional annual fixed portion for Chairmanship   | Additional annual fixed portion for Lead Independent Director   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors          | \u20ac18,000                | \u20ac35,000                   | \u20ac53,000                    | \u20ac0                                                 | \u20ac20,000                                                         |\n| CARC                        | \u20ac5,000                 | \u20ac15,000                   | \u20ac20,000                    | \u20ac20,000                                            | -                                                               |\n| Committees (excluding CARC) | \u20ac5,000                 | \u20ac10,000                   | \u20ac15,000                    | \u20ac10,000                                            | -                                                               |\n\nIt is reminded that the Chairman of the Board of Directors does not receive any compensation for his directorship.\n\nDirectors'  compensation  for  the  2020  financial  year  will  be  paid  in one instalment in 2021.\n\nIt  is  specified  that  the  three  directors  representing  employees  and the director representing employee shareholders hold employment contracts  within  subsidiaries  of  the  Company  and  receive  in  this respect  remuneration  that  is  not  related  to  the  exercise  of  their directorship. Therefore, such remuneration will not be disclosed.\n\nIn  addition,  directors  are  entitled  to  reimbursement  of  expenses incurred  by  them  in  the  exercise  of  their  office,  in  particular  any travel and accommodation expenses in connection with meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees.\n\nI\n\nPursuant  to  the  rules  of  the  compensation  policy  approved  by  the General Meeting of June 19, 2020, the theoretical total gross amount of compensation attributable to directors for the 2020 financial year amounts to \u20ac1,265,861.\n\nHowever,  given  the  coronavirus  pandemic  in  the  world,  and  in  a spirit  of  responsibility  towards  all  of  the  Group's  stakeholders  who have made efforts or experienced the effects of this unprecedented crisis, the directors unanimously decided on April 9, 2020, to reduce their compensation by 25%  for the 2020 financial year. Consequently,  the  total  gross  compensation  allocated  to  directors for the 2020 financial year amounts to \u20ac949,396.\n\nThe  individual  amounts  of  directors'  compensation,  accordingly reduced by 25%, are shown in the table below and will be paid in one lump sum in 2021.\n\nDirectors  currently  in  office  did  not  receive  any  compensation  or benefit of any kind from Renault SA or the companies it controls in 2021 other than what is indicated in the table below.",

However, as Renault SA does not have any  employees,  the  indicators  were  calculated  based  on  the compensation  of  the  France-based  employees  of  Renault  s.a.s, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  de  Transmissions  Automatiques  (STA)  and  Sofrastock,  all wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  Renault SA,  i.e.  31,600  people  who were  employed  in  2020.  The  scope  of  these  three  companies represents  84%  of  the  employees  of  the  Groupe  Renault's  French automotive subsidiaries as at December 31, 2020.\n\nCompensation  presented  in  the  table  includes  the  following components:\n\n- fixed compensation paid during the indicated financial year; P\n- variable compensation paid during the indicated financial year; P\n\nI\n\n- compensation  for  directorship,  if  applicable,  paid  during  the P indicated financial year;\n- book  value  of  the  benefits  in  kind  paid  during  the  indicated P financial year;\n- performance shares allocated during the indicated financial year P (at IFRS value);\n- profit-sharing  and  incentive  bonuses  paid  during  the  indicated P financial year.\n\nCompensation for both employees and corporate officers of Renault s.a.s,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  de  Transmissions  Automatiques  and  Sofrastock  has been annualized.\n\nThe relevant corporate officers for this comparison are the Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  latter  function  having existed within the Group up to January 24, 2019.\n\nThe  compensation  presented  is  related  to  the  function  and  not  to the person, so that a change in executive corporate officer for a same function  does  not  impact  the  presentation  of  the  information  over the five-year period. For the 2020 financial year, the Chief Executive Officer's  compensation  was  thus  annualized  on  the  basis  of  the compensation paid to Ms Clotilde Delbos in respect of her office for the period from January 1 to June 30, 2020 and the compensation paid to Mr. Luca de Meo for the period from July 1 to December 31, 2020.",

In addition  to  the  performance  criteria,  the  vesting  of  shares  is subject  to  a  presence  condition  of  three  years  following  the allocation of the performance shares.\n\nIn addition to these compensation components, the Chief Executive Officer  may  benefit  from  top-up  pension  schemes,  a  termination benefit in the event of dismissal and a non-compete agreement.\n\n## Annual fixed compensation\n\nThe  annual  fixed  compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer remains unchanged compared to that of 2020 and is set at a gross amount of \u20ac1,300,000, payable in twelve monthly instalments.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThe  amount  of  annual  variable  compensation  may  reach  150%  of the  fixed  compensation  paid  if  all  performance  criteria  are  fully achieved.  The  annual  variable  compensation  will  be  fully  paid  in cash.\n\nFor  the  2021  financial  year,  the  performance  criteria  set  by  the Board  of  Directors  include  five  quantifiable  criteria  and  three qualitative criteria.

The first phase of this \"Renaulution\" strategic plan will run until 2023 and will focus on improving margins and cash generation. In  order  to  ensure  a  close  link  between  the  Group's  strategy  and  the  compensation  policy,  it  is  therefore  proposed,  as  compared  to  the compensation policy for 2020, to remove one criterion and to add two new criteria:\n\n- the \"Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)\" criterion replaces the \"Turnover\" criterion in order to give priority to profitability objectives based P on capital employed, in line with the new value creation strategy; and;\n- the \"Fixed Costs (FC)\" criterion has been added since the reduction of fixed costs is key for the first phase \"Resurrection\" of the strategic plan P in order to ensure the success of the second phase \"Renovation\" of the plan.\n\nIn addition, the other criteria of the 2020 compensation policy are maintained because of their importance for the Group. These criteria are:\n\n- Group operating margin (Group OM); P\n- Cash generation - Free cash flow (FCF); and P\n- CO2 emissions (CAFE regulation). P\n\nAn equal weighting of 20% has been assigned to each of them.\n\n|                                                    | Group operating margin (Group OM)                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Free cash flow (FCF)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Return on capital  employed (ROCE)                                                                                                                                                                                        | CO2 emissions - CAFE  regulation **                                                                                                                                                                                           | Fixed costs (FC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Targets                                            | The operating margin is  P the key indicator of the  Company's profitability.                                                                                                                                                         | A high level of free cash  P flow demonstrates the  use of strict financial  discipline within the  Company, allowing  growth to be funded and  the possibility of dividend  payments.                                                                       | ROCE measures the  P profitability of capital  invested.

The gross annual compensation used for this calculation will be the one paid during the twelve months preceding the date of termination of the corporate office.\n\nIn  accordance with the recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code at the time of Mr. Luca de Meo's departure, the Board of Directors of the  Company  will  decide  whether  to  apply  this  non-compete agreement,  and  may  unilaterally  waive  it.  Furthermore,  no compensation will be due in the event of retirement or if Mr. Luca de Meo has reached the age of 65.\n\n## Top-up pension scheme\n\nDuring  its  meeting  on  February 13,  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors authorized a top-up pension scheme for Mr. Luca de Meo.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered that implementing this scheme to the benefit of Mr. Luca de Meo allows the Company to retain and to promote the Chief Executive Officer's loyalty.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's top-up pension scheme is identical to that  available  to  members  of  the  Group  Executive  Committee  (the so-called 'Article 83' plan and 'Article 82' plan).\n\n## Mandatory defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 83) a)\n\nThe contributions represent:\n\n- 3.5% of the gross annual compensation between four and eight P times the social security cap (Band C), paid 2.5% by the Company and 1% by the Chief Executive Officer;\n- then  8%  of  the  gross  annual  compensation  between  eight  and P sixteen times the annual French Social Security cap (Band D), paid 5% by the Company and 3% by the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  the  contributions  (both  Company's  and  CEO's share)  is  capped  at  a  lump  sum  equal  to  8%  of  eight  times  the French Social Security cap.\n\n## Optional defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 82) b)\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  benefits  from  the  new  optional defined-contribution  pension  scheme  (Article  82)  set  up  as  from May 1, 2020 for the benefit of the corporate officers and members of the Group's Executive Committee.\n\n## COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE OFFICERS\n\nThis  new  scheme  provides  for  the  payment  by  the  Company  to  a third-party entity (an insurer) of contributions equal to 12.5% of the gross annual compensation (fixed and variable) actually received.\n\nThe  contributions  paid  in  this  way  do  not  benefit  from  any preferential tax and social security regime. For this reason, the Chief Executive  Officer  will  receive  a  lump-sum  indemnity  equal  to  the amount  of  the  contribution  paid  on  his  behalf  to  the  insurer. Payment of  this  indemnity  will  be  concomitant  to  the  payment  of the contribution to the insurer.\n\nThe  contributions  and  lump-sum  indemnity  amounts  will  be dependent on the Company's performance insofar as the calculation basis  includes  the  variable  portion  of  the  compensation  which  is related to the Group's results.\n\n## Compensation policy for directors 3.2.4.3 for/uni00A0the 2021 financial year\n\nAt its meeting held on February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation  of  the  Governance  and  Compensation Committee, set  the  compensation  policy  for  directors  for  the  2021 financial year.\n\n## Draft  resolution  submitted  to  the  Annual  General Meeting of April/uni00A023, 2021 pursuant to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-8 of the French Commercial Code\n\n## Nineteenth resolution  -  Approval  of  the  compensation policy for directors for the 2021 financial year\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting under the conditions of quorum and majority required for Ordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the report on corporate governance referred to  in  Article L. 225-37  of  the  French  Commercial  Code describing  the  elements  of  the  compensation  policy  for corporate  officers  set  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  approves, pursuant  to  L.22-10-8  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the compensation policy for directors, as set out in chapter 3.2.4.3 of the Company's 2020 Universal registration document.\n\n## Overall budget for directors' compensation\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of June 15, 2018 set at \u20ac1,500,000 the maximum  amount  of  compensation  to  be  allocated  among  the directors (seventeenth resolution).\n\n## Allocation policy\n\nThe  new  policy  for  allocating  directors'  compensation  adopted  by the Board of Directors for the 2021 financial year consists of setting a maximum  annual  amount  of  directors'  compensation  for participation in Board of Directors' meetings and meetings of each of the committees, which will include:\n\n- a  fixed  portion,  pro-rated according to the duration of the office P over the year; and\n- a variable portion, pro-rated according to the attendance rate over P the total number of meetings for the year.\n\nI\n\n03",

Therefore, such remuneration will not be disclosed.\n\nIn  addition,  directors  are  entitled  to  reimbursement  of  expenses incurred  by  them  in  the  exercise  of  their  office,  in  particular  any travel and accommodation expenses in connection with meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees.\n\n## Compensation of senior executives: performance shares 3.2.5\n\n## Legal framework 3.2.5.1\n\nIn  its  eighteenth  resolution,  the  Combined  General  Meeting  on June 12, 2019 authorized the Board of Directors to proceed, on one or more occasions, with free allocations of existing Company shares and/or Company shares to be issued (so-called performance shares) for the benefit of salaried members of staff and/or corporate officers and/or  French  or  non-French  companies  or  groups  directly  or indirectly related to it, or certain categories thereof, pursuant to the terms of Article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nPerformance  share  plans  are  decided  annually  by  the  Board  of Directors on the recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation Committee.\n\nIn accordance with best market  practices, the vesting of performance  shares  is  subject  to  (i) performance  conditions  set  by the  Board  of  Directors  assessed  over  a  minimum  period  of  three years and (ii) a minimum vesting period of three years.\n\nThe  beneficiary  of  performance  shares  must  be  an  employee  or corporate officer  within  Groupe  Renault  at  the  vesting  date  of  the shares. In case of departure from Groupe Renault before the vesting date,  the  beneficiary  loses  his/her  entitlement  to  the  performance shares  granted  to  him/her,  except  in  the  case  of  compulsory  or voluntary early retirement.\n\nI\n\nIn the event of the death, total or partial invalidity, or extended sick leave of the beneficiary, they retain the benefit of the performance shares, and the performance conditions do not apply.\n\nPerformance share allocations granted pursuant to the aforementioned  authorization  are  subject  to  the  following  caps being observed:\n\n- the total number of performance shares allocated may not exceed P 2% of the share capital over three years, with a sub-limit of 0.67% of the share capital each year;\n- the total number of performance shares allocated may not exceed P 10%  of  the  share  capital  on  the  date  on  which  the  Board  of Directors decides on their allocation;\n- the number of performance shares allocated to senior executive P officers  may  not  exceed  15%  of  the  total  number  of  shares allocated;\n- the number of performance shares allocated to members of the P Executive Committee may not exceed 30% of the total number of shares  allocated,  including  performance  shares  allocated  to  the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPursuant  to  the  eighteenth  resolution  of  the  Combined  General Meeting  on  June 12,  2019,  performance  share  allocations  do  not result  in  any  dilution  for  the  shareholders,  as  the  performance shares allocated are shares held by the Company itself.\n\nThe authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting of June 12, 2019 to the Board of Directors to allocate performance shares will expire in 2022.",

The  committee  examines  the  allocation proposals  for  certain  Groupe  Renault  employees  presented  by  the Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the general scheme set by the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## The purpose of share allocations\n\nThe aim of performance share allocations is primarily to personally associate  the  worldwide  management  of  Groupe  Renault,  in particular the members  of  management  bodies,  with  the development  of  the  Group's  value  by  allowing  them  to  share ownership of the Company.\n\nIt  also  provides  recognition  of  executives  whose  outstandingly positive action has contributed to Groupe Renault's results.\n\nLastly, it helps to promote loyalty in executives who are of particular value to the Company, notably executives with a high potential for career  development.  The  allocation  of  shares  increases  their commitment and motivation to implement progress and growth in the Company.\n\nThis scheme has proved to be a factor in strengthening the role of responsibility  centres  throughout  Groupe  Renault  worldwide,  more particularly in the Automotive sector, sales subsidiaries, vehicle and mechanical engineering, bodywork and power train plant managers, industrial  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  for  all  program  managers  and vehicles or components project managers. It is also applied in sales financing, as well as for the managers of large support functions in Groupe Renault.\n\n## Share allocation policy\n\nAllocation  is  differentiated  according  to  beneficiaries'  level  of responsibility and contribution, on the basis of the appraisal of their performance and results, and according to the assessment of their development potential.\n\nBeneficiaries are divided into three categories.\n\n## STOCK OPTION PLANS\n\n## (TABLE NO./uni00A08 AS PER AFEP-MEDEF CODE RECOMMENDATIONS)\n\n| Allocation date/ Board of  Directors' meeting date                          | Total number of shares available for purchase                               | - to the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn           | Start date of the exercise period                                           | Expiry date                                                                 | Purchase Price  (1)                                                         | Number of options exercised as of 12/31/2020                                | Total number of cancelled or lapsed options as of 12/31/2020                | Outstanding options as of 12/31/2020                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 | Authorization by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2011 |\n| Plan n\u00b0 20  (2) 12/13/2012                                                  | 447 800                                                                     | 150 000                                                                     | 12/13/2016                                                                  | 12/12/2020                                                                  | \u20ac37.43                                                                      | 471                                                                         | 102 516                                                                     | 0                                                                           |\n\n- The purchase price is equal to the average stock market price over the 20 sessions prior to the date of the Board of Directors' meeting.

Certain  senior  executives  may  not  be beneficiaries.\n\n## Other beneficiary executives\n\nThe other beneficiaries are usually senior managers and managers with high professional or managerial development potential or with a  high  level  of  expertise.  There  are  numerous  complementary systems  for  assessing  and  selecting  these  beneficiaries  (level  of responsibility, annual  appraisal  interview, career committees, specific monitoring for high potential executives, etc .); these systems allow various observations which help us to find the most deserving candidates.\n\nThe  total  number  of  beneficiaries  was  1,060  under  the  2017  plan, 1,123 under the 2018 plan, 1,322 under the 2019 plan et 1,421 under the 2020 plan.\n\n## Summary tables 3.2.5.3\n\n## Past allocations of stock options and performance shares\n\nPlan no. 20 is performance share allocation.\n\nPlans  nos. 22  to nos. 27  are  performance  share  allocation  plans  in which  some  of  the  shares  were  allocated  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer and subject to an additional performance criterion compared to the shares in the plan allocated to other beneficiaries.\n\nThe  size  of  the  plans  outstanding  as  of  December 31,  2020 corresponds to 1.49% of the Company's share capital.\n\n03",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the  French  Code  of  Ethics  (C ode  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors  for  the  period  from  January 1,  2020  to  the  date  of  our  report  and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions.  Indeed,  this  crisis  and  the  exceptional  measures  taken  in  the  context  of  the  state  of  sanitary  emergency  have  had  numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel  restrictions  and  remote  working,  have  also  had  an  impact  on  the  companies'  internal  organization  and  the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## VALUATION OF LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTORS\n\nRisk identified\n\nIntangible and tangible assets and goodwill, of the 'Automotive' operating segments amount to 23,001 million euros.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nThe test consists in comparing the net book value of assets with their recoverable value, defined as the higher amount between the value in use and the fair value net of exit costs. The value in use is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nThe Group carries out impairment tests on assets as soon as an impairment risk indicator has been identified, and at least once a year for assets with infinite useful life, under the approach described in note 2-M of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor 2020 year-end closing, these impairment tests consider the decline in sales volumes in 2020, the downward revision of the outlook in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the assumptions used in the update of the Renaulution medium-term plan (2021-2025).\n\nWe have considered that the valuation of assets is a key audit matter because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the estimates and judgments required from Management to prepare these tests, particularly in the current context described above.\n\nDuring our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- for assets tested: P\n- understanding the analysis performed by Management in order to identify impairment indicators; P\n- reconciling the net book value of assets to the consolidated financial statements, P\n- assessing, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reasonableness of the main assumptions used through interviews with management and by P comparing the assumptions with the data used in the previous impairment tests as well as, if applicable, with the historical performance,\n- assessing the consistency of the data on projected volumes and margins used in the tests with the latest management estimates reflected in the P Renaulution medium-term plan for the period 2021-2025 and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n- testing the arithmetical accuracy of the discounted cash flows projections prepared by management, P\n- performing sensitivity analysis on the main assumptions used. P\n- comparing the discount rate after tax used with external data available, P\n\n## CONSOLIDATION METHOD AND RECOVERABLE VALUE OF THE EQUITY INVESTMENT OF RENAULT IN NISSAN\n\nRisk identified\n\nOur audit response\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the Renault equity investment in Nissan amounts to 14,618 million euros, and Nissan's contribution to Renault's net income corresponds to a loss of 4,970 million euros.\n\nIn accordance with the approach described in the accounting rules and methods (note 2-M), an impairment test of the investment in Nissan was carried out at December 31, 2020.\n\nAs indicated in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, Renault has a significant influence over Nissan and accounts for its investment using the equity method. The Nissan accounts used to prepare Renault's financial statements are Nissan's consolidated accounts published in compliance with Japanese accounting standards, adjusted according to IFRS standards for consolidation purposes.\n\nWe have considered that the consolidation method and recoverable value of the equity investment in Nissan is a key audit matter given its magnitude to Renault's consolidated financial statements, and given the following areas of attention: (1) the judgment of management to assess the Alliance governance structure as well as facts and circumstances underlying Renault's significant influence over Nissan, (2) the completeness of adjustments to Nissan's financial statements required to account for Renault's share in the result and equity of this company and their accuracy, (3) the estimates used by management in determining the recoverable value of Renault's investment in Nissan.\n\nOur audit response to the risks identified mainly consisted in:\n\n- understanding the conclusions and the audit work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan in accordance with our instructions which detail P the procedures to be performed and the conclusion format required for our audit purposes;\n- reading the minutes of the Board of Directors meetings and the related party agreements and commitments register and obtaining confirmation from P management that there were no changes in the governance of Nissan and of the Alliance and/or no new contracts structuring the relations between Renault and Nissan which could modify the analysis of the significant influence exercised by Renault over Nissan;\n- understanding the audit work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan over the homogenization adjustments required to Nissan's financial P statements to match with Renault accounting policies;\n- examining the relevance of the main assumptions used by Renault in the impairment test performed to assess the recoverable value of its investment in P Nissan, by reference to Nissan mid-term plan, historical performance achieved by Nissan as well as the overall perspectives of the Automotive sector;\n- assessing whether there are any identified impairment indicators, the main indicators being significant adverse changes on markets where Nissan P operates or a significant and long lasting drop in Nissan stock market value;\n- assessing the appropriateness of the information provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. P\n\n## CALCULATION OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ON RETAIL AND WHOLESALE RECEIVABLES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD IFRS/uni00A09 (RCI)\n\nRisk identified\n\nOur audit response\n\nThe sales financing activity is managed by RCI Banque with dedicated offers for individuals and companies as well as the financing of dealer networks. RCI Banque sets aside provisions to cover the risk of losses resulting from the inability of its clients to meet their financial commitments. RCI Banque applies the accounting principles of IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\" which defines a provisioning model for expected losses based on three stages of risk: healthy receivables (stage 1), receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition (stage 2), and receivables in default (stage 3). The provisions related to IFRS 9 are detailed in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements and amounts to 1,064 M\u20ac for an outstanding amount of 41,884 M\u20ac.\n\nWe consider the amount of credit loss provisioning as a key point of the audit, due to the significant amount of customer and network loans in the assets of the Group's balance sheet, the use of numerous parameters and assumptions in the calculation models and the use of judgment made by management in estimating expected credit losses. Those assumptions are even more important in the current situation of the COVID-19 crisis which brings major economical uncertainties in the world for the years to come in spite of the governement measures taken to favor a rapid economic recovery. Note 15-D of the consolidated financial statements describes the assumptions used to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. They mainly consisted of additional provisioning on non-overdue outstanding amounts concerned by current or previous moratoriums, to raise the provision estimate for the forward-looking scenario concerning and to increase the weighting of the 'adverse' forward-looking scenario.\n\nOur procedures, performed with our specialists in credit risk, mainly consisted in:\n\n- assessing the methodologies applied to set the parameters used in the provisionning models and their operational integration in the information P systems;\n- assessing the key controls related to the governance established to validate the changes in parameters and key assumptions involved in the calculation P of the expected credit loss provisionning;\n- assessing the provisionning adjustments made on expertise at local and Group levels on the Corporates and dealers on receivables showing higher credit P risk since initial recognition (stage 2), and receivables in default (stage 3);\n- assessing the assumptions used to determine the prospective component of the expected credit loss (forward looking) estimation, in particular on the P weighting of the scenarios;\n- examining the documentation supporting the additional provisionning booked to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in the cost of risk and P verifying the calculation of the provisionning on a sampling of contracts;\n- testing the quality of the application program interfaces that support the calculation and accounting of the expected credit losses; P\n- ensuring the completeness and the quality of the data used in the estimation of the provisionning; P\n- evaluating the staging process and most particularly the identification of the significant increase of credit risk on healthy receivables; P\n- carrying out analytical procedures on the evolution of outstanding retail customer and dealer network loans and credit risk impairment; P\n- assessing the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes 2-G and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ),  our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises  professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs P and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\nI",

This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report.  However,  future  events  or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying P transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to P express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  statutory  auditor  is  responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision  and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this audit report.\n\nWe also provide the  Audit,  Risks  and  Compliance  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in  Article 6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors . Where appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit,  Risks  and  Compliance  Committee  the  risks  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, February 24, 2021\n\nThe statutory auditors French original signed by\n\nKPMG Audit A division of KPMG\u00a0S.A.\n\nBertrand Pruvost\n\nMAZARS\n\nLoic Wallaert\n\n04",

        "page_content": "## Information on operating segments 4.2.6.1 and Regions\n\nThe operating segments defined by Renault are the following:\n\n- the 'Automotive' segments,  which  in  practice  consist  of  two P segments:\n- the  'Automotive  excluding  AVTOVAZ'  segment,  consisting  of P the Group's automotive activities as they existed before Renault acquired  control  of  the  AVTOVAZ  group  under  IFRS 10.  This segment  comprises  the  production,  sales,  and  distribution subsidiaries  for  passenger  cars  and  light  commercial  vehicles, automotive  service  subsidiaries  for  the  Renault,  Dacia  and Samsung  brands,  and  the  subsidiaries  in  charge  of  the segment's  cash  management.  It  also  includes  investments  in automotive-sector  associates  and  joint  ventures,  principally Nissan,\n- the 'AVTOVAZ' segment, consisting of the Russian automotive P group AVTOVAZ and its parent company Alliance Rostec Auto B.V.,  which  was  formed  at  the  end  of  2016,  after  Renault acquired  control  over  them,  as  defined  by  IFRS 10,  in December 2016;\n- the 'Sales Financing' segment, which the Group considers as an P operating activity in its own right, carried out for the distribution network and final customers by RCI Banque, its subsidiaries and its investments in associates and joint ventures;\n- the 'Mobility  Services' segment,  created  on  January 1,  2020, P consisting of services for new mobilities brought together in the holding  company  Renault  MAI  (Mobility  As  an  Industry).  This segment includes Flit Technologies Ltd. and its subsidiaries (a taxi reservation platform), Coolnagour Ltd. and its subsidiaries\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(software development for taxis under the iCabbi brand), Glide.io (car-share  services)  and  the  joint  venture  Car  Sharing  Mobility (car-share services under the Zity brand). The 2019 figures have not  been  restated  due  to  the  non-significant  nature  of  these operations, which are included in the Sales Financing in 2019.\n\nThe  segment  result  regularly  reviewed  by  the  Group  Executive Committee,  identified  as  the  'Chief  Operating  Decision-Maker',  is the operating margin .  The definition of this indicator is unchanged from previous years and is detailed in the note 2-D \"Presentation of the  consolidated  financial  statements\".  This  interim  result  is  no longer  presented  in  the  consolidated  income  statement.  It  is  only reported  in  the  consolidated  income  statements  by  operating segment below.\n\nThe operating margin excludes restructuring costs. The definition of these  costs  has  been  reviewed  to  bring  it  into  line  with  IAS 37 'Provisions,  Contingent  liabilities  and  Contingent  assets',  which defines  'a  restructuring'  as  'a  program  that  is  planned  and controlled  by  management,  and  materially  changes  either:  a)  the scope  of  a  business  undertaken  by  an  entity;  or  b)  the  manner  in which  that  business  is  conducted.'  The  impact  of  this  change  on previous periods is considered non-significant and its determination is not practicable. Consequently, no adjustments have been made to the amounts of the operating margin for those periods.\n\nThe  new  brand-based  organization  announced  by  Luca  de  Meo, effective from 2021, will not affect the operating segments defined above.

This amendment offers an optional exemption for lessees,  allowing  them  to  recognize  lease  payment  reductions granted by agreement with lessors in profit and loss. This applies to lease payments initially due up to June 30, 2021. Lessees can choose to apply IFRS 16 unamended, i.e. carry out a detailed analysis of rent concession agreements and treat them as modifications to the lease if  necessary.  The  Groupe  Renault  has  not  applied  this  IFRS 16 amendment in the financial statements at December 31, 2020. The concessions from which the Group has benefited have no significant impact.\n\n## OTHER STANDARDS APPLIED BY THE GROUP FROM JANUARY/uni00A01, 2020\n\nFrom  January 1,  2020  the  Group  applies  phase 3  of  IFRS 9 concerning  hedge  accounting.  This  has  no  material  impact  on  the Group's  financial  statements,  but  allows  an  aggregated  position consisting  of  an  exposure  and  a  derivative  to  be  designated  as hedged item in the Sales Financing segment.\n\nThe Groupe Renault has opted for early application, at December 31, 2020,  of  the  amendments  to  IAS 39,  IFRS 9  and  IFRS 7  concerning phase 2  of  the  interest  rate  benchmark  reform.  From  July 2020, interest on the Sales Financing segment's margin call account with\n\nI\n\nFrance's  clearing  house  switched  from  the  Euro  overnight  index average (EONIA) to the Euro short-term rate (ESTER). Application of these amendments allows the Group to modify the effective rate for this  financial  instrument  prospectively.  This  has  no  immediate impact on the income statement.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, no other financial instrument negotiated with a non-Group counterparty had been renegotiated as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. The Automotive segments (through the  intermediary  of  Renault  Finance)  adhered  to  the ISDA  2018 Benchmarks Supplement Protocol , and the Sales Financing segment adhered  to  the ISDA  2020  Fallbacks  protocol governing  fallback clauses.\n\nThe  Groupe  Renault  has  identified  the  interest  rate  benchmarks used in interest rate hedging relationships that are concerned by the reform: Libor Euro, Libor GBP and Libor CHF. The Group considers there  is  no  uncertainty  regarding  the  future  of  the  Euribor  index since  it  was  validated  as  benchmark  regulation-compliant  by  the European  Banking  Authority.  At  December 31,  2020,  the  Sales Financing segment had interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges  amounting  to  CHF300 million  (floating  rate  indexed  on LIBOR CHF) and \u00a3100 million (floating rate indexed on Libor GBP). The  risk  hedging  strategies  have  so  far  not  been  modified  by  the transition to the new benchmark rates\n\nEarly application of these amendments has no impact on the Group's financial statements at December 31, 2020.\n\n## OTHER STANDARDS AND AMENDMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\nThe  IASB  has  also  published  the  following  new  standards  and amendments  that  have  not  yet  been  adopted  by  the  European Union.",

Consequently,  the  effects  of  restatement  and translation of the equity of subsidiaries located in Argentina are now reported  in  the  translation  adjustment  in  other  components  of comprehensive  income,  whereas  the  effects  of  index-based restatement  were  included  in  reserves  in  the  2018  and  2019 financial statements. The change  led to reclassification of \u20ac349 million  to  the  translation  adjustment  reserve  at  January 1, 2020.\n\n## Application of the IFRIC agenda decision concerning A3 recognition of the impacts of reverse factoring programs in the statement of financial position and cash flow statement\n\nIn December 2020  the  IFRIC  published  an  agenda  decision concerning reverse factoring programs, concluding that the existing standards are sufficient for appropriate treatment of such programs in  the  financial  position  and  cash  flow  statement.  This  decision notably clarifies that supplier payables covered by reverse factoring programs should be classified in the statement of financial position as  trade  payables or financial liabilities,  or  presented  in  a  separate line.  The  treatment  applied  by  the  Group  to  these  programs  is consistent with this decision (see note 2-P).\n\nThe IFRIC's decision also clarifies that the presentation in the cash flow  statement  depends  on  the  analysis  of  the  transaction, particularly because  a  repayment  considered  to  concern  a non-operating finance arrangement must be classified as a cash flow from  financing  activities.  To  date,  the  Group  has  presented repayments  of  liabilities  covered  by  reverse  factoring  programs  as cash flows from operating activities, even when the transaction was considered  a  financing  operation.  The  amounts  concerned  in  2020 have  been  reclassified  in  accordance  with  the  IFRIC  decision  (see section 4.2.6.1 - A4). The amounts concerned in previous years have not been reclassified since they are not significant.\n\n## Estimates and judgments 2 - B -\n\n## Specific context of 2020\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that appeared in the first quarter  of  2020  and  continued  throughout  the  year,  the  global automotive market suffered a downturn of 14.4% compared to 2019. To  protect  its  employees,  and  in  compliance  with  the  measures introduced by national governments, the Groupe Renault suspended its  commercial  and  production  activities  in  most  countries  during March.  During  the  lockdown  periods,  practically  all  employees  not working  in  production  and  sales  worked  from  home,  and  furlough measures were put in place. Production and sales resumed mainly from May 2020, respecting the end-of-lockdown measures imposed by the governments of the countries where the Groupe Renault has operations. A second lockdown and curfews were imposed in several countries, including France, during the second half of the year, and these  also  had  negative  effects  on  the  Group's  business  activity. Total sales volumes for 2020 were thus 21.3% lower than in 2019, at 2,951,971 vehicles.\n\nTo maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for operations, the Groupe Renault arranged a \u20ac5 billion credit  line  guaranteed  by  the  French government,  on  which  it  made  three  drawings  totalling  \u20ac4 billion (note 23). At December 31, 2020, the undrawn amount of \u20ac1 billion is  no  longer  available.  The  Group  also  issued  a  new  bond  in November 2020 with a nominal value of \u20ac1 billion (note 23-C). At the date  of  publication  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Group  has  sufficient  cash  and  sources  of  financing  to  ensure continuity of operations for the next twelve months (note 25-B) and demonstrated its capacity to issue debt in the second half of the year (note 23-C).\n\nExpenses  and  income  recognized  that  are  identified  as  resulting wholly or partly from the COVID-19 pandemic are not considered as 'Other operating income and expenses', except for expenses which due  to  their  nature  are  always  included  in  that  category,  such  as impairment of tangible and intangible assets.\n\nPayroll costs net of state aid received by Renault, additional logistics costs, the costs of introducing new  health  protocols, and depreciation  on  assets  unused  or  only  partially-used  during  the period because of the lockdown rules are allocated to the relevant functions (cost of goods and services sold, research and development  expenses,  and  selling,  general  and  administrative expenses).  The  amounts  concerned  are  not  reported  because  it  is impossible to reliably identify the amounts solely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI\n\n04",

The principal impacts are \u20ac762 million of impairment in respect of certain tangible and intangible assets (see note 6), \u20ac248 million resulting from discontinuation of recognition of deferred  tax  assets  (see  note 8-A),  and  a  \u20ac216 million  increase  in impairment for expected credit losses on sales financing receivables (see note 15). Estimation of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic described in this chapter on the financial statements is particularly complex and involves the use of judgments that are explained in the notes, where relevant.\n\nOn April 14,  2020  the  Groupe  Renault  announced  its  new  business strategy in China, and the signature of a preliminary agreement with Dongfeng  Motor  Corporation  under  which  Renault  transferred  its shares in the joint-venture Dongfeng Renault Automotive Company Ltd.  (DRAC)  to  Dongfeng.  DRAC  ceased  operations concerning the Renault brand on April 1, 2020 (see notes 3 and 6-B). The Groupe Renault is refocusing its business activities in China on light commercial  vehicles (through Renault Brilliance Jinbei Automotive Co. Ltd. (RBJAC) - see note 13) and on electric vehicles (through New Energy Automotive Co. Ltd. (eGT) and Jiangxi Jiangling Group Electric Vehicle Co. Ltd. (JMEV) - see note 3).\n\nOn November 20, 2020 the Groupe Renault signed an agreement in France  with  its  social  partners  to  transform  technical  and  service skills  in  preparation  for  future  developments  in  the  automotive world.  This  agreement  lays  down  the  conditions  for  a  new outplacement policy, and includes a voluntary work-exemption plan for  relevant  personnel  in  2021,  and  a  Collective  Contractual Separation plan for a maximum 1,900 employee departures. In the foreign subsidiaries, the Group is rolling out restructuring actions in line with the 2022 cost reduction plan. Restructuring and workforce adjustments  have  been  recognized  for  these  plans  (notes 6-A  and 20).\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the new strategy in China, new workforce reduction plans and the new medium-term business plan  Renaulution  (2021-2025),  the  main  items  in  the  Group's consolidated financial statements that are dependent on estimates and  judgments  and  have  been  paid  particular  attention  are  the following:\n\n- potential  impairment  of  fixed  assets,  particularly  impairment  on P specific  assets  linked  to  vehicles  (see  note 6-C),  the  goodwill  of AVTOVAZ and the LADA brand (see note 11);\n- the  recoverable  value  of  leased  vehicles  classified  as  property, P plant and equipment or inventories (notes 2-G, 11 and 14);\n- investments  in  associates,  notably  Nissan  and  RBJAC  (see P notes 12 and 13);\n- impairment for expected credit losses concerning Sales Financing P receivables (notes 2-G and 15);\n- determination  of  expenses  to  be  paid  under  sales  incentive P programs recorded in other liabilities, in a context of sales price pressure (notes 2-G and 21);\n- determination of restructuring provisions (see note 6-A and 20); P\n\nI\n\n- determination of risks associated with distressed suppliers; P\n- the  potential  impact  of  the  European  CAFE  (Corporate  Average P Fuel  Economy)  regulation  from  2020:  under  this  regulation, carmakers will be fined if the average CO2 emissions target for all vehicles registered in Europe each calendar year is exceeded (see note 28-A2).\n\nThis list is not exhaustive due to the constantly evolving COVID-19 situation  and  its  effects  on  the  financial  health  of  the  world's economies,  and  it  remains  very  difficult  to  predict  the  magnitude and duration of the pandemic's economic impacts on our business.\n\n## Other important estimates and judgments\n\nRenault  often  has  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the book value of certain assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures made in certain notes to the financial statements. In preparing  its  financial  statements,  Renault  regularly  revises  its estimates and assessments to take account of past experience and other factors deemed  relevant in view of the economic circumstances. If changes in these assumptions or circumstances are not  as  anticipated,  the  figures  reported  in  Renault's  future consolidated  financial  statements  could  differ  from  the  estimates established  at  the  time  these  financial  statements  were  finalized. The main items in the Group's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2020 that are dependent on estimates and judgments are the following:\n\n- capitalization  of  research  and  development  expenses  and  their P amortization period (notes 2-K and 10-A);\n- the  depreciation  and  amortization  periods  for  fixed  assets  other P than capitalized development expenses (notes 2-K, 2-L and 10);\n- recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  on  tax  loss  carryforwards P (notes 2-I and 8);\n- provisions,  particularly  warranty  provisions  on  vehicles  and P batteries  sold  (note 2-G),  provisions  for  pensions  and  other long-term  employee  benefit  obligations  (notes 2-S  and  19), provisions  for  workforce  adjustment  measures  (notes 2-T  and 6-A), provisions for legal risks and tax risks (other than income tax risks) (note 20)  and  provisions  for  uncertain  tax  liabilities (note 21);\n- valuation of lease liabilities, particularly the incremental P borrowing  rates  and  the  value  of  renewal  options  that  are reasonably certain to be exercised (note 23).\n\n## Consolidation principles 2 - C -\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements  of  all  companies  controlled  exclusively  by  the  Group either directly or indirectly (subsidiaries). Jointly controlled companies  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  when  they are classified as joint ventures and consolidated on the basis of the percentage  share  specific  to  each  balance  sheet  and  income statement item when they are classified as joint operations.\n\nCompanies  in  which  the  Group  exercises  significant  influence (associates)  are  included  in  the  financial  statements  on  an  equity basis.",

P\n\nPut  options  on  non-controlling  interests  are  carried  in  the consolidated  financial  position  at  fair  value,  and  classified  in  other financial  liabilities  in  the  Automotive  segments  and  in  other non-current  liabilities  in  the  Sales  Financing  segment,  with  a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\n## Presentation of the consolidated financial 2 - D statements\n\n## Valuation basis\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  established  under  the historical cost convention, except for certain categories of assets and liabilities,  in  compliance  with  IFRS  rules.  The  categories  concerned are detailed in the following notes.\n\n## Operating income and operating margin\n\nOperating income includes all revenues and costs directly related to the Group's activities, whether  recurrent  or  resulting from non-recurring decisions or operations, such as restructuring costs.\n\nThe operating margin, which corresponds to the operating income of an  individual  segment  as  defined  in  IFRS 8  \"Operating  Segments\", corresponds to the operating income before other operating income and  expenses  that  are  by  nature  unusual  or  significant  and  could affect  comparability  of  the  margin.  Other  operating  income  and expenses mainly include:\n\n- restructuring  and  workforce  adjustment  costs,  and  significant P costs  relating  to  discontinued  activities.  Restructuring  costs  are defined  as  follows  in  the  definition  given  in  IAS 37  'Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets': 'A restructuring is a program  that  is  planned  and  controlled  by  management,  and materially changes either: a) the scope of a business undertaken by  the  entity;  or  b)  the  manner  in  which  that  business  is conducted';\n- gains  or  losses  on  partial  or  total  disposal  of  businesses  or P operating entities, gains or losses on total or partial disposals of investments  in  associates  and  joint  ventures,  other  gains  and losses  relating  to  changes  in  the  scope  of  consolidation  such  as acquisitions  of  control,  as  defined  by  IFRS 10,  over  entities previously  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method,  and  direct acquisition  costs  for  entities  that  are  fully  consolidated  or consolidated on a line-by-line percentage of interest basis;\n- gains  or  losses  on  disposal  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  or P intangible assets (except leased assets sales);\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- impairment on property, plant and equipment or intangible assets P and goodwill (excluding goodwill of associates or joint ventures);\n- unusual items, i.e. income  and  charges  that  are  unusual  in  their P frequency,  nature  or  amount,  relating  to  significant  litigation  or impairment of operating receivables.\n\n## Equity method consolidation of associates and joint ventures\n\nThe share in net income of associates and joint ventures reported in the Group's consolidated income statement comprises the share in these  entities'  profits  or  losses,  impairment  and  recoveries  of impairment  relating  to  these  entities  (note 2-M).  The  impairment booked is limited to the net book value of the investment, unless an additional commitment has been made.\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  the  sale  or  loss  of  significant influence  or  joint  control  over  associates  and  joint  ventures accounted  for  by  the  equity  method,  and  the  gain  or  loss  on acquisition  of  control,  as  defined  by  IFRS 10,  over  companies  that were  already  consolidated  but  not  controlled,  is  reported  in  other operating income and expenses in the Group's consolidated income statement.  This  includes  transfers  of  accumulated  translation adjustments during the period the entity was accounted for by the equity method.\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  deferred  tax  liability on dividend distributions for all differences between the book and tax values of its investments in associates and joint ventures (note 2-I). This tax is included  in  current  and  deferred  taxes  in  the  Group's  income statement.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the value  of  the  relevant  entities  as  stated  in  the  assets  in  the consolidated  statement  of  financial  position.  In  the  event  of impairment,  an  impairment  loss  is  booked  and  included  in  the consolidated income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures (note 2-J).\n\nAcquisition expenses related to investments in associates and joint ventures  are  included  in  the  initial  acquisition  cost  for  these investments.\n\nCross-investments  between  a  consolidated  entity  and  an  associate are  neutralized  in  measuring  the  investment  in  the  associate  as stated in the assets of the statement of financial position. Nissan's 15%  stake  in  Renault  is  therefore  neutralized  in  valuing  the investment  in  Nissan  shown  in  the  assets  of  the  consolidated statement of financial position (note 12).\n\nDividends  received  from  unlisted  associates  and  joint  ventures  are included  in  the  Automotive  segments'  operational  free  cash  flow, while  dividends  received  from  listed  associates  and  joint  ventures, i.e. Nissan, are excluded from the operational free cash flow of the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment.\n\n## Reporting by operating segment\n\nThe information by operating segment is based on internal reporting to the Group Executive Committee, identified as the 'Chief Operating Decision-Maker'.  This  information  is  prepared  under  the  IFRSs applicable  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  All  Group financial  data  are  assigned  to  the  operating  segments.  The 'Intersegment transactions'  and  'Intra-Automotive'  columns  are reserved for transactions between the segments, which are carried out  on  near-market  terms.  Dividends  paid  by  the  Sales  Financing segment  to  the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  are\n\n04",

The  tax  effect  inherent  to  the  French  consolidated  taxation system is included in the tax expense of the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment.\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  are  specific  to  each  segment.  Receivables assigned  by  the  Automotive  segments  to  the  Sales  Financing companies are treated as operating assets by the assignee when the risks  and  benefits  are  substantially  transferred.  These  receivables are mostly receivables on the dealership network.\n\nVehicles  and  batteries  for  which  the  Automotive  (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment has a repurchase commitment are included in the segment's assets. When these assets are financed by the Sales Financing  segment,  the  Sales  Financing  segment  recognizes  a receivable on the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment.\n\n## Current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\nSales  Financing  receivables,  other  securities,  derivatives,  loans  and financial  liabilities  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment  (other  than redeemable  shares  and  subordinated  loans)  are  considered  as current assets and liabilities, because they are used in this operating segment's normal business cycle.\n\nFor the Automotive segments, in addition to items directly related to the business cycle, all assets and liabilities maturing within one year are classified as current.\n\n## Translation of the financial statements of 2 - E foreign companies\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is the euro.\n\nFor foreign companies, the functional currency is generally the local currency.  In  cases  where  most  transactions  are  carried  out  in  a different currency, that is adopted as the functional currency.\n\nForeign  companies'  accounts  are  established  in  their  functional currency, and subsequently translated into the Group's presentation currency as follows:\n\n- financial  position  items  other  than  components  of  shareholders' P equity, which are stated at historical value, are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- income statement items are translated at the average exchange P rate for the period;\n- the  translation  adjustment  is  one  of  the  other  components  of P comprehensive  income,  and  therefore  has  no  impact  on  net income.\n\nGoodwill  generated  by  a  business  combination  with  a  foreign company is treated as an asset or liability of the entity acquired, as appropriate.  It  is  therefore  expressed  in  the  relevant  entity's functional currency, and translated into euros at the closing rate.\n\nI\n\nWhen  a  foreign  company  is  sold,  the  accumulated  translation adjustments  on  its  assets  and  liabilities  are  transferred  to  other operating income and expenses in the income statement.\n\nIn an exception to the above principles, the financial statements of entities in hyperinflationary economies are translated in accordance with  IAS 29  'Financial  reporting  in  hyperinflationary  economies'. Non-monetary  balance  sheet  items,  income  statement  items, comprehensive  income  items  and  cash  flow  statement  items  are adjusted  for  inflation  in  their  original  local  currency,  then  all  the financial statements are translated at the closing exchange rate for the period. This hyperinflationary accounting leads to recognition of a  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  exposure  to  hyperinflation,  which  is classified as other financial income and expenses and thus included in reserves the following year.\n\nThe effects of index-based restatement and translation of the equity of  subsidiaries  in  Argentina  are  all  included  in  the  translation adjustment  in  other  components  of  comprehensive  income,  since restatement based on price indexes is correlated with movements in the exchange rate between the Argentinian peso and the euro, and mitigates the effect of the peso's devaluation.\n\nTo  determine  whether  a  country  is  in  hyperinflation,  the  Group refers to the list published by the International Practices Task Force (IPTF)  of  the  Center  for  Audit  Quality.  The  financial  statements  of the Group's subsidiaries in Argentina are consolidated in accordance with the principles of IAS 29, which are applied from January 1, 2018. As operations in Iran are no longer consolidated, the Group has no other subsidiary in countries on the IPTF list.\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions 2 - F -\n\nTransactions  undertaken  in  a  currency  other  than  the  functional currency  of  the  entity  concerned  are  initially  translated  to  and recorded in the functional currency, using the rate applicable at the transaction date.\n\nFor  financial  reporting  purposes,  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the closing rate. All resulting foreign exchange  differences  are recognized  in  the  income  statement,  except  for  foreign  exchange gains and losses on financial instruments designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity (note 2-X). The following impacts are therefore recorded in net income:\n\n- translation  adjustments  related  to  financial  operations  by  the P Automotive segments are included in the net financial income;\n- other  translation  adjustments  are  included  in  the  operating P income  (operating  margin  in  the  information  by  operating segment).\n\nDerivatives are measured and recorded as described in note 2-X.\n\n## Revenues and margin 2 - G -\n\nRevenues  comprise  all  proceeds  from  sales  of  the  Group's automotive  goods,  services  related  to  these  sales,  and  the  various Sales  Financing  products  marketed  by  the  Group's  companies  to their customers.",

        "page_content": "## Sales of goods and services SALES AND MARGIN RECOGNITION\n\nSales  of  automotive  goods  are  recognized  at  the  date  control  is transferred.  The  transfer  of  control  over  automotive  goods  takes place when the goods are made available to the distribution network in  the case of non-Group dealers (at the time they are added to or removed from stock, depending on the contractual arrangements) or upon delivery to the end-user in the case of direct sales.\n\nHowever,  there  is  no  transfer  of  control  in  the  case  of  goods  sold under an operating lease by a Group finance company, or in the case of  goods sold with a buyback commitment if it is highly likely that they  will  be  returned.  In  such  transactions,  the  revenues  are recognized  progressively  over  the  lease  period,  and  a  used  vehicle sale is recorded when control of the used vehicle is transferred. The difference between the price paid by the customer and the buyback price  is  treated  as  rental  income  and  spread  over  the  period  the automotive item is at the customer's disposal. The production cost for the new automotive item concerned is recorded in inventories for contracts  of  less  than  one  year,  or  included  in  property,  plant  and equipment  under  fixed  assets  leased  to  customers  when  the contracts exceed one year. The forecast resale value takes account of recent known developments on the second-hand automotive market but  also  future  anticipated  developments  over  the  period  in  which the  automotive  goods  will  be  sold,  which  may  be  influenced  by factors  both  external  (economic  situation,  taxation)  and  internal (changes  in  the  range  or  the  manufacturer's  pricing  strategy).  As soon  as  a  loss  is  expected  on  the  resale,  a  provision  (if  the automotive item is in inventories) or additional depreciation (if the automotive  item  is  included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment)  is recognized to cover the loss.\n\n## SALES INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\nSales incentive programs based on the volumes or prices of products sold are deducted from sales when the sales operations concerned are  recorded.  Any  provisions  are  based  on  estimates  of  the  most probable amount.\n\nThe  Group  undertakes  certain  promotional  campaigns  offering reduced-interest customer credit or discounts on services. Because these are sales incentives, the cost of these operations is recognized as a reduction in sales by the Automotive segments when the vehicle sale takes place and is not spread over the duration of the financing or the services concerned.\n\n## WARRANTY\n\nThe  Group  makes  a  distinction  between  insurance-type  warranties and service-type warranties. Provisions are established for insurance-type warranties, while service-type warranties give rise to revenue that is spread over the duration of the warranty extension.\n\nThe estimated or incurred costs relating to manufacturer's product or  part  warranties  classified  as  insurance-type  warranties  are charged  to  expenses  when  the  sales  are  recorded.  Provisions  for costs  to  be  borne  by  Renault  are  valued  on  the  basis  of  observed data  by  model  and  engine, i.e. the  level  of  costs,  and  their distribution  over  the  periods  covered  by  the  manufacturer's\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nwarranty.  In  the  event  of  product  recalls  following  incidents  that come  to  light  after  the  vehicle  has  been  put  on  the  market, provisions are established to cover the costs involved as soon as the decision to undertake the recall campaign has been made. Amounts claimed  from  suppliers  are  deducted  from  the  warranty  expense when it is considered practically certain they will be recovered.\n\n## SERVICES RELATED TO SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS\n\nRevenues from service contracts sold by the Group are recognized on a  percentage-of-completion  basis.  These  contracts  may  be  for warranty extensions, maintenance or insurance.\n\nSuch service contracts may be sold separately to the final customer or included free of charge in a sale package covering a vehicle and related services. In either case, the Group considers service contracts as  a  separate  service  obligation  from  delivery  of  the  vehicle  and allocates a portion of revenues to the service contract.\n\nWhen  the  customer  makes  regular  payments  for  the  service contract, the revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis. When the  contract  is  prepaid  (for  example,  when  it  is  paid  for  by  the customer at the time of the vehicle purchase), the amounts received are recorded as deferred income, and spread over the duration of the contract,  on  a  straight-line  basis  for  warranty  extensions  and following an experience curve for maintenance contracts.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES\n\nImpairment  is  booked  in  respect  of  the  Automotive  segment's customer  receivables  to  reflect  the  prospective  assessment  of  the credit risk at the inception of the receivable and any deterioration of that risk over time. When there is an incurred credit loss, impairment is recorded individually for each receivable.\n\n## Sales Financing revenues SALES FINANCING REVENUES\n\nSales Financing revenues are generated by financing operations for sales  of  vehicles  to  dealers  and  end-users.  These  financing operations take the form of loans from the Sales Financing segment companies  and  are  carried  in  the  balance  sheet  at  amortized  cost under  the  effective  interest  rate  method,  less  any  impairment. Income  on  these  contracts  is  calculated  so  as  to  give  a  constant interest rate over the period and is included in sales revenues.\n\n## SALES FINANCING COSTS\n\nSales  financing  costs  are  considered  as  operating  expenses  and included  in  the  operating  income  (operating  margin  in  the information  by  operating  segment).  They  mainly  comprise  interest incurred  by  sales  financing  companies  to  refinance  their  customer loan  transactions,  other  costs  and  revenues  directly  related  to administration  of  this  type  of  refinancing  (temporary  investments, hedging and management of exchange and interest rate risks), and the  cost  of  risks  related  to  receivables.  Refinancing  comes  from diversified sources: public and private bond issues, public and private securitization  backed  by  Automotive  segments  loans,  negotiable debt  instruments,  savings  collected  and  financing  from  credit institutions and assimilates.\n\nI\n\n04",

For healthy receivables (stage 1), impairment is equivalent to the 12-month expected credit loss; for receivables on which  the  credit  risk  has  significantly  deteriorated  since  initial recognition  or  which  received  extensions  during  the  lockdown (stage 2),  impairment  is  equivalent  to  the  lifetime  expected  losses; and for receivables in default (stage 3), impairment is equivalent to the incurred credit loss.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  uses  an  internal  scoring  system  or external ratings to identify any significant deterioration in the credit risk.  In  addition,  this  segment  has  decided  to  use  the  assumptions set  out  in  the  standard  and  thus  downgrades  any  receivable outstanding  after  30  days  to  stage 2,  and  any  receivable  still outstanding after 90 days to stage 3.\n\nThe Sales Financing segment refers to the current recommendations of  the  Basel  Committee  to  generate  the  parameters  needed  to calculate the probability of default and the loss rates in the event of default on loans and financing, finance lease receivables, irrevocable financing commitments, and financial guarantees given to customers  and  dealers  in  its  principal  countries  of  business (Germany,  Brazil,  Spain,  France,  Italy  and  the  United  Kingdom  for customer and dealer financing, Korea for customer financing only). These  assets  account  for  more  than  85%  of  financial  assets.  For other assets, a standard approach based on a simplified methodology is applied.\n\nAs the assumptions used are essentially based on observable market data, the calculation of impairment for expected credit losses in the Sales Financing segment also incorporates forward-looking macro-economic data (GDP, long-term rates, etc. ) to reflect changes in indicators and sector-specific information.\n\n## WRITE-OFF RULES\n\nThe gross book value of a financial asset is written off when there are no reasonable expectations of recovery. The asset is derecognized  via  a  loss  account,  and  the  associated  impairment  is reversed when the non-recoverability of receivables is confirmed, or at the latest when the Sales Financing segment's rights as creditor are extinguished. Examples of receivables that become non-recoverable and are derecognized are waivers negotiated with customers  (notably  as  part  of  a  recovery  plan),  time-barred receivables, receivables concerned by an unfavorable legal judgment (when  the  outcome  of  a  lawsuit  or  litigation  is  negative),  and receivables owed by a customer that no longer exists.\n\n## Financial income (expenses) 2 - H -\n\nThe cost of net financial  indebtedness comprises the cost of gross financial  indebtedness  less  income  associated  with  cash,  cash equivalents  and  financial  assets  of  the  Automotive  segments.  The\n\nI\n\ncost of gross financial indebtedness consists of income and expenses generated  by  the  Automotive  segments'  financial  indebtedness during the period, including the impact of the effective portion of the related interest rate hedges.\n\nOther  financial  income  and  expenses  mainly  include  foreign exchange gains and losses on financial items and related hedges, the gain or loss caused by exposure to hyperinflation (note 2-E), the net interest on provisions for pensions, and dividends and impairment of companies that are neither controlled nor under significant influence by the Group.\n\n## Income tax 2 - I -\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  deferred  taxes  for  all  temporary  differences between  the  tax  and  book  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  the consolidated  statement  of  financial  position.  Deferred  taxes  are calculated  at  the  latest  tax  rate  enacted  at  the  closing  date applicable  to  the  period  when  temporary  differences  are  reversed. Each individual fiscal entity (legal entity, establishment or group of entities that pays tax to the tax administration) that is authorized to offset its current tax assets and liabilities reports deferred tax assets and liabilities net. Recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the probability of future recovery.\n\nFor associates and joint ventures, a deferred tax liability on dividend distributions  is  booked  for  all  differences  between  the  book  value and tax value of shares held.\n\nTax  credits  that  can  only  be  used  against  a  taxable  profit  are recorded  as  a  deduction  from  the  income  tax  payable.  Tax  credits that  are  recoverable  regardless  of  whether  the  Company  makes  a taxable profit are set against the relevant nature of expense.\n\nTo  determine  the  provisions  for  uncertain  tax  liabilities,  the  Group uses  a  case-by-case  method  based  on  the  most  probable  value.  In view of their qualitative characteristics these provisions are reported on specific lines in the consolidated financial position.\n\n## Goodwill 2 - J -\n\nNon-controlling  interests  (formerly  called  'minority  interests')  are carried at fair value (the full goodwill method) or at their share in the fair  value  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  transferred  (the  partial goodwill  method).  To  date,  Renault  has  only  recognized  goodwill valued  under  the  partial  goodwill  method.  The  choice  of  which method to use is made for each individual case.\n\nGoodwill  is  not  amortized,  but  impairment  tests  are  carried  out  at least annually or whenever there is evidence of loss of value. After initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  stated  at  cost  less  any  accumulated impairment.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the value  of  the  entities  concerned  as  reported  in  the  assets  in  the statement  of  financial  position.  In  the  event  of  impairment,  an impairment loss is booked and included in the consolidated income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.",

The positive or negative difference between the cost of acquiring shares and the book value of the non-controlling interests acquired is recorded in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Research and development expenses and 2 - K other intangible assets\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\n\nDevelopment  expenses  incurred  between  the  decision  to  begin development and implement production facilities for a new vehicle or component ( e.g. engine or gearbox) and the subsequent approval of  the  design  for  mass  production  are  capitalized  as  intangible assets. They are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date of approval for production, over the expected market life of the vehicle or part, which is initially no longer than seven years. Market lives are regularly reviewed and subsequently adjusted if there is a significant difference  from  the  initial  estimate.  Capitalized  development expenses mainly comprise the cost of prototypes, the cost of studies invoiced  by  external  firms,  the  cost  of  personnel  assigned  to  the project and  a  share  of  overheads  dedicated  exclusively  to development activities.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the development of a project requiring  at  least  12 months  of  preparation  before  commissioning are  included  in  the  gross  value  of  the  asset,  which  is  a  'qualifying asset'.  The  capitalization  rate  for  borrowing  costs  is  limited  such that capitalized borrowing costs do not exceed the total borrowing costs  borne  during  the  year.  When  a  project  is  financed  through  a specific borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nExpenses incurred before the decision to begin product development are  recorded  as  costs  in  the  period  they  are  incurred,  in  the  same way as research expenses. Expenses incurred after the start of mass production are treated as production costs.\n\n## OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nOther intangible assets comprise patents, leasehold rights, intangible  business  assets,  licenses,  software,  brands  and  similar rights purchased by the Group. When they have a finite useful life, patents,  leasehold  rights,  licenses,  brands  and  similar  rights purchased are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of protection stipulated by the contract or the law, or over the useful life if shorter. Intangible business assets and software are amortized over their useful life. The useful life of intangible assets is generally between  three  and  five years.  Intangible  assets  with  an  indefinite useful life, such as the LADA brand (note 11-C), are subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and when there is any indication of impairment.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment and 2 - L right-of-use assets\n\nThe  gross  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  corresponds  to historical acquisition or production cost.\n\nDesign  and  preparation  expenses  are  included  in  the  asset's production cost.\n\nThe production cost for property, plant and equipment also includes financing costs borne during the construction phase, under the same\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nmethod as for intangible assets. When a project is financed through a  specific  borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nInvestment subsidies received are deducted from the gross value of the assets concerned.\n\nSubsequent  expenses  for  property,  plant  and  equipment,  except those incurred to increase productivity or prolong the life of an asset, are charged to expenses as incurred.\n\nAssets  leased  to  customers  include  vehicles  leased  for  more  than one  year  from  a  Group  finance  company  with  a  buyback commitment by the  Group,  and  vehicles  sold  under  an  agreement including  a  clause  for  buyback  after  a  minimum  one  year  of  use. Assets leased to customers also include batteries leased to electric vehicle users by Group finance companies (note 2-G).\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe  Group  is  a  party  to  leases  of  real  estate  property  (land, concessions, warehouses, offices, etc. ) and movable property (IT and operating equipment, transport equipment).\n\nA contract contains a lease if it gives the lessee the right to use an identified  asset  for  a  specified  period  of  time  in  exchange  for payment.\n\nAt the contract's commencement date, a lessee recognizes an asset related to the right of use, and a financial liability that represents the lease obligation. The right-of-use asset is amortized over the term of the  lease.  The  lease  liability  is  initially  recognized  at  the  present value  of  lease  payments  over  the  expected  term  of  the  lease.  The discount  is  unwound  using  the  implicit  interest  rate  of  the  lease agreement  if  it  can  be  readily  determined,  or  at  the  incremental borrowing rate otherwise. As lessee, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate, calculated for  each  monetary  zone  as  the  risk-free rate  applicable  in  the  zone,  plus  the  Group's  risk  premium  for  the local  currency.  In  the  income  statement,  amortization  of  the right-of-use  asset  is  recorded  in  the  operating  income  (operating margin  in  the  information  by  operating  segment)  and  a  financial expense  corresponding  to  the  interest  on  the  lease  liability  is recorded  in  financial  income  and  expenses,  replacing  the  lease payments  previously  charged  to  the  operating  margin.  The  tax impact  of  this  consolidation  adjustment  is  recognized  via  deferred taxes.  In  the  cash  flow  statement,  cash  flows  from  operating activities  are  impacted  by  interest  expenses  paid,  and  cash  flows from  financing  activities  are  impacted  by  the  reimbursed  lease liability.\n\nLease payments on short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are treated as operating expenses and amortized on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe  term  of  the  lease  is  the  non-cancellable  period  of  a  lease contract  during  which  the  lessee  has  the  right  to  use  the  leased asset,  extended  by  any  renewal  options  the  Group  is  reasonably certain to exercise. For French commercial leases, the lease term is generally  nine years.  Last  term  estimation  and  consideration  of extension and termination options is conducted with the help of the Real  Estate  department,  considering  the  types  of  site  and  their development plans.\n\nI\n\n04",

The corresponding liability is considered as a financial liability under IFRS 9, and the asset as a tangible asset in compliance with IAS 16.\n\nProvisions for repairs required contractually by lessors are recognized at the start of the lease, with a corresponding tangible asset.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nIn  the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  and  the  Sales Financing  segment,  depreciation  is  calculated  on  a  straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n| Buildings  (1)                                     | 15 to 30 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Specific tools                                     | 2 to 7 years     |\n| Machinery and other tools (other than press lines) | 5 to 15 years    |\n| Press lines and stamping installations             | 20 to 30 years   |\n| Other tangible assets  (2)                         | 4 to 6 years     |\n\n- Buildings in use before 1987 are depreciated over a period of up to 40 years. (1)\n- Except for leased batteries, which are depreciated over periods of 8 to 10 years (2) depending on the models.\n\nUseful lives are regularly reviewed, and accelerated depreciation is recorded  when  an  asset's  useful  life  becomes  shorter  than  the initially  expected  period  of  use,  particularly  when  it  is  decided  to withdraw a vehicle or component from the market.\n\nDepreciation  for  the  AVTOVAZ  segment  is  calculated  on  a straight-line  basis  over  useful  lives  that  may  be  longer  than  those used in other Groupe Renault companies.\n\n## Impairment 2 - M -/uni00A0\n\n## Impairment of fixed assets (other than leased assets)\n\nFixed  assets  are  subjected  to  impairment  tests  as  soon  as  there  is any indication of a loss of value, such as significant adverse changes in the market in which the Company operates, or changes affecting the circumstances and manner of use of the assets.\n\nFor  the Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment ,  impairment tests are carried out at two levels:\n\n## AT THE LEVEL OF VEHICLE-SPECIFIC ASSETS (INCLUDING COMPONENTS)\n\nVehicle-specific assets (including components) consist of capitalized development expenses and tools. Impairment tests are carried out by comparing the net book value of the assets with the recoverable value,  calculated  based  on  discounted  future  cash  flows  related  to the vehicle and its components. These assets may be specific to the model and/or the country of destination.\n\nI\n\n## AT THE LEVEL OF CASH-GENERATING UNITS\n\nA  cash-generating  unit  is  defined  as  a  coherent  subset  that generates  largely  independent  cash  flows.  Other  cash-generating units may represent an economic entity (plant or subsidiary) or the whole Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment. Net fixed assets related  to  cash-generating  units  notably  include  goodwill,  specific assets and capacity assets, and components of working capital.\n\nFor  each  of  the  two  levels,  impairment  tests  are  carried  out  by comparing  the  net  book  value  with  the  recoverable  value. Recoverable  value  is  defined  as  the  higher  of  value  in  use  or  fair value less selling costs.\n\nValue  in  use  is  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows expected to arise from the use of an asset. Future cash flows derive from the business plan drawn up and validated by the Management, plus  a  terminal  value  based  on  discounted  normative  cash  flows after  application  of  a  growth  rate  to  infinity.  They  also  include  a bonus  ('excess  earnings')  paid  to  the  Automotive  segments  for business referrals to the Sales Financing segment. The assumptions underlying the business plan include estimates of market developments in countries in which the Group operates and its share of  those  markets,  changes  in  the  sale  price  of  products  and  the prices  of  purchased  components  and  commodities.  The  pre-tax discount  rate  used  is  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  as determined by the Company.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  value  is  lower  than  the  net  book  value, impairment  equivalent  to  the  difference  is  recorded  against  the assets concerned.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment , an impairment test is carried out at  least  once  a  year  or  whenever  there  is  an  indication  of  loss  of value, by comparing the book value and recoverable value of assets. Recoverable value is defined as the higher of fair value (less selling costs)  and  value  in  use.  The  value  in  use  is  based  on  a  market approach,  determined  by  using  multiples  for  each  group  of cash-generating  units  made  up  of  legal  entities  or  groups  of  legal entities in the same country. The same discount rate is used for all cash-generating  units  tested:  a  risk-free  10-year  rate  increased  by the average risk premium for the sector in which the cash-generating units operate. The forecast horizon for income and losses is one year.\n\nFor AVTOVAZ ,  impairment  tests  are  also  carried  out  at  different levels  (on  specific  assets,  on  the  Lada  brand,  and  on  the  whole Group).  The  AVTOVAZ  Group  as  a  whole  is  considered  as  one cash-generating  unit,  and  no  tests  are  conducted  for  individual factories or economic entities.\n\n## Impairment of investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nImpairment tests of the value of investments in associates and joint ventures are carried out as soon as there is any indication of a loss of value,  essentially  significant  adverse  changes  in  the  markets  in which  the  Company  operates,  or  a  major  or  long-term  decline  in stock market value.",

        "page_content": "Impairment  tests  are  carried  out  in  compliance  with  IAS 28  and IAS 36,  by  comparing  the  book  value  of  the  investment  in  the associate  or  joint  venture  with  the  recoverable  value,  which  is  the higher of value in use and fair value, less selling costs. The value in use  is  equal  to  the  share  of  the  present  value  of  future  estimated cash flows expected by the associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture is listed, the fair value is its stock market value.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  value  is  lower  than  the  book  value, impairment  equivalent  to  the  difference  is  recorded  against  the relevant investment in an associate or joint venture, and included in the Group's income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Non-current assets or groups of assets held 2 - N for sale\n\nAssets held for sale are non-current assets or groups of assets that are available for immediate sale and have a high probability of being sold.\n\nNon-current assets or groups of assets considered to be held for sale are  measured  and  recorded  at  the  lower  of  net  book  value  or  fair value less selling costs. No further amortization is recorded once an asset is  classified  as  held  for  sale  (or  included  in  a  group  of  assets held  for  sale).  These  assets  are  reported  on  a  specific  line  of  the consolidated financial position.\n\n## Inventories 2 - O -\n\nInventories  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable  value. Cost  corresponds  to  acquisition  cost  or  production  cost,  which includes  direct  and  indirect  production  expenses  and  a  share  of manufacturing overheads, based on a forecast level of activity, and the results of any related hedges. The level of activity is forecast site by site, in order to determine the share of fixed costs to be excluded if the actual level of activity is lower.\n\nInventories  of  the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  and the Sales Financing segment are valued under the FIFO (First In First Out)  method.  Inventories  of  AVTOVAZ  are  valued  at  weighted average cost.\n\nWhen  the  net  realizable  value  is  lower  than  the  financial  position value, impairment equal to the difference is recorded.\n\n## Assignment of receivables and reverse 2 - P factoring\n\nReceivables  assigned  to  third  parties  (through  securitization, discounting, or factoring) are removed from Group assets when the associated risks and benefits are also substantially transferred to the third parties in question. Risk analysis principally concerns the credit risk,  the  risk  of  late  payment  and  the  country  risk.  The  same  rule applies  in  the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  and  the Sales Financing segment.\n\nThe Automotive segments participate in reverse-factoring programs. These programs can be used to support a supplier, or to benefit the Group by extending payment deadlines. In the first case, the liability continues  to  be  considered  as  part  of  the  operating  cycle  and  the amounts  concerned  remain  in  trade  payables  in  the  financial\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nposition.  In  the  second  case,  if  the  reverse  factoring  contract includes  an  unconditional  commitment  by  the  Group  to  pay  the amount initially due to the supplier to the financial institution that is a party to the contract, the liability is no longer considered as part of the  operating  cycle  and  the  amounts  concerned  are  reclassified  as financial liabilities (this has no impact on the cash flow statement at the reclassification date).\n\nIf  the  contract  is  considered  as  a  financial  liability  and  covers  a financing  requirement  for  the  Group  subsidiary  involved,  the repayments  to  financial  institutions  impact  cash  flows  from financing activities in the cash flow statement; otherwise, they are included in cash flows from operating activities.\n\n## Treasury shares 2 - Q -\n\nTreasury  shares  are  shares  held  for  the  purposes  of  stock  option plans,  performance  share  plans  and  other  share-based  payment arrangements awarded to Group managers and executives.\n\nThey  are  recorded  at  acquisition  cost  and  deducted  from  Group shareholders' equity until the date of sale.\n\nWhen  these  shares  are  sold,  the  sale  price  is  directly  included  in consolidated shareholders' equity. Consequently, no gain or loss on treasury shares is included in the net income for the period.\n\n## Stock option plans/Performance share 2 - R attribution plans and other share-based payments agreements\n\nThe Group awards stock option plans, performance share attribution plans and other share-based payments, all for Renault shares. The grant  date  is  the  date  at  which  beneficiaries  are  informed  of  the decision  to  grant  these  options  or  performance  shares,  and  the terms  of  the  relevant  plans.  For  plans  subject  to  performance conditions, an estimate of achievement of those conditions is taken into  account  in  determining  the  number  of  options  or  shares attributed. This estimate is reviewed annually based on changes in the probability of performance condition achievement. The final fair value  of  services  rendered  in  return  for  attribution  of  options  or shares is measured by reference to the fair value of those options or shares  at  their  grant  date,  using  a  suitable  binomial  mathematical model  that  assumes  exercise  of  the  options  is  spread  over  the exercise period on a straight-line basis. Entitlements to attribution of performance shares are valued based on the share value at grant date  less  dividends  expected  during  the  vesting  period.  Where relevant, a discount is applied to reflect the fact that the shares must be held for a certain period. The share price volatility factor applied is implicit volatility at the grant date. The expected dividend used is determined by reference to the dividend payout schedule announced at the time each plan is valued.\n\nThe total fair value calculated in this way is spread on a straight-line basis  over  the  vesting  period  for  the  relevant  plan.  The  cost  is included in personnel expenses, with a corresponding adjustment to consolidated  reserves.  When  the  option  is  exercised,  the  cash amount received by the Group in settlement of the exercise price is booked  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  with  a  corresponding adjustment to consolidated reserves.\n\nI\n\n04",

Under  this  method,  benefits  are attributed  to  periods  of  service  according  to  the  plan's  benefit formula, principally on a straight-line basis over the years of service.\n\nThe  future  payments  for  employee  benefits  are  measured  on  the basis of future salary increases, retirement age, mortality and length of  employment  with  the  Company,  and  are  discounted  at  a  rate determined  by  reference  to  yields  on  long-term  high  quality corporate  bonds  of  a  duration  corresponding  to  the  estimated average duration of the benefit plan concerned.\n\nThe  actuarial  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  revisions  of  the underlying  assumptions  and  experience-based  adjustments  are included in other components of comprehensive income.\n\nThe  net  expense  for  the  year,  corresponding  to  the  current  period service cost plus the past service cost where relevant, is charged to the  operating  income  (operating  margin  in  the  information  by operating segment). The interest expense on the net defined-benefit liability (asset) is recorded in the net financial income and expenses\n\n## Workforce adjustment measures 2 - T -\n\nThe  estimated  cost  of  workforce  adjustment  measures,  which  for accounting purposes is treated as an employee benefit, is covered by a  provision  over  the  estimated  residual  employment  period  of  the employees concerned.\n\nThe  cost  of  termination  indemnities  is  recognized  as  soon  as  a detailed  plan  has  either  been  announced  or  is  in  progress.  The amount recorded is net of existing provisions for pensions.\n\n## Financial assets 2 - U -\n\nThe Group recognizes a financial asset when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument.\n\nFinancial assets comprise investments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not exercise significant influence, marketable securities, negotiable debt instruments, loans, and derivative assets related to financial transactions (note 2-X).\n\nThese instruments are presented as non-current assets, apart from those  maturing  within  12 months  of  the  closing  date,  which  are classified as current assets.\n\n## Investments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not have significant influence\n\nInvestments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not have significant influence are classified as equity instruments at fair value through profit and loss. The fair values of such financial assets are determined in priority by reference to the market price. If this is\n\nI\n\nnot possible, the Group uses a valuation method that is not based on market data.\n\nIn  an  exception  to  this  rule,  the  Group  has  made  an  irrevocable option  to  present  the  Daimler  shares  at  fair  value  through  Other components of comprehensive income.\n\n## Marketable securities and negotiable debt instruments\n\nShort-term  investments  in  the  form  of  marketable  securities  and negotiable debt instruments are undertaken for the management of cash surpluses, but do not meet the requirements to qualify as cash equivalents. These are debt instruments carried at fair value through other  components  of  comprehensive  income,  except  for  shares  in investment  funds  (UCITS)  which  are  carried  at  fair  value  through profit and loss.\n\nImpairment  equivalent  to  expected  credit  losses  is  booked  upon initial  recognition of debt instruments carried at fair value through other components of comprehensive income.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans essentially include loans for investment of cash surpluses and loans to associates.\n\nLoans  are  carried  at  amortized  cost.  Impairment  equivalent  to expected  credit  losses  is  recognized  upon  initial  recognition  of  the financial asset, and when there is objective evidence of loss of value caused by an event arising after the initial recognition.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents 2 - V -\n\nCash  includes  cash  on  hand,  current  accounts  and  other  demand deposits, with the exception of bank overdrafts, which are included in financial liabilities. These instruments are stated at amortized cost except for shares in investment funds (UCITS) which are carried at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nCash equivalents  are  investments  held  for  the  purpose  of  meeting short-term  cash  commitments.  For  an  investment  to  qualify  as  a cash  equivalent,  it  must  be  considered  as  liquid,  be  readily convertible  for  a  known  amount  of  cash  and  be  subject  to  an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\nBank  accounts  subject  to  restrictions  due  to  sector-specific regulations (for example, banking or insurance regulations) or bank accounts allocated to increasing credit on securitized receivables are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Financial liabilities of the Automotive 2 - W segments and Sales Financing debts\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  financial  liability  (for  the  Automotive segments) or a Sales Financing debt when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument.\n\nFinancial liabilities and Sales Financing debts comprise redeemable shares, bonds, other debts represented by a certificate, borrowings from  credit  institutions,  lease  liabilities  in  application  of  IFRS 16 (note 2-L), other interest-bearing borrowings and derivative liabilities related to financial transactions (note 2-X).",

        "page_content": "Redeemable  shares  are  listed  subordinated  debt  instruments  that earn  a  variable  return  indexed  on  consolidated  revenues.  They  are carried  at  amortized  cost,  determined  by  discounting  forecast coupons  using  the  effective  interest  rate  on  borrowings.  The estimated  effective  interest  rate  takes  account  of  indexation,  and the amortized cost recorded in financial result is re-estimated when there  is  a  significant  change  in  future  sales  prospects,  particularly when medium-term business plans are released.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  not  concerned  by  specific  hedge  accounting methods (note 2-X) are generally recorded at amortized cost using the  effective  interest  rate  method.  financial  expense  calculated  in this  way  includes  issuance  expenses  and  issuance  or  redemption premiums, together with the impact of debt renegotiations when the old and new terms are not substantially different.\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting 2 - X -\n\n## Measurement and presentation\n\nDerivatives  are  initially  stated  at  fair  value.  This  fair  value  is subsequently reviewed at each closing date:\n\n- the fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency swaps is P determined by discounting future cash flows,  using  closing-date market rates (exchange and interest rates);\n- the fair value of interest rate derivatives is the amount the Group P would  receive  (or  pay)  to  settle  outstanding  contracts  at  the closing date, taking into account interest rates forward curves and the  quality  of  the  counterparty  to  each  contract  at  the  closing date. This fair value includes accrued interest;\n- the  fair  value  of  commodity  derivatives  is  based  on  market P conditions.\n\nThe Automotive segments' derivatives are reported in the financial position as current if they mature within 12 months and non-current otherwise.  All  Sales  Financing  segment  derivatives  are  reported  in the financial position as current.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe  treatment  of  derivatives  designated  as  hedging  instruments depends on the type of hedging relationship:\n\n- fair value hedge; P\n- cash flow hedge; P\n- hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. P\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Group identifies the hedging instrument and the hedged item as soon  as  the  hedge  is  set  up,  and  documents  the  hedging relationship,  stating  the  hedging  strategy,  the  risk  hedged  and  the method  used  to  assess  the  hedge's  effectiveness.  The  Sales Financing segment documents hedging relationships concerning one or more homogeneous items to cover its risks. This documentation is subsequently updated such that the effectiveness of the designated hedge can be demonstrated.\n\nHedge  accounting  uses  specific  measurement  and  recognition methods for each category of hedge:\n\n- fair value hedges: the hedged item is adjusted to fair value up to P the  risk  hedged  and  the  hedging  instrument  is  recorded  at  fair value.  As  changes  in  these  items  are  recorded  in  the  income statement  simultaneously,  only  the  ineffective  portion  of  the hedge  has  an  impact  on  net  income.  It  is  recorded  in  the  same income statement item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument;\n- cash  flow  hedges:  no  adjustment  is  made  to  the  value  of  the P hedged item; only the hedging instrument is adjusted to fair value. Following this adjustment, the effective portion of the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk is recorded, net of taxes, in other  components  of  comprehensive  income,  while  the ineffective  portion  is  included  in  net  income.  The  cumulative amount  included  in  shareholders'  equity  is  transferred  to  the income statement when the hedged item has an impact on net income;\n- hedge  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the  hedging P instrument is adjusted to fair value. Following this adjustment, the effective  portion  of  the  change  in  fair  value  attributable  to  the hedged  exchange  risk  is  recorded,  net  of  taxes,  in  other components  of  comprehensive  income,  while  the  ineffective portion  is  included  in  net  income.  The  cumulative  amount included  in  shareholders'  equity  is  transferred  to  net  income  at the date of liquidation or sale of the investment. The interest rate component of borrowings in yen used to hedge the investment in Nissan  is  considered  as  the  ineffective  portion,  and  is  therefore recorded directly in financial income and expenses.\n\n## Derivatives not designated as hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized  directly  in  financial  income,  except  in  the  case  of derivatives  entered  into  exclusively  for  reasons  closely  related  to business  operations.  In  this  case,  changes  in  the  fair  value  of derivatives are included in the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment).\n\nI\n\n04",

This  agreement  lays  down the  conditions  for  a  new  outplacement  policy,  and  includes  a  new voluntary work-exemption plan in 2021, which eligible personnel can join  between  February 1  and  December 1,  2021,  and  a  Collective Contractual  Separation  plan  for  a  maximum  1,900  employee departures. Restructuring provisions were recorded at December 31, 2020  of  -\u20ac70  million  for  the  new  voluntary  work-exemption  plan, and -\u20ac197 million for the Collective Contractual Separation plan.\n\nRestructuring  costs  and  provisions  for  the  rest  of  the  world  at December 31, 2020 include restructuring costs of -\u20ac218 million. The principal  countries  concerned  are  Argentina  (restructuring  costs  of -\u20ac37  million),  Spain  (restructuring  costs  of  -\u20ac26  million),  Romania (restructuring  costs  of  -\u20ac21  million),  AVTOVAZ  (restructuring  costs of  -\u20ac21  million),  Morocco  (restructuring  costs  of  -\u20ac17  million),  and Brazil (restructuring costs of -\u20ac15 million).\n\nA restructuring plan was announced in South Korea on January 20, 2021. This plan will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements, in accordance with the IAS 37 rules for restructuring provisions.\n\nIn  2019,  restructuring  costs  mainly  included  -\u20ac89  million  of complementary  expenses  following  revision  of  the  assumptions  to reflect the higher than anticipated numbers signing up to the French career-end  work  exemption  plan  set  out  in  the  initial  agreement named  'Renault  France  CAP  2020  Contrat  d'Activit\u00e9  pour  une Performance durable ' (activity contract for sustainable performance), signed on January 13, 2017 and amended on April 16, 2018.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A07\n\n## FINANCIAL INCOME (EXPENSES)\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                                                                                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of gross financial indebtedness                                                                                                           | (355)  | (386)  |\n| Income on cash and financial assets                                                                                                            | 18     | 75     |\n| COST OF NET FINANCIAL INDEBTEDNESS                                                                                                             | (337)  | (311)  |\n| Dividends received from companies that are neither controlled nor under significant influence                                                  | 16     | 59     |\n| Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial operations                                                                                      | 41     | 30     |\n| Gain/Loss on exposure to hyperinflation                                                                                                        | (40)   | (34)   |\n| Net interest expenses on the defined-benefit liabilities and assets corresponding to pension and other long-term employee  benefit obligations | (16)   | (28)   |\n| Other*                                                                                                                                         | (146)  | (158)  |\n| OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES                                                                                                            | (145)  | (131)  |\n| FINANCIAL INCOME (EXPENSE)                                                                                                                     | (482)  | (442)  |\n\n- Other items mainly comprise expenses on assignment of receivables, changes in fair value (the investments in FAA and Partech Growth), bank commissions, discounts and * late payment interest.\n- At December 31, 2020, other items also include the effects of adjustment to amortized cost of the State-guaranteed credit facility (-\u20ac69 million) and redeemable shares (+\u20ac41 million) (note 23 C).\n\nThe net cash position (or net financial indebtedness) of the Automotive segments is presented in the information by operating segment (see section 4.2.6.1 - A4).\n\nI\n\n## Gains and losses on disposal of businesses 6 - B or/uni00A0operating entities\n\nIn 2020, costs associated with the sale of Renault's share in the joint venture  DRAC  and  the  takeover  of  the  after-sales  activity  were recognized in the total amount of -\u20ac172 million.\n\n## Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill 6 - C (excluding goodwill of associates and joint ventures)\n\nImpairment  net  of  reversals  amounts  to  -\u20ac762  million  at December 31, 2020 (-\u20ac229 million in 2019). The new impairment was principally  recorded  as  a  result  of  impairment  tests  on  petrol  and diesel  engine  vehicles  given  the  lower  sales  volumes  in  2020,  the downward revision  of  business  prospects  in  view  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic, and the assumptions used in the medium-term plan for the period 2021-2025 presented in January 2021.\n\nNo  reversal  of  impairment  was  recorded  in  2020  (\u20ac10 million  of reversals were recognized in 2019).\n\nIn  2020,  impairment  concerns  intangible  assets  (net  increase  of -\u20ac565  million,  compared  to  -\u20ac201  million  in  2019)  and  property, plant  and  equipment  (net  increase  of  -\u20ac197  million,  compared  to -\u20ac28 million in 2019 (notes 10 and 11)).\n\n## Other unusual items 6 - D -\n\nImpairment  tests  on  certain  vehicles  led  to  the  recognition  of unusual expenses corresponding to advance and future payments to partners and suppliers in connection with those vehicles, amounting to -\u20ac75 million in 2020 and -\u20ac78 million in 2019.\n\nBusiness  activity  in  Algeria  was  halted  in  early  2020  following government decisions, notably concerning authorizations to import parts  necessary  for  production,  and  it  is  not  possible  to  determine when  this  activity  might  resume.  Certain  assets  (receivables, inventories, etc .)  associated  with  the  business  have  consequently been  fully  written  off  for  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac99 million  in  2020. Moreover,  production  in  Algeria  is  carried  out  by  Renault  Alg\u00e9rie Production,  an  entity  accounted  for  by  the  equity  method  (see note 13-C).",

The decrease in the current income tax charge between 2019 and 2020 is due to the decrease in the business tax cotisation sur la valeur ajout\u00e9e des entreprises (CVAE) given that the taxable income is negative.\n\nIn 2020, -\u20ac263 million of the current income tax charge comes from foreign  entities  including  AVTOVAZ  (-\u20ac509  million  in  2019).  This charge decreased in 2020, largely due to the lower taxable income in certain subsidiaries.\n\nAn  analysis  of  the  recoverability  of  deferred  taxes  linked  to  the AVTOVAZ tax-loss carry  forwards  was  conducted  in  the  context  of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the significant deterioration in the  outlook  for  the  Russian  market,  these  assets  are  no  longer recognized. This has generated an additional deferred tax expense of -\u20ac248 million (-RUB 20,-510 million) in 2020.\n\nThe deferred tax charge for 2019 reflected the fact that recognition of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards under the French tax consolidation  system  had  been  discontinued  (with  an  effect  of -\u20ac753 million), mainly as there were no prospects of taxable income for  the  tax  consolidation  group  on  the  horizon  of  the  Drive  the Future plan.\n\n## Breakdown of the tax charge 8 - B -\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                               | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Income before taxes and share in net income of associates and joint ventures              | (2,481) | 1,663   |\n| Statutory income tax rate in France                                                       | 32.02%  | 34.43%  |\n| Theoretical tax income (charge)                                                           | 795     | (573)   |\n| Effect of differences between local tax rates and the French rate  (1)                    | 72      | 194     |\n| Tax credits                                                                               | 12      | 78      |\n| Distribution taxes                                                                        | 39      | (56)    |\n| Change in unrecognized deferred tax assets  (2)                                           | (721)   | (1,012) |\n| Other impacts  (3)                                                                        | (571)   | 8       |\n| Current and deferred tax income (charge) excluding taxes based on interim taxable profits | (374)   | (1,361) |\n| Taxes based on interim taxable profits  (4)                                               | (46)    | (93)    |\n| Current and deferred tax income (charge)                                                  | (420)   | (1,454) |\n\n- The main contributors to the tax rate differential are Romania, United Kingdom, Russia, Switzerland and Turkey. (1)\n- In 2020, other impacts mainly the effects on deferred taxes of the lower income tax rates applicable to entities in the French tax consolidation group. (3)\n- The deferred tax charge for 2020 includes the effect of discontinued recognition of deferred tax assets on AVTOVAZ tax loss carryforwards, and 2019 includes the effect of (2) discontinued recognition of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards related to entities included in the French tax consolidation group (see note 8-A).\n- The Group's main taxes based on taxable profits are the CVAE in France and the IRAP in Italy. (4)\n\n## French tax consolidation group\n\nFor  the  French  tax  consolidation  group,  the  current  tax  charge amounts to  -\u20ac43  million,  principally  consisting  of  the  business  tax cotisation  sur  la  valeur  ajout\u00e9e  des  entreprises (CVAE),  and  the deferred  tax  gain  amounts  to  \u20ac176 million,  principally  due  to  the lower  deferred  tax  liabilities  on  capitalized  development  expenses following a decrease in the base and the tax rate for future years.\n\n## Entities not in the French tax consolidation group\n\nThe  tax  charge  for  non-French  entities  principally  reflects  the discontinuation  of  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  on  tax losses.\n\nExcluding  AVTOVAZ,  the  effective  tax  rate  for  these  entities  was 35% in 2020 (22% for 2019). The increase between 2019 and 2020 in the effective tax rate is mainly explained by the deficits reported in certain  subsidiaries,  particularly  in  Brazil  and  India,  without recognition of deferred tax assets on the taxable losses generated in 2020.\n\nI",

The  lower  level  of capitalized development expenses is notably attributable to deferral of  certain  technical  milestones  from  which  development  expenses are capitalized.\n\nAmortization was substantially higher in 2020 than 2019, due to the higher  level  of  capitalized  development  expenses  in  2018  and particularly in 2019.",

This  impairment  was  allocated  in priority  to  capitalized  development  expenses.  It  mainly  concerns petrol and diesel engine vehicles (including components) given the lower  sales  volumes  in  2020,  the  downward  revision  of  business prospects in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the assumptions used in the medium-term plan for the period 2021-2025 presented in January 2021. In 2019, impairment principally concerned vehicles made for the Chinese market, following a decline in sales volumes and the downward revision of Renault's prospects for those assets.\n\n## Impairment tests of country-specific assets 11 - B or/uni00A0cash-generating units of the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment\n\n## Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment\n\nThe recoverable value used for the purpose of impairment tests for the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  is  the  value  in  use, determined  under  the  discounted  future  cash  flow  method  on  the basis of the following assumptions:\n\n|                         | December 31,  2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Growth rate to infinity | 1.2%                 | 1.7%                |\n| After-tax discount rate | 9.2%                 | 8.5%                |\n\nThe assumptions used for impairment testing at December 31, 2020 are  derived  from  the  medium-term  plan  for  the  period  2021-2025 presented in January 2021. They include volume assumptions based on  unfavourable  market  trends,  mostly  caused  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic, with the return to pre-pandemic volume levels expected in  2024-2025  for  the  European  market,  and  2021  for  the  other Regions of the world where the Group has operations.\n\nThe growth rate to infinity used in the tests at December 31, 2020 includes the impacts of commitments made by the States that are signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nIn 2019, no impairment was recognized on assets of the Automotive (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  as  a  result  of  the  impairment  test, and it was considered that a reasonably possible change in the main assumptions  used  should  not  result  in  a  recoverable  value  lower than the book value of the assets tested.\n\nI\n\nAt  December 31,  2020,  no  reasonably  possible  change  in  the  main assumptions  used  should  result  in  a  recoverable  value  lower  than the  book  value  of  the  assets  tested.  The  recoverable  value  of  the assets tested would remain higher than the book value in the event of the following changes in those assumptions:\n\n- a growth rate to infinity of 0%; P\n- an after-tax discount rate of 10%. P\n\n## Impairment tests on the AVTOVAZ 11 - C cash-generating unit and the Lada brand\n\n## Impairment tests of the AVTOVAZ cash-generating unit\n\nAVTOVAZ  was  delisted  from  the  Moscow  Stock  exchange  in May 2019,  and  consequently  reference  is  no  longer  made  to  its market  capitalization  to  assess  the  recoverable  value  of  its  net assets,  including  goodwill  which  amounts  to  \u20ac678 million  (62,000 million roubles) at December 31, 2020\n\nIn application of the approach presented in the note on accounting policies (note 2-M to the consolidated financial statements for 2019), an  impairment  test  was  conducted  at  June 30,  2020  but  no impairment was recognized at that date as a result. A further test was  conducted  at  December 31,  2020  due  to  the  decline  of  the Russian market. The annual impairment test will now be conducted at December 31 every year.\n\nFor the impairment test of the AVTOVAZ cash-generating unit, the value  in  use  was  calculated  using  an  after-tax  discount  rate  of 14.7%,  an  assumption  that  volumes  would  return  to  their pre-pandemic levels in 2022, and a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 3.2%.\n\nThe  test  results  did  not  lead  to  recognition  of  any  impairment  at December 31,  2020.  A  decrease  of  more  than  32.3%  in  the profitability  assumptions  underlying  the  terminal  value  would  lead to recognition of impairment on goodwill, which has a book value of \u20ac678 million at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Impairment tests of the Lada brand\n\nFor the purpose of allocation of the purchase price of AVTOVAZ, the Lada brand was recognized at its fair value at the date control was acquired (in late 2016), i.e. 9,248 million Russian roubles (\u20ac101 million at the exchange rate of December 31, 2020). Since this brand  is  an  intangible  asset  with  an  indefinite  useful  life,  an impairment test was carried out at December 31, 2020 based on a discount  rate  of  14.7%  and  a  growth  rate  to  infinity  of  3.2%.  No impairment was booked in 2020, as the recoverable value was higher than the book value.\n\nA  reasonably  possible  change  in  the  key  assumptions  used  should not result in a recoverable value that is below the book value.\n\nThe annual impairment test will now be conducted at December 31 every year.",

The  Alliance  is organized so as to preserve individual brand identities and respect each company's corporate culture.\n\n## Consequently:\n\n- Renault is not assured of holding the majority of voting rights in P Nissan's Shareholders' Meeting;\n- the  terms  of  the  Renault-Nissan  agreements  do  not  entitle P Renault  to  appoint  the  majority  of  Nissan  directors,  nor  to  hold the  majority  of  voting  rights  at  meetings  of  Nissan's  Board  of Directors;  Renault  cannot  unilaterally  appoint  the  Chairman  of Nissan;\n- in  March 2019,  Renault,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  announced  the P creation of the new Alliance Board, a supervisory body to oversee Alliance operations and governance involving Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.  This  Board  has  four  members:  the  Chairman  of  the Board of Renault, the Chief Executive Officer of Renault, the Chief Executive  Officer  of  Nissan  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Mitsubishi Motors. Decisions are taken by consensus. In November 2019,  the  Board  added  the  post  of  Alliance  General Secretary, who reports to the Alliance Board and the CEOs of the three alliance companies;\n- at December 31, 2020, the Groupe Renault occupied two seats on P Nissan's Board of Directors and was represented by Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Chairman  of  the  Renault  Board  and Pierre Fleuriot, Lead Director in the Groupe Renault;\n- Renault can neither use nor influence the use of Nissan's assets in P the same way as its own assets;\n- Renault provides no guarantees in respect of Nissan's debt. P\n\nIn view of this situation, Renault is considered to exercise significant influence  over  Nissan,  and  therefore  uses  the  equity  method  to include its investment in Nissan in the consolidation.\n\n## Nissan consolidated financial statements 12 - B included under the equity method in the Renault consolidation\n\nThe Nissan accounts included under the equity method in Renault's financial statements are Nissan's consolidated accounts published in compliance with Japanese accounting standards (as Nissan is listed on the Tokyo  Stock  exchange),  after adjustments  for the requirements of the Renault consolidation.\n\nNissan  publishes  consolidated  financial  statements  quarterly,  and annually at March 31. For the purposes of the Renault consolidation, Nissan's results are included in line with the Renault calendar (the results for the period January through December are consolidated in Renault's annual financial statements).\n\nNissan held 0.7% of its own treasury shares at December 31, 2020 (0.7%  at  December 31,  2019).  Consequently,  Renault's  percentage interest  in  Nissan  is  43.7%  (43.7%  at  December 31,  2019).  Renault holds 43.7% of voting rights in Nissan at September 30, 2020 (43.7% at September 30, 2019).\n\n## Changes in the investment in Nissan as shown in Renault's statement of financial position 12 - C -\n\n|                        | Share in net assets   | Share in net assets                                                | Share in net assets   |          |         |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|---------|\n| (\u20ac million)            | Before neutralization | Neutralization proportional to Nissan's investment in Renault  (1) | Net                   | Goodwill | Total   |\n| At December 31, 2019   | 20,837                | (974)                                                              | 19,863                | 759      | 20,622  |\n| 2020 net income  (3)   | (4,970)               | -                                                                  | (4,970)               | -        | (4,970) |\n| Dividend distributed   | -                     | -                                                                  | -                     | -        | -       |\n| Translation adjustment | (1,104)               | -                                                                  | (1,104)               | (27)     | (1,131) |\n| Other changes  (2)     | 97                    | -                                                                  | 97                    | -        | 97      |\n| At December 31, 2020   | 14,860                | (974)                                                              | 13,886                | 732      | 14,618  |\n\nI",

Details of this hedge are given in note 25-B2.\n\nAt  December 31,  2020,  the  corresponding  hedging  operations totaled  \u00a518 billion  (\u20ac145 million)  of  private  placements  in  bonds issued directly in yen on the Japanese Samurai bond market.\n\nIn  2020  these  operations  generated  foreign  exchange  differences that  offset  each  other  in  2020  (they  generated  an  unfavourable effect of -\u20ac70 million in 2019).\n\n## Valuation of Renault's investment in Nissan 12 - H at/uni00A0stock market prices\n\nBased on the quoted price at December 31, 2020 of \u00a5560 per share, Renault's investment  in Nissan is valued at \u20ac8,110 million (\u20ac9,554 million at December 31, 2019 based on the price of \u00a5636 per share).\n\n## Impairment test of the investment in Nissan 12 - I -\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the stock market value of the investment was 44.5%  lower  than  the  value  of  Nissan  in  Renault's  statement  of financial position (53.7% at December 31, 2019).\n\nIn application of the approach presented in the note on accounting policies, an impairment test was carried out at December 31, 2019. An  after-tax  discount  rate  of  6.95%  and  a  growth  rate  to  infinity (including  the  effect  of  inflation)  of  2.25%  were  used  to  calculate value  in  use.  The  terminal  value  was  calculated  under  profitability assumptions  consistent  with  Nissan's  past  data  and  balanced medium-term prospects.\n\nThe test result did not lead to recognition of any impairment on the investment  in  Nissan  at  December 31,  2019  and  it  was  considered that  a  reasonably  possible  change  in  the  main  assumptions  used should not result in a recoverable value lower than the book value of the investment in Nissan.\n\nI",

The  test  result  did  not  lead  to  recognition  of  any impairment on the investment in Nissan at June 30, 2020, and it was considered  that  no  reasonably  possible  change  in  the  main assumptions  used  should  result  in  a  recoverable  value  lower  than the book value of the investment in Nissan.\n\nThe same  applies for the impairment test performed at December 31, 2020 applying an after-tax discount rate of 6.21% and a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.71%.\n\n## Operations between the Groupe Renault 12 - J and/uni00A0the Nissan group\n\n## Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) and Sales Financing J1\n\nRenault  and  Nissan  follow  joint  strategies  for  vehicle  and component  development,  purchasing,  production  and  distribution resources.  This  cooperation  is  reflected  in  synergies  that  reduce costs.\n\nThe  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  is  involved  in operations with Nissan on two levels:\n\n- industrial  production:  crossover  production  of  vehicles  and P components in the Alliance's manufacturing plants:\n- sales by the Groupe Renault to the Nissan group in 2020 totaled P approximately \u20ac1,785 million (\u20ac3,374 million in 2019), comprising around \u20ac1,017 million for vehicles (\u20ac2,272 million in 2019), \u20ac669 million for components (\u20ac985 million in 2019), and \u20ac99 million for services (\u20ac117 million in 2019). The decrease is mainly  driven  by  sales  of  vehicles  made  by  Renault  Samsung Motors for Nissan North America, and the Nissan Micra made in Flins, France,\n- purchases  by  Groupe  Renault  from  the  Nissan  group  in  2020 P totaled  approximately  \u20ac1,361 million  (\u20ac1,896 million  in  2019), comprising around \u20ac1,000 million for vehicles (\u20ac1,046 million in 2019), \u20ac277 million for components (\u20ac655 million in 2019), and \u20ac84 million for services (\u20ac195 million in 2019),\n- the balance of Groupe Renault receivables on the Nissan group P is \u20ac463 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac521 million at December 31,  2019)  and  the  balance  of  Groupe  Renault liabilities  to  the  Nissan  group  is  \u20ac664 million  at  December 31, 2020 (\u20ac738 million at December 31, 2019);\n\nI\n\n- finance: in addition to its activity for Renault, Renault Finance acts P as  the  Nissan  group's  counterparty  in  financial  instruments trading to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Renault Finance undertook approximately \u20ac9.9 billion of forex transactions on the foreign exchange market for Nissan in 2020 (\u20ac17 billion in 2019).  Operations  undertaken  with  Nissan  on  foreign  exchange and  interest  rate  derivatives  are  recorded  at  market  price  and included  in  the  positions  managed  by  Renault  Finance.  In  the balance sheet, the derivative assets on the Nissan group amount to \u20ac36 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac26 million at December 31, 2019) and  derivative liabilities amount  to  \u20ac35 million  at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac4 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nRenault's  Sales  Financing  segment  helps  to  attract  customers  and build loyalty to Nissan brands through a range of financing products and services incorporated into the sales policy, principally in Europe. In 2020, RCI Banque recorded \u20ac106 million in service revenues in the form of commission and interest received from Nissan (\u20ac148 million in 2019). The balance of sales financing receivables from the Nissan group is \u20ac68 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac86 million at December 31, 2019) and the balance of liabilities is \u20ac156 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac184 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  signed  a  term  sheet  with  Nissan Europe to set out the principles for cooperation until March 31, 2025.\n\nThe  Alliance  partners  hold  investments  in  associates  and  joint ventures  that  manage  their  cooperation.  Details  of  these  entities' activity and location, and the Groupe Renault's influence over them, are given in note 13.\n\n## AVTOVAZ J2\n\nIn  2020,  total  sales  by  AVTOVAZ  to  Nissan  and  purchases  by AVTOVAZ from Nissan amounted to an  estimated  \u20ac56 million  and \u20ac15 million respectively (\u20ac118 million and \u20ac23 million in 2019).\n\nIn  the  AVTOVAZ  financial  position  at  December 31,  2020,  the balances  of  transactions  between  AVTOVAZ  and  the  Nissan  group consist mainly of:\n\n- a non-current receivable for jointly controlled assets amounting to P \u20ac0 (\u20ac25 million at December 31, 2019);\n- operating  payables  amounting  to  \u20ac14 million  (\u20ac18 million  at P December 31, 2019).",

Both types of operation are conducted through special purpose vehicles. Some public operations were subscribed by RCI  Banque,  which  makes  it  possible  to  have  securities  eligible  as collateral for the European Central Bank.\n\nIn  2020,  RCI  Banque  Group  undertook  two  public  securitization operations  in  France,  associated  with  the  rents  from  leases  with purchase options. One was a public operation backed by lease rent receivables, totalling \u20ac950 million of Class A instruments rated AAA by  DBRS  and  Aaa  by  Moody's  (of  which  \u20ac200 million  were self-subscribed  by  RCI)  and  \u20ac41.5 million  of  Class  B  instruments rated AA(Low) by DBRS and Aa3 par Moody's. The other was for an original amount of \u20ac474 million of Class A instruments rated AAA by DBRS and Aaa by Moody's, entirely self-subscribed by RCI.\n\nThe receivables assigned through such operations are not derecognized, as all risks are retained by the Group. The associated liabilities  correspond  to  securities  resulting  from  the  securitization operations,  and  are  recognized  in  other  debts  represented  by  a certificate.\n\nThe difference between the receivables assigned and the amount of the associated liabilities corresponds to the higher credit necessary for  these  operations,  and  the  share  of  securities  retained  by  RCI Banque to form a liquidity reserve.\n\nSecuritized assets can no longer be assigned or pledged. Subscribers to debt securities only have claims on the assets assigned.\n\n## Assets pledged as guarantees for management of the B2 liquidity reserve\n\nFor  management  of  its  liquidity  reserve,  the  Sales  Financing segment  has  provided  guarantees  to  the  Banque  de  France  under France's central collateral management system 3G (G estion Globale des  Garanties ) in  the  form  of  assets  with  a  book  value  of \u20ac7,465 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac5,882 million at December 31,  2019).  These  guarantees  comprise  \u20ac6,675 million  in the  form  of  shares  in  securitization  vehicles,  \u20ac104 million  in  euro bonds and \u20ac686 million in sales financing receivables (\u20ac5,325 million of  shares  in  securitization  vehicles,  \u20ac151 million  in  euro  bonds  and \u20ac406 million  in  sales  financing  receivables  at  December 31,  2019). The  funding  provided  by  the  Banque  de  France  against  these guarantees  amounts  to  \u20ac2,250 million  at  December 31,  2020 (\u20ac2,700 million  at  December 31,  2019).  All  assets  provided  as guarantees to the Banque de France remain in the balance sheet.\n\n## Sales financing receivables by maturity 15 - C -\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                   | December 31,  2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| -1 year                                       | 20,727               | 23,174              |\n| 1 to 5 years                                  | 19,675               | 21,675              |\n| +5 years                                      | 418                  | 525                 |\n| TOTAL SALES FINANCING RECEIVABLES - NET VALUE | 40,820               | 45,374              |\n\nI",

In  accordance  with  the recommendation  of  ESMA,  the  Sales  Financing  segment  did  not always consider that payment date extensions granted systematically  to  a  large  population  of  outstanding  receivables should give rise to transfer of the receivables to the three stages of risk (healthy receivables, receivables showing higher credit risk since\n\ninitial  recognition,  and  receivables  in  default).  For  exposures  that received  extensions  during  the  lockdown  periods,  the  method consists  of  covering  non-overdue  outstanding  amounts  concerned by  current  or  previous  moratoriums  at  the  provision  rate  used  for customer credit with higher risk since initial recognition. The Sales Financing  segment  also  raised  the  provision  estimate  for  the forward-looking  scenario  concerning  the  customer  segments  most severely  affected  by  the  crisis.  The  Sales  Financing  segment  also raised  the  weighting  of  the  'adverse'  forward-looking  scenario, while continuing the higher weighting for the stability scenarios and reducing the weighting of the most optimistic scenarios.\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                               | Financing for final customers   | Dealer financing   | December 31,  2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| Gross value                                                                               | 34,022                          | 7,862              | 41,884               |\n| Healthy receivables                                                                       | 29,148                          | 7,514              | 36,662               |\n| Receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition                          | 4,170                           | 284                | 4,454                |\n| Receivables in default                                                                    | 704                             | 64                 | 768                  |\n| % of total receivables in default                                                         | 2.1%                            | 0.8%               | 1.8%                 |\n| Impairment                                                                                | (951)                           | (113)              | (1,064)              |\n| Impairment in respect of healthy receivables                                              | (226)                           | (63)               | (289)                |\n| Impairment in respect of receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition | (252)                           | (17)               | (269)                |\n| Impairment in respect of receivables in default                                           | (473)                           | (33)               | (506)                |\n| Total net value                                                                           | 33,071                          | 7,749              | 40,820               |\n\nFinancing for final\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                               | customers   | Dealer financing   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Gross value                                                                               | 35,321      | 10,901             | 46,222              |\n| Healthy receivables                                                                       | 31,690      | 10,527             | 42,217              |\n| Receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition                          | 3,034       | 298                | 3,332               |\n| Receivables in default                                                                    | 597         | 76                 | 673                 |\n| % of total receivables in default                                                         | 1.7%        | 0.7%               | 1.5%                |\n| Impairment                                                                                | (747)       | (101)              | (848)               |\n| Impairment in respect of healthy receivables                                              | (173)       | (57)               | (230)               |\n| Impairment in respect of receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition | (167)       | (10)               | (177)               |\n| Impairment in respect of receivables in default                                           | (407)       | (34)               | (441)               |\n| Total net value                                                                           | 34,574      | 10,800             | 45,374              |\n\n## Exposure of sales financing to credit risk 15 - E -\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for the Sales Financing activity is  represented by the net book value of sales financing receivables plus the amount  of  irrevocable  financing  commitments  for customers  reported  under  off-balance  sheet  commitments  given (note 28-A).

They  account  for  1.53%  of Renault's share capital at December 31, 2020 (1.54% at December 31, 2019).\n\nThe Nissan group holds approximately 15% of Renault through its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Nissan  Finance  Co. Ltd.  (no  voting  rights are attached to these shares).\n\n## Capital management 18 - B -\n\nIn  managing  its  capital,  the  Group's  objective  is  to  guarantee continuity  of  business  in  order  to  provide  returns  for  shareholders and  benefits  for  other  stakeholders,  and  to  maintain  optimum capital structure in order to optimize its cost. The Group may adjust dividend payments to shareholders, redeem some of the capital or issue new shares.\n\nThe  Group's  objectives  are  monitored  in  different  ways  in  the different operating segments.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  must  comply  with  regulatory  ratios specific to banking  operations.  The  minimum  solvency  ratio (shareholders' equity including subordinated loans to total weighted risks)  is  8%.  RCI  Banque's  Core  Tier 1  solvency  ratio  is  17.34%  at December 31, 2020 (15.27% at December 31, 2019).\n\nThe Group also partially hedges its investment in Nissan (notes 12-G and 25-B2).\n\n## Renault treasury shares 18 - C -\n\nIn accordance with decisions approved at General Shareholders' Meetings, the Board of Directors decided to allocate all Renault treasury shares to current stock option and performance share plans and other share-based payment agreements awarded to Group managers and executives.\n\n|                                           | December 31,  2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Total value of treasury plans (\u20ac million) | 284                  | 344                 |\n| Total number of treasury shares           | 4,538,199            | 4,548,736           |\n\n## Distributions 18 - D -\n\nAt the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 19, 2020, it was decided not to distribute dividends. In 2019, the dividends were \u20ac3.55 per share giving a total of \u20ac1,035 million.\n\n## Translation adjustment 18 - E -\n\nThe change in translation adjustment over the year is analyzed as follows:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                    | 2020    | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Change in translation adjustment on the value of the investment in Nissan      | (1,131) | 377    |\n| Impact, net of tax, of partial hedging of the investment in Nissan (note 12-G) | -       | (157)  |\n| Total change in translation adjustment related to Nissan                       | (1,131) | 220    |\n| Changes related to hyperinflationary economies                                 | (21)    | (40)   |\n| Other changes in translation adjustment                                        | (749)   | 124    |\n| TOTAL CHANGE IN TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT                                         | (1,901) | 304    |\n\nChanges related to hyperinflationary economies consist of changes in the translation adjustment attributable to the Argentinian subsidiaries since January 1, 2018. In 2020, the effects of the partial hedge of the net investment in Nissan offset each other, and other changes in the translation adjustment mostly result from movements in the Russian rouble and the Brazilian real.\n\nI",

Until  2012,  it  also  periodically  granted  stock options,  each  with  their  own  vesting  and  required  holding  periods. All  plans  include  performance  conditions  which  determine  the number of options or performance shares granted to beneficiaries. Loss of the benefit of stock options or performance shares follows the applicable regulations: all options and rights are forfeited in the\n\nevent of resignation or termination and a decision is made for each individual  case  when  an  employee  leaves  at  the  Company's instigation.\n\nPerformance  share  plan  27  was  introduced  in  2020,  concerning 1,444 thousand  shares  with  initial  total  value  of  \u20ac13 million.  The vesting period for rights to shares is three years, with no minimum holding period.\n\nI",

A  liability  corresponding  to  these  put  options  is included  in  other  liabilities,  amounting  to  \u20ac100 million  for  the Brazilian  subsidiary,  \u20ac4 million  for  the  Argentinian  subsidiary,  and \u20ac61 million  for  the  Colombian  subsidiary  at  December 31,  2020 (\u20ac144 million, \u20ac7 million and 0 respectively at December 31, 2019). A corresponding charge is  made to  shareholders'  equity,  allocated  in priority  to  the  non-controlling  interests'  share  with  any  residual amount allocated  to  the  parent  company  shareholders'  share.  The liability is stated at fair value. Fair value is determined by estimating the potential purchase price, taking into account future results of the financing portfolio as it exists at the closing date and the provisions of  the  partnership  contracts.  This  is  a  level 3  fair  value,  as  it  uses recognized  models  but  their  significant  data  are  not  based  on observable market data.\n\nNew  partnership  agreements  were  signed  in  2018  with  Oyak  in Turkey,  including  perfectly  symmetrical  put  and  call  options  for non-controlling  investments,  entitling  Renault,  subject  to  certain conditions, to purchase Oyak's shares in Oyak Renault (call) and to sell  its  shares  in  Mais  (put),  and  entitling  Oyak  to  sell  its  shares  in Oyak Renault (put) and purchase Renault's shares in Mais (call). The exercise price for the put option, if exercised, will be determined by three independent experts who would be appointed at the exercise date.\n\nAnalysis of the contracts did not identify any circumstances beyond the  control  of  Renault SA  that  could  lead  to  Oyak's  put  option exercised without Renault SA being able to object. Consequently, no liability is recognized at December 31, 2020 in connection with these options.\n\nThere  are  no  significant  restrictions  on  the  Group's  capacity  to access  or  use  its  assets  and  settle  its  liabilities,  other  than restrictions that result from the regulatory framework in which the subsidiaries  operate.  The  local  supervisory  authorities  may  require banking subsidiaries to keep a certain level of capital and liquidities, limit  their  exposure  to  other  group  parties,  and  comply  with  other ratios.",

These  benefits  are  covered either by defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nThe  Group  makes  earnings-related  payments,  in  accordance  with local  custom,  to  the  national  organizations  responsible  for  paying pensions and similar financial benefits. There is no actuarial liability concerning these pension arrangements.\n\nThe total expense for defined-contribution plans was \u20ac415 million in 2020 (\u20ac603 million in 2019).\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nThe  accounting  treatment  of  defined-benefit  plans  is  described  in note 2-S,  and  involves  establishment  of  provisions.  These  plans concern:\n\n- indemnities payable upon retirement or departure, in application P of  legislation  or  agreements  in  certain  countries  such  as  France and Turkey;\n- supplementary  pensions  providing  employees  with  contractual P income; the countries applying this type of plan are in Europe ( e.g. the  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  and Switzerland);\n- other long-term benefits, chiefly long-service awards and flexible P holiday entitlements.\n\nDefined-benefit supplementary pension plans are generally covered by  contracts  with  pension  funds  or  insurance  companies.  In  such cases,  the  obligations  and  assets  are  valued  separately.  The difference  between  the  obligation  and  the  fair  value  of  the  assets held  to  fund  it  may  indicate  underfunding  or  overfunding.  In  the event  of  underfunding,  a  provision  is  booked.  In  the  event  of overfunding, an asset is recognized subject to certain conditions.\n\n## Principal defined-benefit plans of the Group\n\nIn France, the Group's retirement indemnities result from agreements  negotiated  with  each  French  entity  and  employee representatives. They are based on employees' salaries and length of service; payment  is  conditional  on  being  in  the  Company's employment  at  the  time  of  retirement.  Retirement  benefit\n\nobligations  for  France  are  entirely  covered  by  provisions,  and account for most of the Group's liabilities for retirement indemnities.\n\nThe Group's most significant supplementary pension plan is in the United  Kingdom,  where  two  defined-benefit  pension  plans  are managed  as  part  of  a  dedicated  pension  fund  comprising  two compartments:  one  concerns  Automotive  subsidiaries  (excluding AVTOVAZ)  and  the  other  RCI  Financial  Services Ltd.,  together covering  1,716 people.  This  plan  has  been  closed  to  new  members since  2004,  and  no  further  rights  have  been  earned  under  it  since December 31, 2019. All employees benefit from a defined-contribution pension plan from January 1, 2020. Underfunding at December 31, 2020 is valued at \u00a365 million for the fund compartment  dedicated  to  the  Automotive  (excluding AVTOVAZ)  segment  and  \u00a314 million  for  the  fund  compartment dedicated to RCI Financial Services Ltd.\n\nThis  pension  fund  (a  trust)  is  a  legal  entity  in  its  own  right.  It  is administered by a Board of Trustees with equal representation for the participating companies  and  their current and former employees. The fund is governed by local regulations, which set the minimum  funding  requirements  that  can  lead  to  additional contributions being made by the Group. After the last three-yearly valuation  in  2018,  the  Group  made  a  commitment  to  cover  the funding shortfall by 2027 through payments amounting to \u00a35 million maximum per year. The asset investment policy is defined for each section  of  the  fund  by  a  supervisory  body  which  examines  the performance  of  investments  quarterly.  The  risks  associated  with these plans are the usual risks (lower future returns on fund assets, a decline in the equities markets,  longer  life  expectancy  for beneficiaries, a rise in inflation, etc .).\n\n## Main changes in the Group's defined-benefit plans\n\nAt  December 31,  2020,  an  amount  of  \u20ac108 million  was  reclassified from  retirement  indemnities  to  provisions  for  restructuring,  for employees  who  will  benefit  from  the  Collective  Contractual Separation plan.\n\nAt  December 31,  2019,  the  Group  terminated  the  defined-benefit top-up pension plan that was set up in France in 2004, entailing the loss of the corresponding rights for its beneficiaries (members of the Group's  Executive  Committee  who  had  been  with  the  Group  for  at least five years, including two years in the Executive Committee).\n\n## Main actuarial assumptions used to calculate provisions and other data for the most significant plans 19 - B -\n\n|                                                                                              | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Main actuarial assumptions and actual data for the Group's retirement  indemnities in France | Renault s.a.s        | Other                | Renault s.a.s       | Other               |\n| Retirement age                                                                               | 60 to 65             | 60 to 67             | 60 to 65            | 60 to 67            |\n| Discount rate*                                                                               | 0.31%                | 0.2% to 2%           | 0.79%               | 0.1% to 2%          |\n| Salary increase rate                                                                         | 2.2%                 | 1% to 3%             | 2.5%                | 1% to 3%            |\n| Duration of plan                                                                             | 13 years             | 6 to 20 years        | 13 years            | 6 to 20 years       |\n| Gross obligation                                                                             | \u20ac1,191 million       | \u20ac187 million         | \u20ac1,158 million      | \u20ac189 million        |\n\nI",

(1)\n- Short-term portion of provisions: \u20ac1,570 million; long-term portion of provisions: \u20ac1,356 million. (2)\n- Restructuring costs include a reclassification of \u20ac108 million from the provision for retirement indemnities concerning employees who will benefit from indemnities under (3) the Collective Contractual Separation plan.\n\nAll  known  litigation  in  which  Renault  or  Group  companies  are involved  is  examined  at  each  closing.  After  seeking  the  opinion  of legal  advisors,  any  provisions  deemed  necessary  are  set  aside  to cover  the  estimated  risk.  During  2020,  the  Group  recorded  no provisions in connection with significant new litigation. Information on contingent liabilities is provided in note 28-A2.\n\nIncreases to restructuring provisions essentially comprise the effect of workforce adjustment measures in the Europe Region (note 6-A). In France, restructuring provisions have been recorded for employee departures  expected  under  the  Collective  Contractual  Separation\n\nplan, at the relevant amount net of existing provisions for retirement indemnities.\n\nAt  December 31,  2020,  'Other  provisions'  include  \u20ac91 million  of provisions  established  in  application  of  environmental  regulations (\u20ac84 million  at  December 31,  2019).  These  include  provisions  to cover  expenses  relating  to  end-of-life  vehicles  and  used  batteries, and  environmental  compliance  costs  for  industrial  land  in  the Europe Region and for industrial sites in the Americas and Eurasia Regions.\n\nI\n\nAt the date of this report, the best estimate of contributions that will be payable to the funds in 2020 is approximately \u20ac11 million.\n\nThe  Group's  pension  fund  assets  do  not  include  Groupe  Renault's financial  instruments.  Real  estate  investments  do  not  include  real estate properties occupied by the Group.",

If  the  Daimler  shares  were  sold, the gain on sale would not be transferred to profit and loss. Their fair value  is  determined  by  reference  to  the  stock  market  price.  At December 31, 2020, the stock market price (\u20ac57.79 per share) was higher  than  the  acquisition  price  (\u20ac35.52  per  share)  and  the unrealized  gain  on  the  Daimler  shares  held  is  \u20ac366 million.  The increase  in  fair  value  over  the  year,  amounting  to  \u20ac138 million (compared  to  a  \u20ac57 million  increase  in  2019),  is  recorded  in  other components of comprehensive income for 2020.\n\n## Other investments in non-controlled entities 22 - C -\n\nAt December 31, 2020, other investments in non-controlled entities include an amount of \u20ac27 million (\u20ac43 million at December 31, 2019) paid  to  the  Fund  for  the  Future  of  the  Automotive  ( Fonds  Avenir Automobile ). Under  the  support  plan  for  automotive  industry suppliers  introduced  by  the  French  authorities  and  carmakers,  the Groupe  Renault  has  made  a  commitment  to  pay  a  total  of \u20ac200 million to this fund as contributions are called. The outstanding amount payable by Renault at December 31, 2020 is \u20ac49 million. The fair  value  of  these  investments  is  determined  by  reference  to  the most  recent  net  asset  value  reported  by  the  Fund's  management company,  after  adjustment  for  any  relevant  information  that becomes known afterwards.\n\n## Cash not available to the Group 22 - D -\n\nThe  Group  has  liquidities  in  countries  where  repatriation  of  funds can be complex for regulatory or political reasons. In most of these countries, such funds are used locally for industrial or sales financing purposes.\n\nSome  current  bank  accounts  held  by  the  Sales  Financing Securitization  Fund  are  used  to  increase  credit  on  securitized receivables,  and  consequently  act  as  guarantees  in  the  event  of default on payment of receivables (note 15-B1). These current bank accounts amount to \u20ac670 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac540 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## Changes in financial liabilities and sales 23 - C financing debts\n\n## Changes in redeemable shares of the Automotive segments\n\nThe  redeemable  shares  issued  in  October 1983  and  April 1984  by Renault SA  are  subordinated  perpetual  shares  listed  on  the  Paris Stock  exchange.  They  earn  a  minimum  annual  return  of  9% comprising  a  6.75%  fixed  portion  and  a  variable  portion  that depends  on  consolidated  revenues  and  is  calculated  based  on identical Group structure and methods.\n\nRedeemable  shares  are  stated  at  amortized  cost,  calculated  by discounting  the  forecast  interest  coupons  at  the  effective  interest rate of the borrowing. At December 31, 2020, the Group revised the future  interest  flows  on  redeemable  shares  based  on  the  most recent  sales  forecasts  released  on  January 14,  2020  in  the 'Renaulution'  strategic  plan.  The  value  of  the  redeemable  shares was therefore adjusted downwards by \u20ac41 million, with recognition of  corresponding  income  in  Other  financial  income  and  expenses (see  note 7).  The  interest  of  \u20ac20 million  for  2020  (\u20ac20 million  in 2019) is included in interest expenses.\n\nThese  shares  were  trading  at  \u20ac373.65  at  December 31,  2020  and (\u20ac557  at  December 31,  2019).  The  financial  liability  based  on  the stock market value of the redeemable shares at December 31, 2020 is \u20ac298 million (\u20ac444 million at December 31, 2019).\n\n## Changes in bonds and other debts of the Automotive segments\n\nUnder  its  EMTN  program,  Renault SA  issued  a  Eurobond  on November 25,  2020  with  a  nominal  value  of  \u20ac1 billion,  5.5-year maturity and a 2.375% coupon.\n\nIn 2020, Renault SA redeemed bonds for a total of \u20ac586 million.\n\nIn  2020,  the  AVTOVAZ  group  repaid  financial  liabilities  totaling \u20ac460 million  and  contracted  new  financial  liabilities  totaling \u20ac1,002 million.\n\n## State-guaranteed credit facility of the Automotive segments\n\nOn June 2, 2020, the Groupe Renault opened a credit line with a pool of  five  banks,  for  the  maximum  amount  of  \u20ac5 billion  covered  by  a French State guarantee for 90% of the amount borrowed. The main characteristics of this credit line were the following:\n\n- the maximum total credit was \u20ac5 billion, and it could be drawn in P whole or in part, on one or more times, until December 31, 2020;\n- the initial maturity for each drawing was 12 months, and Renault P had  the  option  to  extend  the  maturity  by  a  further  three  years, with repayment of one-third each year;\n- the interest rate on each drawing was indexed on the 12-month P Euribor  for  the  first  year,  then  the  6-month  Euribor  for  any extensions;\n- early repayment after extension is possible for a principal amount P of at least \u20ac500 million.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAt December 31, 2020, \u20ac4 billion had been drawn on this credit line in  three  tranches:  \u20ac2 billion  drawn  on  August 5,  2020,  \u20ac1 billion  on September 22,  2020  and  \u20ac1 billion  on  December 23,  2020.  The remaining \u20ac1 billion credit is no longer available.\n\nThe Group considers that this credit facility has been provided under normal market conditions, and consequently that no subsidy is to be recorded when a drawing is made on it. The borrowing is therefore recognized at its initial nominal value.\n\nFor  the  initial  recognition  of  the  first  two  drawings,  the  Group considered  itself  able  to  repay  these  drawings  without  using  the extension  option,  and  the  credit  drawn  was  included  in  current liabilities. Due to the second lockdown in France which began in late October 2020, and the possible consequences of the second wave of the  COVID-19  pandemic  for  the  Group's  liquidity,  the  prospect  of non-extension for these two drawings was revised at December 31, 2020, and this change in prospects was treated as a modification of the liability under IFRS 9 - paragraph B5.4.6. This led to an increase in the financial liability, with recognition of a corresponding financial expense  of  \u20ac69 million  (see  note 7  'Financial  income  (expenses)'). The third drawing was recognized from the outset on the basis that the extension option is likely to be exercised.\n\nIf  extended,  these  credit  drawings  will  be  repayable  in  one-third instalments in 2022, 2023 and 2024 on the anniversary dates of the initial drawings,  with  the  possibility  of  early  repayment  of outstanding  instalments  at  Groupe  Renault's  initiative  at  each repayment date.\n\nNo extension option has been exercised at December 31, 2020 and the three drawings are included in non-current financial liabilities.\n\n## Changes in Sales Financing debts\n\nIn 2020, RCI Banque group issued new bonds totaling \u20ac1,586 million with maturities between 2021 and 2027, and redeemed bonds for a total of \u20ac2,639 million.\n\nIt  also  made  three  drawings  during  2020  under  the  TLTRO  III program, for the total amount of \u20ac1,750 million, maturing in 2023. Borrowings  from  credit  institutions  decreased  as  term  loans matured.\n\nNew  savings  collected rose by \u20ac2,797 million during 2020 (\u20ac1,712 million of sight deposits and \u20ac1,085 million of term deposits) to \u20ac20,508 million (\u20ac14,715 million of sight deposits and \u20ac5,793 million  of  term  deposits),  and  are  classified  as  other interest-bearing borrowings. These savings are collected in Germany, Austria, Brazil, France and the United Kingdom.\n\n## Cash outflows on leases\n\nChanges  in  cash  relating  to  leases  totaled  \u20ac261 million  in  2020 (including  \u20ac170 million  of  repayments  of  lease  liabilities  and \u20ac91 million  of  cash  outflows  for  variable  rents  and  low-value  and very  short-term  leases  benefiting  from  exemptions,  determined  by reference to the amount of lease payments in profit and loss, which provides a good approximation (see note 5-C)).\n\nI\n\n04",

        "page_content": "## Management of financial risks 25 - B -\n\nThe Group is exposed to the following financial risks:\n\n- liquidity risk; P\n- market  risks  (foreign  exchange,  interest  rate,  equity  and P commodity risks);\n- bank  counterparty  risk  and  credit  risk  on  customer  and  dealer P financing.\n\nRisk management differs depending on the operating segment. The risks described below concern the Automotive segments, (considering  AVTOVAZ  separately  in  certain  cases),  and  the  Sales Financing  segment.  The  Mobility  Services  segment  does  not  have any  specific  financial  risks  since  it  is  financed  by  the  Automotive segments.\n\n## Liquidity risk B1\n\nThe  Group  must  have  sufficient  financial  resources  to  finance  its automotive  and  sales  financing  businesses,  and  the  investments necessary  for  their  growth.  To  ensure  this  is  the  case,  the Automotive and Sales Financing segments borrow on the capital and banking  markets  to  refinance  their  gross  debt  and  guarantee liquidity. This exposes them to liquidity risks if markets are closed for long  periods  or  credit  is  hard  to  access.  The  Automotive  and  Sales Financing  segments  are  also  credit-rated  by  several  agencies.  Any downgrading  of  external  credit  ratings  could  limit  and/or  increase the cost of their access to the capital markets.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISKS - AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENTS\n\nThe Automotive segment's  liquidity  risk  is  managed  by  the Financing  and  Treasury  department.  It  is  founded  on  an  internal model that defines the level of the liquidity reserve the Automotive segments must maintain to finance their operations and development. The liquidity reserve is closely monitored by a monthly review and reporting that is validated by the Chief Financial Officer. Monitoring  and  management  of  the  liquidity  reserve  level  were reinforced in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRenault SA handles most refinancing for the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment  through  long-term  resources  via  the  capital markets (bond issues and private placements), short-term financing such as NEU CP (Negotiable European Commercial Paper), or bank financing.  Renault SA  has  several  debt  programs  at  December 31, 2020:\n\n- an EMTN Bond program with a \u20ac7 billion ceiling. This program has P been registered with the AMF;\n- a  Shelf  Registration  bond  on  the  Japanese  market  with  a P JPY200 billion ceiling. This program has been registered with the Japanese stock market authorities (Kanto Local Finance Buro);\n- a  NEU  CP  program  with  a  \u20ac2.5 billion  ceiling.  This  program  has P been registered with the Bank of France.\n\nRenault SA  and  its  debt  programs  are  credit-rated  by  several agencies. In 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Renault SA's  rating  was  downgraded  by  S&P  on  April 9  to  BB+  with  a negative outlook and by Moody's on May 28 to Ba2 with a negative outlook.  The  Japanese  agencies  E&I  and  JCR  also  downgraded Renault SA's credit outlook from stable to negative on August 3 and October 5 respectively.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn  2020,  to  cover  its  liquidity  requirements  in  the  context  of  the COVID-19 pandemic, Renault SA arranged the following financing:\n\n- a \u20ac5 billion bank credit line guaranteed by the French government P (in  June 2020).  \u20ac4 billion  of  this  credit  had  been  drawn  at December 31, 2020 (see note 23-C);\n- a  new  Eurobond  issue  under  its  ETMN  program,  with  nominal P value of \u20ac1 billion, 5.5-year maturity and a coupon of 2.375% (in November 2020).\n\nRenault SA also has confirmed credit lines opened with banks worth \u20ac3,430 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac3,480 million at December 31, 2019). These credit lines mature in more than one year and  were  undrawn  at  December 31,  2020  (and  2019).  They  form  a liquidity reserve for the Automotive segments. The maturities of the Automotive segment's financial liabilities at December 31, 2020 are presented in note 23-D.\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  Renault  SA's  confirmed  credit arrangements,  bank  loans  and  market  financing  does  not  contain any clause that could affect the continued supply of credit as a result of  changes  in  either  Renault's  credit  rating  or  its  financial  ratios. Certain  types  of  financing,  particularly  market  financing,  contain standard  clauses  ( pari  passu ,  negative  pledge  and  cross-default clauses).\n\nAVTOVAZ also uses local bank credit for refinancing. Its credit lines total  \u20ac1,139 million  at  December 31,  2020,  of  which  \u20ac1,021 million mature in more than one year. AVTOVAZ decides to make drawings on the basis of cash forecasts. The maturities of AVTOVAZ financial liabilities  at  December 31,  2020  are  presented  in  note 23-D.  These financial liabilities contain  no  covenant  that  would  lead  to accelerated repayment if certain financial ratios are not respected. AVTOVAZ also uses reverse-factoring arrangements (see note 23-E).\n\nAt  December 31,  2020,  the Automotive segments  have  a  liquidity reserve of \u20ac16.4 billion, sufficient to cover their commitments over a 12-month horizon. This reserve consists of \u20ac12.95 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and \u20ac3.43 billion of unused confirmed credit lines.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISKS - SALES FINANCING SEGMENT\n\nThe Sales Financing segment is very attentive to diversification of its  sources  of  liquidity.  In  recent  years,  Renault  has  diversified  its sources  of  financing  widely,  moving  into  new  distribution  zones  in addition to its longstanding base of euro bond investors.\n\nRCI Banque's liquidity risk management follows the recommendations of the European Banking Authority. It uses several indicators  and  analyses  (static  liquidity,  liquidity  reserve,  several stress  scenarios),  which  are  updated  and  reported  to  RCI  Banque's Financial  Committee  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  stress  scenarios include  assumptions  concerning  deposit  leakage,  loss  of  access  to new  financing,  partial  unavailability  of  certain  elements  of  the liquidity reserve and forecasts for issuance of new credit.\n\n04",

This policy has been followed for several years and enables the segment to reach the maximum number of investors.\n\nThere was only a modest degree of market financing during 2020, and the Company was not seriously affected by the rise in the cost of financing.  This  situation  arose  because  bond  redemptions  were lower in 2020 than in previous years (refinancing of the TLTRO II was launched early in 2016), and due to a slowdown in automotive sales that reduced the volume of new credit.\n\nSavings  deposits  collected  from  private  customers  increased  by \u20ac2.8 billion  from  2019  to  \u20ac20.5 billion  or  43%  of  net  assets  at December 31, 2020.\n\nOn  the  secured  refinancing  segment,  the  revolving  periods  for private  securitizations  of  automotive  loans  in  the  United  Kingdom and leasing in Germany were extended for a further year. The French subsidiary undertook its first securitization of vehicle leases with a purchase option amounting to \u20ac991.5 million: \u20ac950 million of senior instruments  (of  which  \u20ac200 million  were  self-subscribed)  and \u20ac41.5 million of subordinated instruments.\n\nRCI issued a 7-year fixed-rate bond of \u20ac750 million in January.\n\nWith  these  resources,  as  well  as  available  securities  in  Europe  for \u20ac16.6 billion,  comprising  \u20ac4.5 billion  of  undrawn  confirmed  credit lines  with  banks,  \u20ac4.5 billion  of  collateral  eligible  for  the  European Central  Bank's  monetary  policy  operations,  \u20ac7.4 billion  of  highly liquid assets (HQLA), and \u20ac0.3 billion of financial assets, RCI Banque is able to maintain its customer financing for more than 12 months without access to external liquidities.\n\nThe  RCI  Banque  group's  issues  and  programs  are  credit-rated  by several agencies. Details of the ratings are provided in the \"Liquidity Risks\"  chapter  of  the  \"Risk  Factors\"  section  in  the  Universal registration document. In the current context, in the case of Moody's and  Standard  &  Poor's,  any  ratings  downgrade  for  Automotive liabilities would entail a ratings downgrade for RCI Banque liabilities.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk B2\n\nThe  Group  made  no  major  changes  to  its  foreign  exchange  risk management policy in 2020.\n\nThe Group's exposure to foreign exchange risk principally concerns the Automotive segments.\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS/uni00A0- AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENTS\n\nIn  the Automotive segments,  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  can affect the following six financial aggregates: operating income (loss), working capital, financial income (expenses), share in in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures, shareholders' equity and net cash position.\n\nRenault  SA's  Financing  and  Treasury  department  manages  the foreign  exchange  risk  for  the Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ) segment.\n\nThe  Finance  department  of AVTOVAZ manages  the  foreign exchange  risk  in  a  very  similar  way  to  the  Automotive  (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment. It identifies, measures and manages the foreign exchange  risk  by  analyzing  the  net  position  in  each  currency.  At December 31,  2020  the  great  majority  of  cash  surpluses  and  bank debt of AVTOVAZ is denominated in Russian roubles, and no foreign exchange hedging was conducted in 2020.\n\n## Operating income and working capital\n\nIt is the Automotive segment's policy not to hedge future operating cash flows in foreign currencies, although exceptions may be made. Foreign  exchange  hedges  on  operating  and  working  capital  items require formal authorization from the Finance department or Senior Management, and the results of these hedges are then reported to the  Senior  Management.  In  such  cases  foreign,  and  when  it  is possible,  exchange  operations  are  mainly  undertaken  by  the subsidiary Renault Finance for currencies that are negotiable on the international markets.\n\nThe principal exposure to foreign exchange risks lies in the operating income (loss). At December 31, 2020 based on the 2020 structure of operating  results  and  cash  flows,  a  1%  rise  in  the  euro  against  all other currencies would have an unfavorable impact of \u20ac24 million on the Automotive segment's annual operating income (loss) after any hedging.\n\nThe principal exposure in 2020 concerned the pound sterling, with sensitivity of approximately \u20ac9 million in the event of a 1% rise in the euro against the pound sterling. The 10 largest exposures in absolute value and their sensitivities are presented below in millions of euros:\n\nAnnual net operating flows\n\n| Currency         |     | (\u20ac million)   | Impact of a 1% rise in the euro   |\n|------------------|-----|---------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Pound sterling   | GBP | 954           | (9)                               |\n| Russian rouble   | RUB | 858           | (8)                               |\n| Polish zloty     | PLN | 675           | (7)                               |\n| Swiss franc      | CHF | 378           | (4)                               |\n| Argentinian peso | ARS | 340           | (3)                               |\n| Indian rupee     | INR | (244)         | 2                                 |\n| Japanese yen     | JPY | (330)         | 3                                 |\n| Korean won       | KRW | (336)         | 3                                 |\n| US dollar        | USD | (394)         | 4                                 |\n| Romanian leu     | RON | (688)         | 7                                 |\n\nI",

        "page_content": "In  2020,  to  limit  the  foreign  exchange  risk  exposure  of  its  net operating  income  and  working  capital,  the  Automotive  (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment set up foreign  exchange  hedges  of  the  pound sterling, Argentinian peso and Turkish lira.\n\n## Financial income (expenses)\n\nTo avoid any exchange-related distortion of net financial income, it is the Automotive segment's policy to minimize the foreign exchange risk affecting financing and investment items in foreign currencies.\n\nAll Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment's exposures to foreign exchange  risks  on  financial  income  and  expense  items  are aggregated and monitored by the central Cash Management team, with monthly reporting to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nFinancing flows in foreign currency originating from Renault entities are  hedged  in  the  same  currency.  If  a  subsidiary  needs  external financing  in  a  currency  other  than  the  local  currency,  the  parent company  monitors  the  operations  closely.  Cash  surpluses  in countries that are not part of the parent company's centralized cash management  are  generally  invested  in  local  currency,  under  the supervision  of  the  Group's  central  Cash  Management  department. The  subsidiary  Renault  Finance  can  undertake  foreign  exchange operations  on  its  own  behalf,  within  strictly  defined  risk  limits.  Its foreign  exchange  positions  are  monitored  and  valued  in  real  time. This activity is chiefly intended to maintain the Group's expertise on the  financial  markets.  It  generates  very  short  exposures  and  does not exceed some tens of millions of euros, so that it cannot have a significant impact on Renault's consolidated results.\n\n## Share in the net income of associates and joint ventures\n\nThe  share  in  the  net  income  of  associates  and  joint  ventures  is exposed to foreign exchange risks. On the basis of its contribution to 2020  net  income,  a  1%  rise  in  the  euro  against  the  Japanese  yen would  have  decreased  Nissan's  contribution  by  \u20ac49 million.  This impact corresponds only to the impact of the euro on the translation of  Nissan's  contribution  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  Groupe Renault; it does not reflect the inherent impact of euro fluctuations on Nissan's own accounts, given that Nissan does varying levels of business in the euro zone and Renault has no control over this.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  exposure  of  equity  investments  (in currencies  other  than  the  euro)  is  not  generally  hedged.  However, due to its size, the investment in Nissan is subject to a partial foreign exchange  hedge  amounting  to  \u00a518 billion  at  December 31,  2020 (note 12-G). To limit liquidity risks in yen, the Group has set itself the rule of not hedging this net investment above an amount equal to its best estimate of the next three years' dividends in yen to be received from Nissan.\n\n## Net cash position\n\nFor the purposes of the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan, some of Renault's net financial indebtedness is denominated in yen. At December 31, 2020 a 1% rise in the euro against the yen would increase  the  net  cash  position  of  the  Automotive  segments  by \u20ac1.4 million. This net cash position may also be impacted by changes in  exchange  rates  concerning  subsidiaries'  financial  assets  and liabilities in their local currency.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Analysis of financial instrument sensitivity to foreign exchange risks\n\nThis  analysis  concerns  the  sensitivity  to  foreign  exchange  risks  of monetary assets and liabilities (including intra-Group balances) and derivatives denominated in a currency other than the currency of the entity  that  holds  them.  However,  it  does  not  cover  items  (hedged assets or liabilities and derivatives) concerned by fair value hedging, for which changes in fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument offset each other in the income statement.\n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity (before tax) of a 1% rise in the euro  against  other  currencies  is  assessed  by  converting  financial assets, cash flow hedges and the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan.  For  the Automotive segment,  this  impact  would  be  a favorable \u20ac6 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac10 million at December 31, 2019), explained by the yen bond issues that make up the  partial  hedge  of  the  investment  in  Nissan  (see  note 12-G)  and the partial hedge set up for future cash flows in pounds sterling in 2020.\n\nThe  impact  on  net  income  of  a  1%  rise  in  the  euro  against  other currencies  would  be  an  unfavourable  impact  of  \u20ac14 million  at December 31,  2020  (\u20ac7 million  at  December 31,  2019  excluding AVTOVAZ),  mainly  attributable  to  unhedged  operating  assets  and liabilities  denominated  in  a  currency  that  is  not  the  functional currency of the entity that holds them.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk/uni00A0- Sales Financing segment\n\nThe Sales Financing segment has low exposure to foreign exchange risks due to the management principles applied. No position can be taken under the central management framework for refinancing; the trading  room  hedges  all  flows  concerned.  Residual  and  temporal positions in foreign currencies related to the time differences in cash flows inherent to multi-currency cash management may still remain. They are monitored daily and the same hedging policy applies. The sales financing subsidiaries are obliged to obtain refinancing in their own  currency  and  as  a  result  are  not  exposed.  In  exceptional circumstances,  limits  are  assigned  to  subsidiaries  where  sales financing  activities  or  refinancing  take  place  in  several  different currencies,  and  to  subsidiaries  authorized  to  invest  some  of  their cash surpluses in a currency other than their local currency.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 the RCI Banque group's consolidated foreign exchange position reached \u20ac5.8 million.\n\nThe United Kingdom's departure from the European Union did not lead to the recognition of any provisions by the RCI Banque group at December 31, 2020. In  preparation  for  the  consequences  of  Brexit, all  the  activities  of  RCI  bank  UK  branch  were  transferred  on March 14, 2019 to a new entity, RCI Bank UK PLC, a credit institution that is a fully-owned subsidiary of RCI Holding. No further operation was necessary in 2020.\n\n## Interest rate risks B3\n\nThe  Group  made  no  major  changes  to  its  interest  rate  risk management policy in 2020. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk principally concerns the Sales Financing segment.\n\nI\n\n04",

Fixed-rate borrowings remain at fixed rates as long as the rate curve is close to zero, or even negative;\n- AVTOVAZ  cash  surpluses  and  bank  debts  principally  bear P floating-rate  interest.  In  2020,  AVTOVAZ  did  not  set  up  any hedging  instruments  for  its  financial  liabilities.  The  Finance department of AVTOVAZ  closely monitors interest rate movements in Russia, and if rates rise it will take steps to reduce the  impact  on  the  net  financial  income,  by  increasing  the proportion of fixed-rate debt as it refinances its portfolio.\n\nThe  ratio  of  liquidity  reserve  hedging  by  floating-rate  debts  is monitored  monthly.  Interest  rate  hedging  instruments  for  the Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  are  standard  interest swaps that are adequately covered by hedged liabilities, such that no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nThe financing in yen undertaken as part of the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan equity is fixed-rate.\n\nFinally, Renault Finance carries out interest rate transactions on its own  behalf,  within  strictly  defined  risk  limits,  and  positions  are monitored  and  valued  in  real  time.  The  risk  associated  with  this arbitrage activity is very limited, and has no significant impact on the Group's consolidated net income.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK - SALES FINANCING SEGMENT\n\nThe  overall  interest  rate  risk  represents  the  impact  of  fluctuating rates  on  the  future  gross  financial  margin.  RCI  Banque's  operating results  may  be  affected  by  movements  in  market  interest  rates  or interest rates applicable to customer deposits. The Sales Financing segment's  aim  is  to  limit  these  risks  as  far  as  possible  in  order  to protect its margin on sales.\n\nTo take account of the difficulty of precisely matching the structure of  borrowings  with  the  structure  of  loans,  a  limited  amount  of flexibility  is  allowed  in  each  subsidiary's  interest  rate  hedging. This flexibility is reflected in a sensitivity limit assigned to each subsidiary and validated by the Finance Committee, in an individual adaptation of part of the limit Renault assigns to the Sales Financing segment.\n\nA daily sensitivity calculation by currency, management entity, and asset  portfolio  is  used  to  ensure  that  each  entity  respects  its assigned limits. All RCI Banque entities use the same method for this assessment of interest rate sensitivity, which measures the impact of a 100 base point increase in interest rates on the value of balance sheet  items  for  each  entity.  Sensitivity  is  calculated  daily  for  each\n\nI\n\ncurrency  and  each  management  entity  (central  refinancing  office, French and foreign sales financing subsidiaries)  for  the  purpose  of overall  management  of  interest  rate  risks  across  the  consolidated scope of the Sales Financing segment.\n\nEach entity's  position  with  regard  to  its  limit  is  checked  daily,  and immediate  hedging  directives  are  issued  to  the  subsidiaries  if circumstances  require.  The  results  of  the  checks  are  reported monthly to the Sales Financing segment's Finance Committee, which checks that the positions comply with the Group's financial strategy and current procedural instructions.\n\nAnalysis  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment's  structural  interest  rate risk shows the following:\n\n- virtually all loans to customers by sales financing subsidiaries bear P interest at a fixed rate and have terms from one to seventy-two months. These loans are hedged by fixed-rate resources with the same  structure.  They  are  covered  by  macro-hedging  and  only generate  a  residual  interest  rate  risk.  In  subsidiaries  where  the financing bears interest at a floating rate, the interest rate risk is hedged by macro-hedging using interest rate swaps;\n- the  main  activity  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment's  central P refinancing office is refinancing the segment's sales subsidiaries. The  outstanding  credit  issued  by  sales  financing  subsidiaries  is backed by fixed-interest resources, some of which are micro-hedged by interest rate swaps, and floating-rate resources. Macro-hedging  transactions  in  the  form  of  interest  rate  swaps keep the sensitivity of the refinancing holding company below the limit  set  by  the  Group  (\u20ac32 million).  These  macro-hedging transactions  concern  floating-rate  resources  and/or  fixed-rate resources converted to floating-rate resources by micro-hedging of swaps.\n\n## ANALYSIS OF GROUP FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS' SENSITIVITY TO INTEREST RATE RISKS\n\nThe Automotive and Sales Financing segments are exposed to the following interest rate risks:\n\n- variations in the interest flows on  floating-rate financial P instruments  stated  at  amortized  cost  (including  fixed-rate instruments swapped to floating rate, and structured products);\n- variations  in  the  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  financial  instruments P stated at fair value;\n- variations in the fair value of derivatives. P\n\nImpacts are estimated by applying a 100 base point rise in interest rates over a one-year period to financial instruments reported in the closing statement of financial position.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment, the impact on shareholders' equity corresponds  to  the  change  in  fair  value  before  reclassification  in profit or loss (section 4.2.2) of fixed-rate debt instruments classified as  financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  components  of comprehensive income and cash flow hedges after a 100 base point rise in interest rates. All other impacts affect net income.\n\nCalculation  of  the  individual  segments'  sensitivity  to  interest  rates includes intersegment loans and borrowings.",

Shareholders' equity would be unaffected.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment ,  the overall sensitivity to interest rate  risks  in  2020  remained  below  the  limit  set  by  the  RCI  Banque group (\u20ac50 million at December 31, 2020).

The  Group  does  not use equity derivatives to hedge these risks.\n\nThe  Group  made  no  major  changes  to  its  equity  risk  management policy in 2020.\n\nThe  sensitivity  to  equity  risks  resulting  from  application  of  a  10% decrease  in  share  prices  to  the  financial  assets  concerned  at  the year-end  would  have  an  unfavorable  impact  of  \u20ac95 million  on shareholders' equity. The impact on net income is not significant at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Commodity risk B5\n\n## MANAGEMENT OF COMMODITY RISK\n\nCommodity  purchase  prices  can  change  suddenly  and  significantly and cannot necessarily be passed on through vehicle sale prices. This may  lead  Renault's  Purchases  department  to  hedge  part  of  its commodity  risks  using  financial  instruments.  These  hedges  are subject to volume, duration and price limits.\n\nIn 2020, Renault undertook hedging operations on base metals and precious metals, within the limits validated by the CEO of Renault SA for a temporary period.\n\nI\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- +\u20ac0.6 million for items denominated in Korean won; P\n- +\u20ac0.5 million for items denominated in Swiss francs; P\n- +\u20ac0.2 million for items denominated in Czech korunas; P\n- -\u20ac0.6 million for items denominated in Brazilian real; P\n- -\u20ac0.3 million for items denominated in pounds sterling; P\n- -\u20ac0.1 million for items denominated in Polish zloty.

Non-assigned  sales  receivables  and  receivables covered by guarantee are regularly monitored.\n\nAVTOVAZ trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. All future  customers  requiring  credit  facilities  are  subject  to  credit verification procedures.  In  addition,  receivables  balances  are monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis,  and  as  a  result,  the  AVTOVAZ Group's  exposure  to  bad  debts  is  not  significant.  The  maximum exposure  is  the  carrying  amount.  There  are  no  significant concentrations of credit risk within the AVTOVAZ Group.\n\n## CREDIT RISK ON CUSTOMERS, DEALERS AND COMMITMENTS GIVEN BY THE SALES FINANCING SEGMENT\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  is  exposed  to  customer  and  dealer credit  risk  when  risk  management  techniques  are  insufficient  for protection against default on payment by its counterparties.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of losses due to the incapacity of RCI Banque customers  to  fulfill  the  terms  of  a  contract  signed  with  the  bank. Credit risk is closely linked to macro-economic factors including the unemployment  rate,  corporate  bankruptcies,  debt  servicing  costs, revenue growth, disposable household income, dealership profitability and the price of used vehicles. It has a significant impact on the Sales Financing segment's business.\n\nThe level of credit risk on the dealership network is influenced by the dealers' financial health, the quality of guarantees, and the general demand for vehicles.\n\nRCI Banque uses advanced scoring systems and external databases to  evaluate  the  quality  of  loans  made  to  retail  and  business customers. It also uses an internal rating system to evaluate lending\n\nI\n\nto dealers.  Although  RCI  Banque  is  constantly  adjusting  its acceptance policy in response to market conditions, any increase in credit  risk  would  increase  its  cost  of  risk  and  its  provisions  for  bad debt. RCI Banque has detailed procedures to recover receivables that are compromised or in default, arranging repossessions and sales of unpaid  vehicles.  However,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  the policies  of  issuing  credit,  monitoring  credit  risk,  payment  recovery action, and repossession of vehicles are, or will be, sufficient to avoid an unfavorable impact on its financial results and position.\n\nAn  increase  in  credit  risk  would  increase  the  cost  of  risk  and provisions for bad debt, with a direct impact on RCI's financial results and potentially on its internal capital.\n\n## BANK COUNTERPARTY RISK\n\nDue to its operations on the financial and banking markets to invest cash  surpluses,  manage  foreign  exchange  risks  and  interest  risks, and  manage  payment  flows,  the  Group  is  exposed  to  a  bank counterparty risk.\n\nThis bank counterparty risk affecting Group entities is managed by both  the  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  segments  in  a  fully coordinated  approach.  It  is  founded  on  an  internal  rating  system based mainly on counterparties' long-term credit ratings and equity. This system is used by all Groupe Renault companies exposed to a bank counterparty risk.\n\nGroup  companies  which,  due  to  the  nature  of  their  business,  are significantly exposed to a bank counterparty risk are monitored daily to  ensure  that  they  comply  with  authorized  counterparty  limits,  in accordance  with  specific  procedures.  The  Group  produces  a consolidated  monthly  report  covering  all  its  bank  counterparties, organized by credit rating. This report provides a detailed analysis of compliance  with  limits  in  terms  of  amount,  maturity  and  type,  as well as a list of the main exposures.\n\nTo reduce the bank counterparty risk, most deposits are contracted with  large  network  banks  and  generally  have  terms  shorter  than 90 days,  as  this  allows  a  good  spread  of  the  risk  and  lowers  the systemic risk. In the event of volatile macroeconomic situations that may arise in emergent countries and potentially affect their banking systems,  the  Group  introduces  an  action  plan  to  step  up counterparty  risk  monitoring  and  makes  adjustments  to  the counterparty  limits  if  necessary.  The  exposure  on  each  banking group  is  assessed  monthly  on  a  consolidated  basis,  with  the Automotive and Sales Financing entities. The Group is not subject to any significant risk concentration for its operations on the financial and banking markets.\n\nNo losses  due  to  default  by  a  bank  counterparty  were  recorded  in 2020.",

These  transactions,  which  take  place  under  normal  market conditions,  represent  sales  of  \u20ac259 million  in  2020  (\u20ac257 million  in 2019),  an  automotive  receivable  of  \u20ac72 million,  a  sales  financing receivable of \u20ac282 million and  a  financing commitment  of\n\nI\n\n\u20ac40 million at December 31, 2020 (respectively \u20ac53 million, \u20ac403 million and \u20ac26 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nIn 2020, the Group benefited from a State-guaranteed credit facility, issued by a pool of banks as described in note 23-C.\n\n## Transactions with unconsolidated controlled 27 - D entities\n\nA  certain  number  of  controlled  entities  are  not  consolidated,  as explained in note 2-C, because their contribution to the consolidated financial statements is considered non-significant (note 17).\n\nThe  only  company  with  sales  of  more  than  \u20ac100 million  and/or  a balance  sheet  value  of  more  than  \u20ac100 million  is  Renault-Nissan Global Management, which manages Renault's expatriates.\n\nIn 2020,  the  Groupe  Renault's  expenses  with  this  company amounted to approximately \u20ac185 million (\u20ac255 million in 2019).\n\nIn the Group's financial position at December 31, 2020, the balances of  transactions  between  Renault-Nissan  Global  Management  and the  Groupe  Renault  consist  mainly  of  operating  receivables amounting to \u20ac116 million (\u20ac120 million at December 31, 2019) and operating  payables  amounting  to  \u20ac61 million  (\u20ac59 million  at December 31, 2019).",

        "page_content": "## NOTE/uni00A028\n\n## OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nIn the course of its business, Renault enters into a certain number of commitments,  and  is  involved  in litigations or subject to investigations by competition and automotive regulation authorities. Any  liabilities  resulting  from  these  situations  ( e.g. pensions  and other  employee  benefits,  litigation  costs, etc .) are  covered  by provisions. Details of other commitments that constitute off-balance\n\nsheet  commitments  and  contingent  liabilities  are  provided  below (note 28-A).\n\nRenault  also  receives  commitments  from  customers  (deposits, mortgages, etc .)  and  may  benefit  from  credit  lines  with  credit institutions (note 28-B).\n\n## Off-balance sheet commitments given and contingent liabilities 28 - A -\n\n## Ordinary operations A1\n\nThe Group is committed for the following amounts:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                            | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financing commitments in favour of customers  (1)                      | 2,437  | 2,583  |\n| Firm investment orders                                                 | 984    | 1,572  |\n| Assets pledged, provided as guarantees or mortgaged                    | 4      | 2      |\n| Sureties, endorsements and guarantees given and other commitments  (2) | 970    | 696    |\n\nAssets  pledged  as  guarantees  by  the  Sales  Financing  segment  for management of the liquidity reserve are presented in note 15-B.\n\n## Contingent liabilities A2\n\nGroup  companies  are  periodically  subject  to  tax  inspections  in  the countries  in  which  they  operate.  Accepted  tax  adjustments  are recorded  as  provisions  in  the  financial  statements.  Contested  tax adjustments  are  recognized  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  taking  into account the risk that the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful. Tax liabilities are recognized via provisions when there are uncertainties over the determination of taxes.\n\nRESA  (Renault  Espa\u00f1a SA)  was  notified  of  a  tax  reassessment  for transfer  prices,  amounting  to  \u20ac212 million  at  December 31,  2020, which  the  Groupe  Renault  is  contesting.  A  procedure  for  amicable settlement  between  France  and  Spain  will  be  started  in  2021.  No provision  has  been  recognized  in  connection  with  this  notification, since Renault considers that it has good chances of winning its case. A deposit of \u20ac135 million was paid to the Spanish tax authorities in December 2020,  recognized  in  non-current  financial  assets  and presented  in  cash  flows  from  investing  activities  (under  Decrease (Increase) in loans of the Automotive segments) in the consolidated cash flow statement. Another payment, of \u20ac77 million, is due to be made during the first quarter of 2021 and will be recognized in the same way.\n\nDisposals  of  subsidiaries  or  businesses  by  the  Group  generally include  representations  and  warranties  in  the  buyer's  favour.  At December 31, 2020, the Group had not identified any significant risk in connection with these operations.\n\nGroup  companies  are  periodically  subject  to  investigations  by  the authorities  in  the  countries  in  which  they  operate.  When  the resulting  financial  consequences  are  accepted,  they  are  recognized in the financial statements via provisions. When they are contested, they are recognized on a case-by-case basis, based on estimates that take  into  account  the  risk  that  the  proceedings  or  appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful.\n\nThe  main  investigations  by  the  competition  and  automotive regulations  authorities  in  progress  at  December 31,  2020  concern illegal agreements and the level of vehicle emissions in Europe.\n\nOn  January 9,  2019  the  Italian  Competition  Authority  (Autorit\u00e0 Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato - AGCM) fined RCI Banque \u20ac125 million, with Renault SA jointly liable for payment of the fine. The Group is contesting the grounds for this fine and has appealed against  the  decision.  Renault  considers  that  the  probability  of  the decision being cancelled or fundamentally amended by a court order is high. Due to the large number of variables affecting the amount of the fine,  if  upheld,  it  is  impossible  to  reliably  estimate  the  amount that could be payable at the end of the proceedings. On April 3, 2019 Renault's application for suspension of the payment was accepted, with  arrangement  of  a  bank  guarantee.  On  October 21,  2020  the court  cancelled  the  AGCM's  decision  in  its  entirety,  and  the  AGCM filed  an  appeal  against  that  ruling  on  December 23,  2020.  No provision  was  recognized  in  connection  with  this  matter  at December 31, 2020.\n\nIn the ongoing 'emissions' affair in France, Renault is aware that a formal  legal  investigation  was  opened  on  January 12,  2017  at  the request  of  the  Paris  public  prosecution  office.  This  stage  in  the procedure  was  seen  as  an  indication  that  the  French  prosecution office wished to pursue this matter. No provision was recognized at December 31, 2020 nor December 31, 2019.\n\nIn  the  proceedings  concerning  the  request  for  a  preliminary  ruling regarding  another  carmaker,  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European Union  (CJEU)  issued  its  interpretative  judgment  on  December 17, 2020.  This  ruling  is  binding  for  national  laws.  The  potential consequences of the next steps in these ongoing proceedings cannot be reliably estimated at this stage, and no provision was recognized in connection with this matter at December 31, 2020.\n\nI",

Renault  confirmed  in  a  press  release  of January 4,  2021  that  it  had  achieved  its  2020  CAFE  (Corporate Average  Fuel  Economy)  targets  for  passenger  vehicles  and  light commercial  vehicles,  subject  to  validation  by  the  European Commission in the coming months.\n\nApproximately 70% of the Group's sales are subject to this type of regulation. Achievement of the European CAFE target of 95g CO2/km in 2020 was confirmed for all new vehicles registered in 2020, even\n\nthough the average CO2 emissions of vehicles registered in the first half of the year was above the 95g threshold.\n\nGroup  companies  are  also  subject  to  the  applicable  regulations regarding  pollution,  notably  of  soil  and  ground  water.  These regulations vary depending on the country of location. Some of the associated  environmental  liabilities  are  potential  and  will  only  be recognized in the accounts if the activity is discontinued or the site closed. It is also sometimes difficult to determine the amount of the obligation reliably. Provisions are only established for liabilities that correspond to a legal or constructive obligation at the closing date, and can be estimated with reasonable reliability.\n\n## Off-balance sheet commitments received and contingent assets 28 - B -\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Sureties, endorsements and guarantees received | 2,949  | 2,671  |\n| Assets pledged or mortgaged  (1)               | 2,749  | 3,790  |\n| Buyback commitments  (2)                       | 5,452  | 4,832  |\n| Other commitments                              | 44     | 43     |\n\nOff-balance sheet commitments received concerning confirmed opened credit lines are presented in note 25-B1.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A029\n\n## FEES PAID TO STATUTORY AUDITORS AND THEIR NETWORK\n\nThe fees paid to the Group's statutory auditors and their networks are reported in section 7.3.1. of the 2020 Universal registration document.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A030\n\n## SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nFollowing  its  approval  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  January 14, 2021,  Luca  de  Meo,  CEO  of  the  Groupe  Renault,  presented 'Renaulution', a new strategic plan which aims to shift the Groupe Renault's  strategy  from  the  pursuit  of  volume  to  the  creation  of value, through three phases launched in parallel:\n\n- the 'Resurrection' phase, running until 2023, will focus on margin P recovery and cash generation;\n\nI\n\n- the 'Renovation\" phase, running until 2025, will bring renewal and P enrichment to the ranges, contributing to brand profitability;\n- the  'Revolution'  phase,  which  will  start  in  2025,  will  switch  the P Group's  business  model  to  technology,  energy  and  mobility, making  the  Groupe  Renault  a  frontrunner  in  the  value  chain  of new mobilities.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Annual Financial Statements\" section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the  French  Code  of  Ethics  (C ode  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors  for  the  period  from  January 1,  2020  to  the  date  of  our  report  and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of regulation (EU) no. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions.  Indeed,  this  crisis  and  the  exceptional  measures  taken  in  the  context  of  the  state  of  sanitary  emergency  have  had  numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel  restrictions  and  remote  working,  have  also  had  an  impact  on  the  companies'  internal  organization  and  the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## Valuation of equity investments\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAt December 31, 2020, equity investments are accounted for in Renault balance sheet for 14,296 million euros, representing one of the most significant  caption  of  the  total  assets.  Investments  are  valued  at  acquisition  cost  at  the  date  of  entry,  and  their  recoverable  value  is  then assessed by management as described in note 2.1 to the notes to the individual financial statements of Renault.\n\nWith respect to Renault's investments in fully controlled companies, Renault has opted for the equity method. The value of these investments is determined  based  on  their  contribution  to  the  consolidated  equity  of  Renault,  and  the  change  in  the  overall  share  of  shareholders'  equity corresponding to these interests is recorded in shareholders' equity under 'Equity valuation difference'.\n\nThe other investments mainly relate to Renault's equity investment in Nissan. This investment is valued at the lower amount between the book value and the value, which takes into account the share of net assets and profitability prospects of Nissan. The assessment of the recoverable value of Renault's investment in Nissan requires judgement from management.\n\nIn this context, we consider that the valuation of the investments was a key audit matter.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the value-in-use of equity investments, we mainly relied on the work performed for the purposes of the audit of Renault's consolidated financial statements. Our work mainly consisted in:\n\nRegarding Renault's investments in controlled companies:\n\n- check that the shareholders' equity in each of these investments corresponds to their contribution to the consolidated equity of Renault; P\n- check that Renault has performed the necessary adjustments, if any, to take into account potential impairment losses accounted for in the P group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nRegarding Renault's investment in Nissan:\n\n- assess the reasonableness of the main assumptions used by Renault in the impairment test performed to assess the recoverable value of its P investment in Nissan, by referring to Nissan's stock market value, mid-term plan and historical performance and the growth prospects of the Automotive sector.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe  have  also  performed,  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  specific  verifications  required  by  laws  and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Director's report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, L. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or awarded to the directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements,  or  with  the  underlying  information  used  to  prepare  these  financial  statements  and,  where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlled companies included in the scope of consolidation. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange  offer,  provided  pursuant  to  Article L. 22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  we  have  agreed  this  information  to  the  source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n04",

Therefore,  this  report  does  not  include  a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ).\n\n## Appointment of the statutory auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Renault by the Annual General Meeting held on April 30, 2014 for KPMG SA and on June 19, 2020 for MAZARS.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, KPMG SA was in the seventh year of total uninterrupted engagement and MAZARS in the first year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the financial statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  French  accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit,  Risks  and  Compliance  Committee is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of  internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the fnancial statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises  professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs P audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his or her opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the P circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by P management in the financial statements;\n\nI",

The Board of Directors also expressed a favorable opinion regarding her appointment as Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Renault SA from July 1, 2020.\n\nAs  part  of  Renault's  new  strategy  for  China,  which  has  two  main focuses,  light  commercial  vehicles  and  electric  vehicles,  Groupe Renault entered into an agreement  with  Dongfeng  Motor Corporation  for  the  transfer  of  Renault  SA's  shares  in  DRAC  to Dongfeng,  for  1 yuan.  DRAC  ended  its  Renault  brand-related activities as of April 1, 2020.\n\nThis  transfer  took  place  on  April 30,  2020  and  generated  a  loss  of \u20ac155 million.\n\nNissan's financial  year  ended  on  March 31,  2020  with  a  net  loss  of \u20ac5,589 million (-\u00a5671.2 billion) and Renault SA received no dividends from Nissan during the 2020 financial year.\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that appeared in the first quarter  of  2020  and  continued  throughout  the  financial  year,  the global automotive market suffered a downturn of 14.2% compared to  2019.  To  protect  its  employees,  and  in  compliance  with  the measures  introduced  by  national  governments,  Groupe  Renault suspended  its  commercial  and  production  activities  in  most countries during March. Furthermore, during the lockdown periods, almost  all  employees  not  working  in  production  and  sales  worked from  home,  and  furlough  measures  were  put  in  place.  Production and sales resumed  mainly  from  May 2020,  respecting the end-of-lockdown  measures  imposed  by  the  governments  of  the countries where Groupe Renault has operations. A second lockdown and  curfews  were  imposed  in  several  countries,  including  France, during  the  second  half  of  the  year,  and  these  also  had  negative effects on the Group's business activity.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of June 19, 2020, upon the proposal of the Board of Directors, decided not to distribute a dividend for 2019.\n\nOn  May 20,  2020,  Renault SA  signed  a  credit  agreement  for  a maximum amount of \u20ac5 billion covered by a French State guarantee.\n\nThe main characteristics of this credit line are the following:\n\n- the maximum total credit was \u20ac5 billion, which could be drawn in P whole  or  in  part  on  one  or  more  occasions,  until  December 31, 2020;\n- the initial  maturity  for  each  drawdown  was  12 months,  with  the P option  to  extend  the  maturity  by  a  further  three  years,  with repayment of one-third each year;\n- the  French  State  guarantee  covers  90%  of  the  total  amount P borrowed;\n- the interest rate on each drawdown is indexed on the 12-month P Euribor  for  the  first  year,  then  the  6-month  Euribor  for  any extensions;\n- early repayment after extension is possible during the term of the P credit, for a principal amount of at least \u20ac500 million;\n- it  concerns  a  pool  of  five  banks:  BNP  Paribas,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole, P HSBC France, Natixis and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nRenault SA has made three drawdowns totaling \u20ac4 billion: \u20ac2 billion drawn  on  August 5,  2020,  \u20ac1 billion  on  September 22,  2020  and \u20ac1 billion on December 23, 2020. The remaining \u20ac1 billion credit was no longer available at December 31, 2020.\n\nIn  November,  Renault  issued  a  new  bond  with  nominal  value  of \u20ac1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Renault SA had sufficient cash and sources of financing to ensure continuity of operations for the next 12 months, and had demonstrated its capacity to issue debt in the second half of the year.\n\n## Accounting policies 4.4.2.2\n\nRenault SA  has  drawn  up  its  annual  financial  statements  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  regulations  2014-03  of  the  ANC ( Autorit\u00e9 des Normes Comptables ), approved by ministerial decision of September 8, 2014 concerning the French chart of accounts.\n\nThe  following  methods  were  applied  in  valuing  balance  sheet  and income statement items:\n\n## Investments A.\n\nAs allowed by CNC ( Conseil National de la Comptabilit\u00e9 ) notice no.34 (July 1988),  as  an  alternative  to  the  standard  valuation  method  for investments  carried  in  the  balance  sheet,  Renault SA  has  opted  to state investments in wholly-controlled companies at equity:\n\nI\n\n04",

This amount cannot be distributed or  used  to  offset  losses.  When  it  is  negative,  a  provision  for general impairment is established as a charge against income.\n\nInvestments in companies not wholly controlled by Renault SA are valued  at  acquisition  cost,  less  related  expenses,  or  at  their  book value if this is lower. The book value takes account of the share of net assets and the profitability prospects. Provisions are established for the difference when the book value of the investments is lower than the gross value.\n\nLoans  granted  to  companies  and  receivables  relating  to  equity interests  are  recorded  at  historical  cost.  Impairment  is  recognized when there is a risk that these advances will not be recovered.\n\n## Marketable securities B.\n\nMarketable  securities  are  valued  at  acquisition  cost,  excluding related expenses and accrued interest for bonds, or at market value if this is lower.\n\nTreasury shares held for the purposes of free share and stock option plans  are  included  in  marketable  securities.  These  shares  are covered by a provision for expenses, corresponding to the difference between the value of the shares (acquisition price or net book value at the date of reallocation) and the exercise price of the options for beneficiaries, when that exercise price is lower than the acquisition cost.\n\nTreasury shares not allocated to a specific plan are also included in marketable  securities.  Impairment  is  recorded  if  the  stock  market price falls below the book value.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  securities  is  determined  mainly  by  reference  to market prices.\n\n## Receivables C.\n\nReceivables  are  stated  at  nominal  value.  Impairment  is  recognized when their realizable value falls below historical cost, notably based on age and the risk of non-recovery.\n\nI\n\n## Translation of foreign currency receivables and D. liabilities\n\nReceivables  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are translated as follows:\n\n- all receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies are converted at P the year-end exchange rate;\n- exchange differences arising between the date of transactions and P December 31 are recorded in prepayments and deferred income (translation adjustment);\n- a  provision  for  risk  equal  to  the  unrealized  exchange  losses  is P established after determining an overall foreign exchange position for each currency (including derivatives).\n\nUnrealized losses affecting the Nissan hedge are no longer covered by  provisions  in  the  income  statement.  Under  regulation  ANC 2015-05,  no  provisions  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement  for unrealized losses on the hedging instrument until the hedged cash flows are realized (date of liquidation or sale of the investment).\n\n## Redeemable shares E.\n\nRedeemable shares are recorded in a separate line of shareholders' equity at nominal value with no subsequent revaluation.\n\n## Loans and financial debts F.\n\nLoans  are  stated  at  their  nominal  amount.  Loan  costs,  including issuance  expenses,  and  bond  redemption  premiums,  which  are recorded in other assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the corresponding loan term.\n\n## Provisions for risks and liabilities G.\n\nProvisions for liabilities and charges are defined in accordance with ANC regulation 2014-03. They are established for probable payment obligations  existing  at  the  year-end.  A  contingent  liability,  in contrast, is an obligation that is neither probable nor definite at the date  the  financial  statements  are  established,  or  a  probable obligation  that  cannot  be  reliably  estimated.  Provisions  are  not established  for  contingent  liabilities,  but  an  off-balance  sheet commitment is reported, where relevant.\n\n## Derivatives H.\n\nChanges in the value of hedging derivatives are not recognized in the balance sheet unless partial or total recognition of such changes is relevant to ensure symmetrical treatment to the hedged item.\n\nThis  symmetrical  treatment  would  involve  revaluation  of  the hedging  instrument  in  a  transition  account,  with  a  corresponding entry  in  a  Cash  instrument  account,  in  parallel  to  the  translation adjustments booked on the hedged item.\n\nForeign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  loans  set  up  for  the  Nissan hedge  have  no  longer  been  included  in  profit  and  loss  since  the application  of  ANC  regulation  2015-05  from  January 1,  2017.  They are  recorded  in  specific  accounts  under  other  receivables  or  other liabilities  and  the  accumulated  amounts  will  be  transferred  to  the income  statement  at  the  date  of  liquidation  or  sale  of  the investment.",

P\n\n\u20ac6 million in accrued interest on the loan covered by a French State guarantee  are  included  in  the  net  accrued  interest  on  borrowing from credit institutions.\n\nOther  financial  expenses  consist  mainly  of  a  debt  waiver  with respect to the DRAC corresponding to the repayment by Renault SA of a loan taken out by the DRAC for \u20ac33 million.\n\n## Extraordinary items 4.4.2.6\n\nIn 2020, Renault SA's net extraordinary items correspond to a loss of \u20ac406 million,  mainly  resulting  from  derecognition  of  the  shares  in DRAC  (-\u20ac282 million),  offset  by  reversal  of  the  impairment  on  the shares  booked  in  financial  income,  and  the  balancing  payment  of \u20ac122 million  made  to  Dongfeng  in  connection  with  the  share transfer. The operation generated a loss of \u20ac155 million, which was recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2020.\n\nThere were no extraordinary operations in 2019.\n\n## Income tax 4.4.2.7\n\nAs Renault SA elected to determine French income taxes under the domestic tax consolidation regime when it was formed, this regime has applied to the Group in which Renault SA is taxed in France since January 1, 2004. French subsidiaries that are more than 95% owned by Renault SA pay their income taxes directly to the Company under this  regime.  Each entity included in the domestic tax consolidation records  its  theoretical  taxes  as  if  it  was  taxed  separately.  The  tax saving generated by this system is treated as income for Renault SA, the Company heading the group of entities concerned. The Renault tax  group,  applying  the  principle  of  neutrality,  Renault SA  is  not obliged to reallocate or reimburse the subsidiaries for the tax savings resulting from utilization of their tax losses.\n\nThe  maximum allowable  amount  of  losses  carried  forward  against taxable income is \u20ac1 million plus 50% of the taxable income above that amount. The balance can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThese rules are applicable:\n\n- for determining the income/loss of the tax consolidation group; P\n- by convention, for determining the income/loss of each company P included  in  the  tax  consolidation  serving  as  a  base  for  their calculation of income tax.\n\nThese rules on tax loss carryforwards apply to all losses existing at the year-end, whatever their origin.\n\nIn practice, Renault SA has not charged deficits for the determination  of  its  2020  taxable  income,  which  amounted  to -\u20ac2,597 million.\n\nIn  2020,  the  tax  consolation  group  waived  the  reduced  rate  on industrial royalties as permitted by Article 39 terdecies of the CGI.\n\nThe  income  generated  by  the  tax  consolidation  in  2020  was \u20ac103 million,  corresponding  to  the  income  tax  paid  by  the subsidiaries of Renault SA, including any tax adjustments, as if they were taxed separately.\n\nDetails of the tax charge related to the year are as follows:\n\nTaxes\n\nNet income\n\n| (\u20ac million)                           | Pre-tax income   | Theoretical   | Netting   | Credit generated   | Tax credit   | Net tax due   | Theoretical   | As booked   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Current income subject to normal rate | 167              | 55            | (55)      |                    |              |               | 112           | 167         |\n| Extraordinary items                   | (406)            | (87)          | 87        |                    |              |               | (319)         | (406)       |\n| Tax consolidation                     |                  | (103)         |           |                    |              | (103)         |               | 103         |\n| Allocations/provisions                |                  | 1             |           |                    |              | 1             |               | (1)         |\n| Other                                 |                  | 2             |           |                    |              | 2             |               | (2)         |\n| TOTAL                                 | (239)            | (132)         | 32        |                    |              | (100)         | (207)         | (140)       |\n\nDetails of Renault SA's deferred tax position are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                 | 2020       | 2020            | 2019       | 2019            | Change     | Change          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                     | Assets (1) | Liabilities (2) | Assets (1) | Liabilities (2) | Assets (1) | Liabilities (2) |\n| Expenses deducted (or taxed income) not yet recognized  for accounting purposes | 17         | 68              | 6          | 55              | 11         | 13              |\n| TOTAL                                                                           | 17         | 68              | 6          | 55              | 11         | 13              |\n\ni.e. future tax credit.

Until  2012,  it  also  periodically  granted  stock options,  with  prices  and  exercise  periods  specific  to  each  plan.  All plans include performance conditions which determine the number of  options  or  performance  shares  granted  to  beneficiaries.  Loss  of the  benefit  of  stock  options  or  performance  shares  follows  the applicable  regulations:  all  options  and  rights  are  forfeited  in  the\n\nevent of resignation or termination and a decision is made for each individual  case  when  an  employee  leaves  at  the  Company's instigation.\n\nNew performance share plans were introduced in 2020, concerning 1,440 thousand  shares.

Due in particular to the second lockdown measures  implemented  in  France  at  the  end  of  October 2020  and the  possible  consequences  of  the  second  wave  of  the  COVID-19\n\npandemic  on  the  Group's  liquidity,  the  prospect  of  not  extending these two drawdowns was revised at the end of 2020.\n\nIn the event of an extension, the drawdowns are repayable in thirds in 2022, 2023 and 2024 on the anniversary dates of the drawdowns, with  Renault  SA  having  the  option  of  early  repayment  of  the remaining maturities on each repayment date.\n\nAt  December 31,  even  though  no  extension  option  had  yet  been exercised by the Group, the three drawdowns are due on the balance sheet  in  1  to  2  years  for  \u20ac1,320 million,  in  2  to  3  years  for \u20ac1,320 million and in 3 to 4 years for \u20ac1,360 million.\n\n|                  | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (\u20ac million)      | Total               | <1 year             | 1 to 2 years        | 2 to 3 years        | 3 to 4 years        | 4 to 5 years        |\n| Nominal value    | 435                 | 95                  | 75                  | 25                  | 50                  | 190                 |\n| Accrued interest | 3                   | 3                   |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| TOTAL            | 438                 | 98                  | 75                  | 25                  | 50                  | 190                 |\n\n## BREAKDOWN BY CURRENCY\n\n|             | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (\u20ac million) | Before hedging       | After hedging        | Before hedging      | After hedging       |\n| Euro        | 4,403                | 4,403                | 438                 | 438                 |\n| TOTAL       | 4,403                | 4,403                | 438                 | 438                 |\n\n## BREAKDOWN BY INTEREST RATE TYPE\n\n|               | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (\u20ac million)   | Before hedging       | After hedging        | Before hedging      | After hedging       |\n| Fixed Rate    | 4,275                | 4,275                | 266                 | 361                 |\n| Floating Rate | 128                  | 128                  | 172                 | 77                  |\n| TOTAL         | 4,403                | 4,403                | 438                 | 438                 |\n\n## Other loans and financial debts C.\n\nOther  loans  and  financial  debts  amounted  to  \u20ac3,942 million  at December 31,  2020  (\u20ac3,214 million in 2019), and principally comprise:\n\n- \u20ac2,624 million in borrowings from Group subsidiaries with surplus P cash;\n\n## Other liabilities 4.4.2.16\n\nChanges in other liabilities were as follows:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                            | At start of year   | Change   |   At year-end |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Trade payables and related accounts                                    |                    | 3        |             3 |\n| Social liabilities                                                     |                    | 1        |             1 |\n| Tax liabilities                                                        | 681                | 8        |           689 |\n| Liabilities related to other assets                                    | 5                  |          |             5 |\n| Other liabilities                                                      | 6                  | (4)      |             2 |\n| TOTAL*                                                                 | 692                | 8        |           700 |\n| Current portion (less than one year) * Long-term portion (over 1 year) | 692                |          |           201 |\n|                                                                        |                    |          |           499 |\n\nThe variation in tax liabilities is mainly due to a \u20ac8 million increase in the tax consolidation.\n\nI\n\n- \u20ac1,318 million in treasury notes.

Renault SA  also  undertakes  forward exchange  operations  to  hedge  loans  and  borrowings  in  foreign currencies with its subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nRenault SA  carries  most  of  the  Group's  indebtedness.  Its  interest rate risk management policy applies two basic principles: long-term investments  use  fixed-rate  financing,  and  investments  for  liquidity reserves use floating-rate financing. The financing in yen undertaken as part of the hedge of Nissan equity is fixed-rate.\n\nRenault SA  uses  derivatives  to  implement  the  above  interest  rate and exchange rate risk management policies. These operations are undertaken with Renault Finance, a wholly-owned Groupe Renault subsidiary.\n\nRENAULT SA ANNUAL  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Deferred income 4.4.2.18\n\nDeferred  income  comprises  unrealized  foreign  exchange  gains  on borrowings issued in yen or swapped to yen, and a foreign exchange gain on repayment of borrowings issued in yen used for the Nissan hedge, which is recorded in a cash instrument valuation difference account, in the amount of \u20ac18 million.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe  Group's  Automotive  operating  segment  needs  sufficient financial  resources  to  finance  its  day-to-day  business  and  the investments  necessary  for  future  growth.  It  therefore  regularly borrows  on  the  banking  and  capital  markets  to  refinance  its  debt, and this exposes it to a liquidity risk in the event of market closure or tensions  over  credit  availability.  As  part  of  its  centralized  cash management  policy,  Renault SA  handles  most  refinancing  for  the Automotive  operating  segment  via  the  capital  markets  through long-term resources (bond issues, private placements) and short-term financing such as treasury notes, or by bank financing.\n\nRenault SA  also  has  confirmed  credit  agreements  with  banking establishments (see note 4.4.2.20).\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  these  financing  arrangements and  credit  agreements  contains  no  clause  that  might  adversely affect  credit  availability  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  Renault's  credit rating or financial ratio compliance.\n\nGiven the available cash reserves, confirmed credit lines unused at year-end,  and  the  prospects  for  renewal  of  short-term  financing, Renault SA has sufficient financial resources to cover its commitments over a 12-month horizon.\n\nI",

This  stage  in  the procedure  was  seen  as  an  indication  that  the  French  prosecution office wished to pursue this matter.

The  Group  is  contesting  the  grounds  for  this  fine  and  intends  to appeal against the decision. Renault considers that the probability of the decision being cancelled or fundamentally amended by a court is high. Due to the large number of variables affecting the amount of the fine,  if  upheld,  it  is  impossible  to  reliably  estimate  the  amount that could be payable at the end of the proceedings. On April 3, 2019 Renault's application for suspension of the payment was accepted, with  arrangement  of  a  bank  guarantee.  On  October 21,  2020  the court  cancelled  the  AGCM's  decision  in  its  entirety,  and  the  AGCM filed  an  appeal  against  that  ruling  on  December 21,  2020.

The  right  to  attend Annual  General  Meetings  is  evidenced  by  the  registration  of  the shares in an account in the name of the shareholder or in the name of  the  registered  intermediary  acting  on  his  or  her  behalf,  by midnight (zero hours) Paris time on the second working day before the Annual General Meeting, either in the registered share account held  by  the  Company  or  in  the  bearer  share  accounts  held  by  an authorized  intermediary.  The  registration  of  bearer  shares  in  the share records held by the authorized intermediary is evidenced by a shareholding certificate issued by the said intermediary.\n\n## Shares and voting rights 5.1.2.3\n\nShares are registered in an account according to the provisions and terms  established  by  law.  Fully  paid-up  shares  are  in  either registered or bearer form, at the discretion of their owner. However, shares that are not fully paid-up must be in registered form.\n\nEach  shareholder  has  as  many  votes  as  he  or  she  owns  shares, subject to the provisions below.\n\nSince  April  3,  2016,  pursuant  to  Article  L.  225-123  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  as  amended  by  Law  no.  2014-384  of  March  29, 2014 (the so-called Florange Law), unless provided otherwise in the Renault  articles  of  association  adopted  subsequently  to  the promulgation  of  the  Florange  Law,  a  voting  right  double  to  that conferred to other shares is automatically attributed to all fully paid up shares for which proof of registration is provided for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder.\n\nAt  December  31,  2020,  108,310,457  Renault  shares  held  double voting  rights,  representing  around  36.6%  of  the  share  capital  and around 69.7% of the voting rights that may be exercised in Renault's Annual General Meeting at that date.\n\nThe double voting right automatically ceases for any share that has been  converted  to  a  bearer  share  or  undergone  a  transfer  of ownership, subject to any exceptions provided for by law.\n\nFree  shares  resulting  from  the  capital  increase,  earnings  or  other paid-in capital are entitled to double voting rights from their date of issue  if  they  are  attributed  on  account  of  shares  already  enjoying such rights.\n\nIn addition, treasury shares do not carry voting rights.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the theoretical number of voting rights was 404,032,741.\n\nIn view of the 4,548,199 Treasury shares and the 44,358,343 shares held  by  Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd.  (see  chapter  5.2.6.1  below),  all  of which are deprived of voting rights, the total number of exercisable voting rights as at December 31, 2020 was 310,777,856.\n\n## Identifiable bearer shares 5.1.2.4\n\nThe  Company  is  authorized  to  make  use  of  the  appropriate  legal provisions  for  identifying  shareholders  having  immediate  or  future voting rights in its own Shareholders' Meetings.\n\n## Shareholding disclosures 5.1.2.5\n\nIn addition to the legal requirement for shareholders to inform the Company  if  they  hold  certain  percentages  of  its  share  capital  or voting rights, every shareholder or fund management company that comes into possession of a number of shares above 2% of the share capital or voting rights, or a multiple of this percentage representing less than or equal to 5% of the share capital or voting rights, shall inform  the  Company  of  the  total  number  of  shares  held.  Such disclosure  shall  be  made  by  registered  letter  with  return-receipt within  a  time  period  set  forth  in  a  Conseil  d'\u00c9tat  decree,  starting from  the  date  of  registration  of  the  shares  that  brought  the shareholder's  interest  up  to  or  beyond  the  threshold.  In  excess  of 5%,  the  aforementioned  disclosure  requirement  applies  to  1% fractions of the share capital or voting rights.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  determining  the  thresholds  described  above, indirectly  held  shares  or  equity  equivalents  held  as  defined  by  the provisions of Articles L. 233-7 and L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code will also be taken into account.\n\nThe declarer must certify that the said declaration includes all shares held or owned as per the provisions of the preceding paragraph, and must  indicate  the  acquisition  date(s).  The  disclosure  requirement applies in the same manner if the holding of shares falls below any of the aforementioned thresholds, 2% or 1% as applicable.\n\nIf the conditions described above are not complied with, any shares exceeding  the  fraction  that  should  have  been  declared  shall  be deprived of its voting rights at any Shareholders' Meetings held in a period of two years following the date of due notification, in so far as this  is  requested  at  the  meeting  by  one  or  more  shareholders who together hold at least 1% of share capital.\n\n## Threshold crossings in 2020\n\nIn  2020, the Company received declarations for the crossing of the legal threshold of 5% of the voting rights, alternately upwards and downwards,  from  BlackRock,  Inc.,  acting  on  behalf  of  clients  and funds under its management. BlackRock's most recent notification, dated  August  18,  2020,  indicated  that  it  held  4.54%  of  the Company's share capital and 3.32 of its voting rights.\n\nI\n\n05",

The  authorization  was  granted  until December 12, 2020. A new share buyback program was authorized by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  June  19,  2020,  rendering  the program  authorized  on  June  12,  2019  ineffective  from  the  date  of said meeting.\n\nIn  February  2020,  Renault  acquired  1,270,000  of  its  own  shares  as part of the share buyback program approved by the Annual General Meeting of June 12, 2019.\n\nThe  4,538,199  shares  held  directly  or  indirectly  by  Renault  as  at December 31, 2020, are allocated in their entirety to the fulfilment\n\nof  free  performance  share  plans  or  any  other  form  of  allocation, allotment or transfer granted to employees or senior executives of the Company.  The  shares  acquired  by  the  beneficiaries  of share-based  compensation  (Long-Term  Incentives)  must  not  have any  effect  on  the  share  capital  structure.  Shares  acquired  under  a free performance share award shall therefore come from the share buyback program. The aim is to leave the Company's share capital unchanged.\n\nPercentage of treasury shares held directly or indirectly as at December 31, 2020: 1.53%.\n\nNumber  of  shares  canceled  over  the  24  months  preceding December 31, 2020: 0.\n\nNumber  of  shares  held  in  the  portfolio  as  at  December  31, 2020: 4,538,199.\n\nNet carrying amount of the portfolio as at December 31, 2020: \u20ac262,256,710.\n\nPortfolio value as at December 31, 2020 (2) : \u20ac162,285,996.\n\n## TRADING BY RENAULT IN ITS OWN SHARES IN 2020 AS PART OF THE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY THE COMBINED GENERAL MEETING OF JUNE 12, 2019\n\n|                                             | Total gross flows at December 31, 2020   | Total gross flows at December 31, 2020   | Long and short positions at December 31, 2020   | Long and short positions at December 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             | Buy                                      | Sell                                     | Open buy positions                              | Open sell positions                             |\n| Number of shares                            | 1,270,000                                | 0                                        | Nil                                             | Nil                                             |\n| Average selling, purchase or exercise price | 32.24                                    | 0                                        | Nil                                             | Nil                                             |\n| AMOUNT                                      | 40,943,490                               | 0                                        | NIL                                             | NIL                                             |\n\n## Description of the share buyback program submitted for authorization to the Annual General Meeting of April 23, 2021\n\nPursuant to Articles 241-1 to 241-7 of the French Financial Market Authority  (AMF)  General  Regulation  and  Article  L.  451-3  of  the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code,  this  section  describes  the objectives  and  arrangements  for  the  new  treasury  share  buyback program organized by Renault, which will be submitted for approval to the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders of April 23, 2021.\n\nThe objectives of the program are to:\n\n- cancel all or some of the shares acquired, notably to compensate i. for dilution arising from the exercise of share subscription options or the acquisition of shares allocated free of charge, subject to the adoption  of  seventeenth  resolution  put  to  this  Annual  General Meeting;\n- use  all  or  some  of  the  shares  acquired  to  implement  any  share ii. purchase option plan or restricted share plan, or any other form of assignment, allocation, disposal, or transfer for former or current employees  and  managers  of  the  Company  and  its  Group,  and complete any hedging transaction relating to any such transactions, within the terms established by law;\n- This paragraph includes information that must be given in the description of the program in application of Article 241-2 of the AMF General (1) Regulation and information required in application of the provisions of Article L. 225-211 of the French Commercial Code.\n- Based on a stock market price of \u20ac35.76 at December 31, 2020.

As at December 31, 2020, this was distributed as follows:\n\n- the French State held 15.01% of the share capital corresponding to P 22.00% of theoretical voting rights and 28.61% of exercisable voting rights  in  Renault  (excluding  the  application  of  the  restrictions described in chapter 5.2.6.2 of the Universal registration document);\n- the  Nissan  group,  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  Nissan P Finance Co., Ltd., held 15% of Renault's share capital (unchanged compared to December 31, 2019). However, Nissan Finance Co., Ltd. is not entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to these shares  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  233-31  of  the French Commercial Code, owing to Renault's ownership interest in Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., parent company of Nissan Finance Co., Ltd.;\n- the Daimler group, through its subsidiaries Daimspain, Daimspain P DAG and Daimspain DT, holds 3.10% of the capital and 5.07% of the exercisable voting rights in Renault;\n- Renault's  employees  and  former  employees  own  3.48%  of  the P share  capital,  including  2.91%  via  FCPE  mutual  funds  under collective  management  and  0.57%  by  employee  beneficiaries  of free share allocations since the 2016 plan;\n- treasury  stock  represented  1.53%  of  the  share  capital.  Under P French law, such shares do not carry voting rights;\n- the free float represented 61.88% of the share capital (compared P with 62.44% as at December 31, 2019); and\n- the members of the Board of Directors together and directly hold P less than 0.5% of the Company's share capital.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no other shareholder holds more than 5% of the capital or voting rights, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert, other than the French State or Nissan Finance Co, Ltd.\n\nA survey of the holders of Renault bearer shares was conducted on November 30, 2020.\n\nThis gave an estimated breakdown of the public ownership's interest by category of major shareholder. At that date:\n\n- the  institutional  shareholders  owned  44.15%  of  Renault's  share P capital, it being stated that:\n- French institutional investors held 11.42% of the share capital, P\n- foreign institutional investors held 32.73% of the share capital, and P\n- the  10  largest  French  and  foreign  institutional  investors  held P approximately 18.62% of the share capital;\n- the remaining public ownership in the capital i.e., 17.73% was held P primarily by individual shareholders.\n\n## Shareholder agreements on shares 5.2.6.2 and voting rights of the Company\n\n## Absence of in concert action between Renault and Daimler\n\nRenault  and  Daimler  have  declared  that  they  are  not  acting  in concert, directly or indirectly, as defined in Article L. 233-10 of the French  Commercial  Code.  To  the  best  knowledge  of  the  Company,\n\nI\n\nand as at the date of this Universal registration document, there are no shareholder  agreement  governing  relations  between  the Company's shareholders, and no in concert actions.\n\n## Restrictions on the transfer of shares\n\nAs  part  of  the  long-term  strategic  Master  Cooperation  Agreement signed  on  April 7,  2010  by  Renault  SA,  Nissan  Motor  Co.,  Ltd., Renault-Nissan B.V. and Daimler AG, the Parties made the following commitments  in  accordance  with  Article L. 22-10-11  of  the  French Commercial Code:\n\n- right of first offer: if Daimler wishes to transfer its Renault shares P (either  at  the  end  of  the  lock-up  commitment  or  during  that period in case of authorized transfer), Renault benefits from the right of first offer, allowing it to acquire those shares. If Renault chooses  not  to  exercise  its  right,  Daimler  may  sell  its  shares  to third parties that are not competitors of Renault or propose them for sale on the market;\n- commitment in the event of a hostile public offer: after the end of P the lock-up commitment, Daimler agrees to not tender its shares to a public offer on Renault shares that has not received approval from Renault's Board of Directors. This commitment will end on termination of the Master Cooperation Agreement.\n\n## Restrictions on the free exercise of voting rights attached to shares held by the French State\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  discussions  conducted,  on  the  one  hand between Renault and Nissan and on the other between Renault and the French State, to restore the balance between the investments of these two shareholders in Renault, and on this occasion, to ensure the continuity and development of the Alliance, on February 4, 2016, Renault and the French State entered into a governance agreement aimed  at  restricting  the  free  exercise  of  the  French  State's  voting rights in respect of certain decisions submitted to Renault's Annual General Meeting.\n\nThis  limitation  varies  depending  on  the  quorum  achieved  at  the Annual General Meeting:\n\n- if the  shareholders  attending  or  represented  at  the  Annual P General  Meeting  in  question  own  maximum  70%  of  the  shares with  voting  rights  (either  single  or  double  voting  rights),  the French State's freely exercisable voting rights are capped at 17.9% of the voting rights exercisable; and\n- if the  shareholders  attending  or  represented  at  the  Annual P General  Meeting  in  question  own  more  than  70%  of  the  shares with  voting  rights  (either  single  or  double  voting  rights),  the French State's freely exercisable voting rights are capped at 20% of the voting rights exercisable.\n\nBeyond this applicable capping threshold, the French State's voting rights are exercised in a neutral way, i.e. :\n\n- at 50% in favor, and 50% against the adoption of ordinary resolutions; P\n- at 66\u2154% in favor, and 33\u2153% against the adoption of extraordinary P resolutions; and\n- in full for the adoption of resolutions requiring shareholder unanimity.

        "page_content": "## GLOSSARY\n\nA\n\nAlliance: Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi and AVTOVAZ are members of the  Alliance  (a  legal  structure  described  in  Section  1.2  of  this document),  with  a  cumulative  sales  volume  for  2016  of  over  9.9 million units.\n\nAVES: Alliance Vehicle Evaluation System. A system of quality checks conducted  on  new  vehicles  as  they  come  off  the  assembly  lines. AVES  applies  a  detailed  method  comprising  a  static/visual component  and  a  dynamic  component  to  detect  any  visual  or mechanical defects or abnormal noises.\n\nAVTOVAZ: Russian  company,  manufacturer  of  the  Lada  brand  in which  Renault  has  a  controlling  interest,  via  a  joint-venture,  fully consolidated in Renault's financial statements since the end of 2016.\n\n## C\n\nCAFE: the 'CAFE' (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) represents the average level of fuel consumption or CO2 emissions for all passenger cars sold by a carmaker.\n\nCMF: Common  Module  Family,  a  sharing  principle,  via  a  series  of platforms shared between Renault and Nissan, based on a modular system of architecture that enables a wide range of vehicles to be built  from  a  smaller  pool  of  parts,  creating  higher  added-value  for the Group's customers.\n\nCCT: Cross-Company  Team,  a  team  consisting  of  representatives from  Renault  and  Nissan  who  explore  opportunities  for  synergies between the two companies within the framework of the Alliance.\n\nCVT: Continuously Variable Transmission. A gearbox technology that enables the vehicle to run at optimum power. A CVT delivers better fuel  economy  than  a  conventional  automatic  transmission.  It provides  a  smoother,  more  comfortable  driving  experience  by shifting seamlessly through gear ratios with no break in acceleration.\n\n## D\n\nDPF: Diesel  Particulate  Filter:  a  particulate  filter  removes  diesel particulate  matter  from  exhaust  gases  by  trapping  them  in  a microporous  honeycomb  structure.  The  filter  is  automatically regenerated every 500 km.\n\nDownsizing: reduction  in  engine  capacity.  Optimizing  internal combustion  engines  remains  one  of  the  most  effective  ways  of limiting fuel consumption, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions. Downsizing involves reducing the capacity of the engines - and thus fuel consumption and CO2 emissions -while maintaining performance.\n\nE\n\nEBA: emergency  brake  assist,  a  system  that  detects  emergency braking situations and instantaneously increases braking pressure to shorten the distance the vehicle takes to stop.\n\nEuro  NCAP: European  New  Car  Assessment  Program.  Safety standards for crash tests in Europe.\n\nEuro  NCAP  performs  crash  tests  to  give  consumers  precise information about the safety of their cars.\n\nSince 2009, Euro NCAP has released a single overall rating for each vehicle  tested,  which  comprises  assessments  of  Adult  Occupant Protection,  Child  Occupant  Protection,  Pedestrian  Protection  and Safety  Assist.  Euro  NCAP  also  publishes  information  about  ESC fitment and the results of rear impact (whiplash) tests in terms of seat design.\n\nEuro 5 and Euro 6: the  Euro  5  emission  standards  are  part  of  the Euro emission standards, which set the maximum pollutant emission limits, excluding CO2, for cars and other vehicles. The Euro 5 emission standard  came  into  effect  in  September  2009  for  new  car certifications  and  covers  all  new  cars  since  January  2011.  In  2014, Euro 6, which focuses mainly on NOx emissions, took its place.\n\nF\n\nFCF: Free Cash Flow is the amount of cash generated by a company after interest payments, tax and net investments. FCF is used to:\n\n- reduce the Net Financial Debt of Automotive; P\n- pay dividends; P\n- buy back the company's own shares and minority interests; P\n- carry out external growth operations: acquire companies or make P investments in associated companies.\n\nThe  FCF  for  Automotive  sectors  is  an  indicator  defined  by  Groupe Renault and calculated from the accounting data in the Statement of Changes  in  Cash.  However,  this  indicator  is  neither  defined  in  nor required by IFRS.\n\nThe Group has chosen to calculate this indicator on the scope of the Automotive sectors, excluding all elements from the Sales Financing sector, with the exception of dividends paid and capital increases in Sales Financing.\n\nFree Cash Flow is obtained from the elements in the Statement of Changes in Cash for Automotive sectors by summing the following elements:\n\nCash  flow  (excluding  dividends  received  from  publicly  listed companies and including dividends received from Sales Financing)\n\n- + Change in working capital requirements\n- + Tangible and intangible investments net of disposals\n- + Change in capitalized leased assets (vehicles and batteries)\n- - Subscription to capital increases from Sales Financing\n- = Automotive segments' operational free cash flow\n\nI",

It is 14 times lighter than air. In a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen are brought into contact on either  side  of  a  polymer  electrolyte  membrane.  They  combine  to produce water, the only 'emission' of the engine, which generates electricity  and  heat.  It  is  this  electrical  energy  that  powers  the vehicle's electric engine.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGEC: The  Group  Executive  Committee,  which  is  in  charge  of  the Company's strategic directions and decisions, was renamed Board of Management (BoM) in January 2021.\n\nGroupe Renault: building on its alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors,  and  its  unique  expertise  in  electrification,  the  Groupe Renault relies on the complementarity of its five brands - Renault, Dacia,  Lada,  Alpine  and  Mobilize  -  and  offers  its  customers sustainable  and  innovative  mobility  solutions.  With  operations  in more than 130 countries, it now has more than 170,000 employees and sold 2.95 million vehicles in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nH\n\nHSE: Renault created an HSE division (Health, Safety, Environment) on  September  1,  2016.  Its  task  is  to  converge  policies  on  working conditions, health, safety and the environment. The task of this new entity  is  to  carry  out  the  Group's  HSE  governance  by  defining  an overall policy and ambitious progress targets in respect of safety and working conditions, ergonomics, industrial health and the environment in collaboration with corresponding functions.\n\n## K\n\nKPI: Key  performance  indicators.  KPIs  are  used  to  measure  the Company's  performance.  They  provide  an  overview  of  the  Group's performance,  which  is  reported  monthly  to  the  GEC.  KPIs  are  the main tool for performance management in each geographical region or business line.\n\nL\n\nLAB: Laboratory  of  Accidentology,  Biomechanics  and  Human Behavior. The LAB reflects will to improve road safety by combining several scientific disciplines at the crossroads between physics and human  sciences.  The  accidentology  and  driver  behavior  teams analyze  the  causes  and  effects  of  road  accidents  with  a  view  to improving prevention. The biomechanics team works toward better occupant protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM\n\nMateriality  Matrix: the  Materiality  matrix  is  a  tool  which  enables prioritization  of  extra-financial  stakes  with  strategic  reach.  By conducting  a  materiality  analysis,  the  Company  works  on  the subjects that have a (potentially) extensive and significant impact on its business model, and then translate these (as far as possible) into indicators. The  methodology  used  must  be  comprehensible, reproducible and transparent.\n\nThe Monozukuri is the indicator that measures performance growth for  the  Purchasing,  Warranty,  R&D,  Production  and  Logistics business activities over the current year versus the previous year. It is  calculated  excluding  changes  in  raw  materials,  mix  effects, enrichment, volume and currencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nN\n\nNEDC: the  NEDC  (New  European  Driving  Cycle)  is  a  standardized driving cycle and test procedure used to measure the emission levels and fuel economy of all types of vehicles in Europe. The NEDC is thus an  objective  criterion  for  assessing  the  performance  of  models  by different manufacturers. The vehicle is put on a roller test bench and put  through  the  same  urban  cycle  three  times  (cycle  ECE-15), followed by one non-urban cycle. The average of the four cycles is the average fuel economy.\n\nO\n\nOpen Innovation Lab: the creation of Open Innovation Labs is part of  the  Renault-Nissan  Alliance's  innovation  culture  and  strategy: they  enable  innovation  opportunities  to  be  cultivated  based  on  an open  eco-system  comprising  start-ups,  universities  and  investors and  a  local  economy  such  as  local  authorities,  associations, customers  and  markets.  These  laboratories  bring  together  in  one place  the  three  pillars  of  open  innovation:  the  socialization  of knowledge  (events,  conferences,  think  tanks,  meet-ups),  creativity and  innovative  design  methods  (design  thinking,  Fablab)  and  new economy  leveraging  (acceleration  of  start-ups,  collaborative  and open  modes  and  platforms).  Since  March  2017,  there  are  three around the world (Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv and Paris).\n\nOperating income: includes all revenues and costs directly related to the  Group's  activities,  whether  recurrent  or  resulting  from  nonrecurring  decisions  or  operations,  such  as  restructuring  costs  (see operating margin).",

        "page_content": "Operating  margin: the  operating  margin  corresponds  to  the operating income before taking into account other operating income and  expenses  which  by  nature  or  exception  have  a  significant unusual  character  and  may  affect  margin  comparisons.  Other operating income and expenses mainly include:\n\n- restructuring  provisions  associated  with  activity  stoppages  and P the costs of workforce adjustment measures;\n- income  from  disposals  of  activities  or  operational  investments P (total  or  partial),  the  income  from  disposals  of  investments  in associates and joint ventures (total or partial), other income from changes  in  scope  such  as  takeovers  under  IFRS  10  of  entities previously  consolidated  under  the  equity  method  and  the  direct acquisition costs of companies consolidated by full consolidation or  according  to  the  percentage  share  specific  to  each  balance sheet and income statement item;\n- gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment and P intangible assets (except leased asset sales);\n- impairment  of  intangible  assets  and  property,  plant  and P equipment  and  goodwill  (excluding  goodwill  from  associated companies and joint ventures);\n- income and expenses that are unusual in their frequency, nature P or  amount,  in  respect  of  disputes  or  impairment  on  significant operating receivables.\n\nOyak-Renault: Renault's manufacturing partner in Turkey.\n\nP\n\nPGE: State-guaranteed loan ( Pr\u00eat garanti par l'\u00c9tat ).\n\n## R\n\nR&AE: Research  and  Advanced  Engineering.  R&AE  activities  are managed  across  the  company's  Engineering  departments  using  a shared,  structured  plan.  The  plan  covers  all  vehicle,  powertrain, product, process and service applications.\n\nREACH: (for Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of CHemicals)  is  a  regulation  adopted  in  2006  by  the  European Parliament and Council. It has enabled the creation of a Community system for the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemical substances  managed  by  the  new  European  Chemicals  Agency (ECHA) based in Helsinki.\n\nThe implementation of REACH is the result of three main intentions: to expand knowledge of the health and environmental risks of over 30,000 chemical substances, to implement a substitution policy for the  most  harmful  substances  and  to  entrust  manufacturing  and exporting companies with the evaluation and management of risks linked to these substances.\n\nRevenues: revenues include all income from the sale of the Group's automotive products, less rebates for services linked to these sales, and  the  different  sales  financing  revenues  sold  to  customers  by Group companies.\n\nRMC: Regional  Management Committee, which represents most of the  Company's  central  business  functions,  meets  monthly  and contributes to growing the Company's presence, in both volume and market share, in the markets of the region in question. GEC: Group Executive Committee, which is in charge of the Company's strategic directions and decisions.\n\nRNPO: Renault-Nissan Purchasing Organization, Shared Renault and Nissan  division,  created  in  2001,  responsible  for  purchasing  parts and all other activities for the two companies.\n\nROCE (Return On Capital Employed): is  an indicator that measures the profitability of invested capital\n\n## S\n\nShareholders'  equity: the  Group  manages  the  equity  for  the Automotive division excluding AVTOVAZ using a ratio, equal to net debt for the Automotive segment excluding AVTOVAZ divided by the amount of shareholders' equity. Net financial indebtedness includes all non-operating interest-bearing financial liabilities and commitments  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  other  nonoperating  financial  assets  such  as  marketable  securities  or  the segment's loans. Shareholders' equity is as reported in the Group's financial position.\n\n## T\n\nTAM: Total  Automotive  Market.  The  TAM  is  an  aggregate  figure representing new registrations of all automotive brands in the same market.  TAM  is  frequently  used  in  conjunction  with  Market  Share (MS).\n\nTCe: Turbo Control Efficiency. TCe engines are equipped with a low inertia turbo that ensures minimal lag, thanks to its small-diameter turbine  and  compressor.  The  marriage  of  small  capacity  and  low inertia turbo ensures lively response from low revs.\n\n## W\n\nWLTP: Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure. In the vehicle approval process, WLTP is the new procedure for measuring CO2  emissions  and  pollutant  consumption  and  emissions  under conditions  more  representative  of  customer  use  and  the  diverse nature  of  vehicle  equipment.  It  has  gradually  been  replacing  the NEDC procedure since September 1, 2017. In line with the Euro 6d standard, which has gradually been implemented since September 1, 2017,  this  standard  laboratory  test  procedure  is  supplemented  by road tests that use the new Real Driving Emissions (RDE) protocol.\n\nI",
