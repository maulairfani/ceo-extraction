Our employee and customer Net Promoter Scores have reached historic highs while we further improved our financial performance. We achieved carbon neutrality and increased our leadership in connected, LED and conventional lighting while successfully integrating Cooper Lighting and Klite.' - Eric Rondolat, Signify CEO\n\n2020 presented challenges the likes of which we've never experienced. As a company, we responded quickly to the conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. From early in February, we were very agile and thorough in dealing with the challenges through global and local crisis response teams. I am proud that, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our crisis response teams and the worldwide disciplined execution of health and safety recommendations, we achieved our priority objective to protect our people.\n\nIn this extraordinary year, we also managed to further improve our profitability and free cash flow, even against the backdrop of a decline in demand. We took a range of impactful actions, including solid price management, rigorous working capital management, curtailment of uncommitted\n\nand nonessential capital expenditures, and a reduction of our overall gross debt position.\n\nIt is with a lot of pride that we announced that we achieved carbon neutrality across our entire operations in September, that we now use 100% renewable electricity and send zero waste to landfill. Our new Brighter Lives Better World 2025 program, launched this year, also reinforces that sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. It is our compass for driving growth opportunities that will create long-term value for our stakeholders and double our positive impact on the environment and society in the coming five years.\n\n## Our strategic focus\n\nOur employees' resilience in implementing our strategy helped us to strengthen our leadership position in connected, LED,",

Meanwhile, WiZ further expanded smart home lighting accessibility as it launched more than 100 products that are easy to set-up with Bluetooth and consumers' existing WiFi networks.\n\nThe progress we've made in the past few years uniquely positions us to achieve technology-driven growth across multiple dimensions.\n\n## Our commitment to sustainability\n\nIn September, we reached a major milestone: becoming carbon neutral in all our operations across the world. This was ahead of our target and ahead of the aspirations set out in the Paris Agreement. This is a truly significant achievement for us. Following this milestone, I am very proud to announce that, at the end of 2020, we also outperformed on many of our ambitious commitments set out in our sustainability program.\n\nHowever, the world is still facing demographic change, urbanization, climate change and resource scarcity. Now is the time, as a society, to be even more ambitious and accelerate our efforts to address these challenges.\n\nAs a company, we will go beyond carbon neutrality and double our positive impact on the environment and on society in the\n\n## Our commitment to innovation\n\nIn 2020, we invested 4.4% of our sales in R&D. We specifically increased our investments in UV-C, solar lighting, and connected home lighting.\n\nWe leveraged more than 35 years of expertise in UV-C lighting to address the growing global need for the disinfection of air, surfaces and objects. Our UV-C technology is proven to effectively neutralize microorganisms, such as bacteria, mold and viruses - including the virus that causes COVID-19 - in a matter of seconds. 1 We increased our UV-C light source production capacity by a factor of 8 this year, launched 12 families of UV-C-based products for professionals, and also started launching UV-C products for consumers. As such it's an important part of our commitment to health and safety.\n\nThe release of solar hybrid systems is increasing the number of places where solar lighting can be used, as it allows switching between solar power during the sunnier periods and power from the grid during the darker months. This will help increase the usage of clean electricity and reduce carbon footprints. This is an essential part of our commitment to clean energy.\n\nAnother groundbreaking innovation is helping to further enhance the home entertainment experience. The Philips Hue Play gradient lightstrip brings the surround\n\nIn 2020, we implemented our 5 Frontiers strategy. It helps us address the challenges and seize the opportunities from the major global shifts we see. We aim to be even more customer centric, deliver differentiated offers, drive growth for sustainability, digitalize and transform for the future and be a great place to work.\n\n## Our acquisitions\n\nOur acquisition of Cooper Lighting Solutions, completed in March 2020, strengthens our position in the attractive North American lighting market.Our focus is on building a winning common culture, deploying finance and HR processes, learning platforms, and creating a common IT backbone. The integration is ahead of plan and we've identified an additional USD 40 million of synergies, bringing the total to USD 100 million. Despite the shortfall in top line due to the pandemic, we have been delivering in absolute value the profit and cash as per our acquisition business plan.\n\nIn 2020, we also further strengthened our position in the private and branded label markets, stemming from the independent supply chain we secured in China by acquiring Klite in 2019. The integration between the teams has been extremely fast and a great solidarity was shown when our plants stayed closed in early Q1. Despite the slow start of the year due to the pandemic in China, synergies are already leading to improved cost competitiveness and working capital improvement.\n\n## Our financial performance\n\nWhile our industry was severely impacted by the pandemic, we managed to strengthen our financial performance. Our gross margin increased due to rigorous price and cost management, resulting in our seventh consecutive year of Adjusted EBITA margin improvement. From the start of the crisis, we were disciplined in working capital management, allowing us to generate a record-high free cash flow of EUR 817 million.\n\nAs per our strategy, the contribution from our digital divisions increased substantially in 2020. In line with our governance principles, we decided to return contributions to employees who participated in the 2020 solidarity prgram and to propose an extraordinary dividend to our shareholders, who have supported us since the beginning of the crisis. At the same time, we confirmed a continued deleveraging commitment.\n\nAt the end of the year, we started further optimizing our costs in several ways to enhance our competitiveness in a rapidly transforming lighting industry. We are making our central organization leaner in order to reduce our indirect costs, which have increased as a percentage of sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, we will continue to innovate and develop our growth platforms to capture new business opportunities in line with our strategy.",

This program is all about doubling: doubling the pace at which we will achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement; doubling our circular revenues; doubling our brighter lives revenues that benefit society; and doubling the percentage of women in leadership - all within the next five years.\n\nFor us, we've had sustainability at the heart of our purpose for more than a decade since we actively drove the ban of incandescent lighting and led the shift to LED and connected lighting. And every year that purpose is coming more and more to life through what we propose to our customers and how we operate our company.\n\n## Our commitment to our customers\n\nCustomer satisfaction is at the center of our 5 Frontiers strategy and one of the main pillars of our Road to Excellence. 2020 was a successful year where we raised our Net Promoter Score from 32 in 2019 to 41. This is a benchmark achievement. Our efforts to\n\ndigitalize and improve the customer experience won two awards (Best Measurement in CX and Digital Transformation) at the Annual European Customer Centricity Awards 2020.\n\nWe have focused on failure prevention by strengthening Advanced Quality Planning and implementing lessons learned from the performance of our products in the field. This will lead to improvements in performance and will increase customer satisfaction even more.\n\nAs part of our commitment to the new European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) model, we have been performing assessments in several parts of the company. This program shows us where we have to increase our organizational maturity to become the industry benchmark.\n\n## Our digitalization journey\n\nThis year, we launched a multiyear digital roadmap, with prioritized initiatives based on market trends and customer needs.\n\nOne place we've focused our energy is the digitalization of customer interfaces. Some examples of this focus are our revamped Philips Hue website; the launch of LightFinder, a direct-to-consumer channel that makes it easier for consumers to find, choose, and buy the right lightbulb for their home; and improvements in MySignify, our B2B platform that helps our professional customers to navigate the entire journey from awareness to aftercare. We've also deployed clear initiatives throughout the organization to digitally reskill and upskill our employees, especially in data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, automation, e-commerce, and security.\n\n## Our commitment to being a great place to work\n\nIn 2020, our main priority was the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families. We made an early decision on all possible protective measures to provide our employees with a safe working environment. We also ensured all our sites were prepared for social distancing. At the\n\nsame time, we started to install UV-C disinfection upper air luminaires in some of our offices as part of our continued focus on providing safe working environments.\n\nAlso, during this extraordinary year, we continued our efforts to be a strong talent-building company. As part of being a great place to work we have launched our new internal careers website with both permanent as well as short-term assignments, and we launched a new digital global mentoring initiative 'mentoring without borders', providing all employees with the opportunity to mentor and be mentored virtually.\n\nOur succession plans for leadership roles continue to be robust and have become more diverse with 35% of succession candidates being women. In 2020, over 80% of our leadership positions were again staffed internally, confirming the success of our efforts to build a strong internal succession pipeline.",

Our Employee NPS showed another step change, from 20 in Q4 2019 to 29 in Q4 2020, with participation levels above 80% throughout the year.\n\n## Our Board of Management\n\nThis year, we strengthened our Board of Management with two new faces. First of all, Maria Letizia Mariani, who had already served as Chief Marketing Officer & Head of Strategy, and Division Leader for Conventional Products, officially joined the Board of Management in May. Later in the year, Francisco Javier van Engelen Sousa joined us as Chief Financial Officer and also as a member of the Board of Management.\n\nRen\u00e9 van Schooten, who joined then-Philips at the turn of the millennium and has been a member of the Board of Management since the IPO in May 2016, has stepped down from our Board at the end of the year.

But the facility didn't have any windows. Therefore, a high-quality lighting system able to service and adapt to the intensive lighting needs of different crops was needed.\n\n## Solution\n\nSignify fulfi lled this need by providing a combination of Philips GreenPower LED toplights and Philips GreenPower LED interlights. With this mix, the light comes in both from the top and right into the canopy where the light for photosynthesis is needed most.\n\n'As our building had no windows, we needed a high-quality lighting system to fulfi l the intensive lighting requirements of tomatoes and cucumbers. Signify provided its Philips GreenPower LED grow lighting, helping us to achieve a yield performance comparable to traditional greenhouse operations.' Vladimir Bukharev, Director at RIAT\n\nRIAT can also tailor the light recipes to the specifi c needs of the different crops - from a variety of lettuces to herbs, cucumbers, radishes and arugula.\n\nThis adaptability has helped RIAT to grow high-quality crops and achieve a yield performance that's comparable to traditional greenhouse operations.\n\nMoreover, growing indoors means RIAT can use a central location, keeping distribution lines short, ensuring its products make it to the store within an hour of harvesting and providing shoppers with some of the freshest produce available. This allows RIAT to sell 99% of what it grows.\n\n## Philips GreenPower LEDs\n\nPhilips GreenPower LEDs are an important tool in improving a crop's growth predictability, quality and yield, year round, helping facilities to get more and higher quality produce per m 2 than ever before. The light recipes can be adjusted to service the lighting needs of different crops. As such, horticulture LEDs can be very useful in improving food availability around produce 70% more food in the next 15 years\n\nthe globe, which is a necessity as we need to just to feed our growing population.",

In addition to creating a platform for smart city deployments across the state, this conversion cuts energy usage and lowers emissions. The program aims to replace at least half of New York's more than one million streetlights over the next fi ve years.\n\n## Solution\n\nMore than 66,000 LED streetlights, managed by Signify's Interact City software, have been installed to date. This means savings of more than 68 million kWh and USD 11.5 million in energy costs per year. But municipalities don't just save money by adopting connected LED lighting. They also expand the value of their streetlight systems.\n\n'With Interact City, we can now remotely monitor the system via a central dashboard, identifying required maintenance very quickly. Should any glitch occur, the system proactively prompts managers even before our residents have noticed, and that's a big plus.' Abebe Woldemariam, Street lighting program coordinator, City of Rochester\n\nInteract City can share data collected via sensors with the IT systems of fi refi ghters, emergency medical services and other fi rst responders, enabling them to react more quickly when incidents occur. In addition, some of the streets will be equipped with BrightSites smart poles, which can be equipped with cellular equipment and WiFi transmitters, so citizens can enjoy the latest technology in connectivity.\n\nFurther, the project offers signifi cant social benefi ts. As Kathy Sheehan, Mayor of Albany, explains, 'As we looked at the technology and as we saw what was possible, it really became a social justice and equity issue, because it allows us to do a number of things that are really helpful to our communities.' With commitments from more than 30 cities to replace 250,000 streetlights, the program is almost halfway to its goal of converting 500,000 streetlights across the state by 2025.\n\n## Interact City\n\nThe Interact City connected lighting system and management software provides customers with a robust infrastructure to enhance city services, improve public safety, beautify public spaces, engage with citizens, and encourage civic pride. Collecting and analyzing data also reduces energy usage and cost, and increases effi ciency by enabling better maintenance planning and service delivery.",

In 2020, when most people spent more time at home than ever before, this idea became even more important. The global coronavirus pandemic created a need for ways to disinfect our homes and inactivate microorganisms like viruses and bacteria. But for the home to be truly safe, the product itself needed to have a number of safety features as well.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe Philips UV-C disinfection desk lamp, fi rst rolled out in Asia, disinfects rooms and effectively inactivates viruses, bacteria, molds and spores in a matter of minutes. It's small enough to be stored out of sight when not in use and easily moved between rooms, allowing an entire house to be disinfected on a rotating basis.\n\n'The UV-C desk lamp is highly effective in terms of killing germs and inactivating viruses and includes safe-to-use innovative features like radar detection and voice alert.' - Sau Hong Lim, Head of Consumer Customer Segment Management, Digital Products Division, Greater China\n\nAs UV-C light can be harmful to humans and animals, the UV-C disinfection desk lamp is equipped with several safety measures ensuring proper usage so it can do its job of providing that extra layer of protection. These include voice interaction to guide users through each usage, ensuring disinfection takes place successfully. And a built-in microwave sensor detects movement within a radius of three meters and automatically shuts off the desk lamp if any is detected. The best protection of course, is for people to make sure they leave the room, take pets with them, and close the door. Recommended cleaning times vary depending on the size of the room. But generally, a typical bathroom takes about 15 minutes, a bedroom 30 minutes, and a living room 45 minutes.\n\n## UV-C\n\nLeveraging more than 35 years of expertise in UV-C lighting, Signify has launched several consumer products to address the growing need for the disinfection of air, surfaces, and objects in people's homes. This in addition to increasing its production capacity of UV-C light sources eightfold and launching 12 product families for the professional market. This is how we're helping keep people safe in a world that's adjusting to a new normal.",

To make it work, they knew that they needed beautiful lighting that was highly customizable, connected, and scalable. With sustainability as one of their core values, they also sought a lighting solution with a small carbon footprint.\n\n## Solution\n\n350 3D-printed luminaries, custom designed to fi t the existing lighting fi xtures, were created to make this project a reality. These lights, paired with the Interact Retail lighting system,\n\n'Our new store concept uses set-up and colors to create a unique shopping story per section, with sustainable materials at their core. We wanted connected lighting in beautiful and highly customizable luminaires to suit this concept. This is exactly what 3D-printed luminaires can provide. High-quality connected lighting in tailor-made luminaires from recyclable materials. Moreover, Signify's designers made a signifi cant contribution to bringing our unique light concept to life.' Ton Beentjes, Project Manager, Detailresult Services\n\nallow the Dekamarkt supermarket to have centralized control over its lighting. This allows them to tailor the lighting to different sections of their supermarket, creating a dynamic shopping experience.\n\nThe system's ease of use and versatility, coupled with a strong sustainability profi le and cost-effectiveness, made the project a success. Because of this, Dekamarkt plans on implementing this concept in an additional 30 stores.\n\n## Interact Retail\n\nInteract Retail is a cloud-based, connected lighting system that supports new operational effi ciencies, enhances the store experience by creating stunning and fl exible spaces, and generates data for in-depth retail analytics. It also allows retailers to centralize their lighting management and reduce operational costs.\n\n## 3D Printing\n\nSignify's 3D-printed luminaries are built with sustainability in mind. The base material is a polycarbonate that is strong, highquality and 100% recyclable. Each order can be custom designed and tailored to the client's needs, saving time, energy, waste in manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The process illustrates that more complex and innovative designs can be aligned with the needs of a circular economy.",

Our focus is first and foremost on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers, partners and people around us. From the pandemic's outset, we put in place both central as well as local teams to monitor the situation and act appropriately given the advice of government and local authorities. This has led us to the closure of some plants, working from home, restrictions on travel, and stringent hygiene and health measures at our locations. We also increased our UV-C lighting capacity more than eightfold to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn order for our company to be resilient against the economic impact of the pandemic we implemented a range of financial measures. These included the withdrawal of the 2019 dividend, government support, which was limited, and a solidarity measures program where employees could opt to take a voluntary worktime reduction of 20%. In January 2021, in recognition of the sacrifice and solidarity of our people and shareholders, we announced that we will return the solidarity contribution to our employees and proposed an extraordinary dividend of EUR 1.35 per share, which is in line with the withdrawn dividend proposal for 2019.",

Overall, sales in the consumer channel have shown a solid performance in weak market conditions, specifically online sales.\n\nIncome from operations increased to EUR 269 million compared with EUR 215 million in 2019, driven by gross margin improvement, on top of positive mix from consumer connected growth. Adjusted EBITA amounted to EUR 295 million. This resulted in an improvement of the Adjusted EBITA margin of 210 basis points to 12.9%, a sign of Digital Products maturing in its profit margin profile. Free cash flow increased by EUR 166 million to EUR 406 million.\n\n## Market developments\n\nThere is a transition in both professional and consumer segments from LED lamps to functional LED luminaires and connected solutions, as anticipated in the company's strategy.

In 2021, Conventional Products will continue to execute its strategy and optimize free cash flow by leveraging the Division's cost advantage, scale, global footprint and lean manufacturing capabilities while responding to customer demand for conventional products and growing its UV-C lighting business by leveraging its decades-long expertise.\n\nincrease insourcing to Klite, the Chinabased manufacturing company in which Signify acquired a 51% stake in 2019.\n\n## Performance Conventional Products\n\n## About Conventional Products\n\nConventional Products is the global market leader in the conventional lighting business and comprises the company's conventional lamps and lamp electronics businesses. It produces and sells lamps, based on a wide variety of non-LED based technologies. This includes HID, TL, compact fluorescent, halogen, incandescent, as well as electronic components (electronic ballasts and drivers) and specialty lighting. Conventional lamps are used in a wide variety of residential and professional applications and are bought by consumers, electrical installers and professional end-users through a wide range of channels. Lamp electronics are mainly sold to luminaire manufacturers directly and as replacement products to electrical wholesalers. Finally, Conventional Products sells digital projection lamps and drivers to the OEM market and the replacement market.\n\n## Key figures Conventional Products\n\n## in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                                   | 2019     | 2020        |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|-------------|\n| Sales                             | 1,159    | 943         |\n| Nominal sales growth              | ( 18.8)% | ( 1 8.7 ) % |\n| Comparable sales growth  1        | (20.5)%  | (16.5)%     |\n| Income from operations  (or EBIT) | 168      | 149         |\n| EBITA  1                          | 168      | 149         |\n| Adjusted EBITA  1                 | 222      | 170         |\n| as a % of sales                   | 19.2%    | 18.0%       |\n| Free cash flow  1, 2              | 222      | 188         |\n| Number of employees  (in FTEs)  3 | 7,229    | 8,051       |\n\n- 1 For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, see chapter 18, Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures, of this Annual Report.\n- 2 Excluding non-allocated free cash flow items (e.g. tax, interest).\n- 3 2019 FTEs have been revised to conform with the current cost allocation model.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nConventional Products enables Signify to reach customers thanks to its long and strong commercial synergies and brand coverage. While the overall conventional market continues to decline, Conventional Products' focus is on winning market share in key segments and markets to remain the 'last company standing'. Conventional Products continues to proactively manage its manufacturing footprint and reduce operational costs to optimize free cash flow.\n\n## 2020 Business highlights\n\nOn top of LEDification, energy efficiency and legislation to ban certain conventional technologies remain important factors of the conventional market decline.\n\nConventional Products maintains a legislation-compliant portfolio and invests in remaining opportunities such as UV-C light sources and conventional horticulture lighting.\n\nThe Division is successfully executing its last company standing strategy, strengthening its leadership position by continuously gaining market share, increasing customer and employee Net Promoter Scores and delivering cash.\n\nAs part of its strategy, it is proactively managing its manufacturing footprint. Signify operated 11 manufacturing plants for conventional lamps at the end of 2020 compared with 45 at the end of 2008.\n\n## 2020 Financial performance\n\nSales for 2020 amounted to EUR 943 million, a decline of 18.7% on a nominal basis and 16.5% on a comparable basis. The rate of decline was reduced by strong demand for UV-C and horticulture lighting.\n\nIncome from operations reduced to EUR 149 million, due to the ongoing decrease in sales, partly offset by proactive rationalization of the manufacturing footprint and a reduction in indirect costs. Restructuring costs amounted to EUR 23 million and were mainly related to further optimization of the manufacturing footprint. Adjusted EBITA for 2020 decreased to EUR 170 million compared with EUR 222 million in 2019. The Adjusted EBITA margin remained robust at 18.0% in 2020.

This was primarily due to Signify's acquisitions in 2020. Employee engagement is measured through the employee Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our NPS improved in 2020, with a yearly average score of 25 (2019: 18). Our safety performance indicator (TRC rate) was 0.22 per 100 FTEs (0.32 in 2019). This is a 31% improvement from 2019 and we successfully met our 2020 target on safety.\n\n## Better World performance\n\nIn September 2020, we finalized our journey to carbon neutrality in our operations and our shift to 100% renewable electricity. As a manufacturing company, we still have unavoidable emissions. In 2020, our gross operational carbon footprint was 260 kilotonnes. This 28% decrease compared to 2019 can be explained by fewer emissions from logistics and business travel. At the end of 2020, 100% of manufacturing sites achieved our zero waste to landfill commitment (2019: 71%) and 91% of our total waste was recycled.\n\nThrough our global presence, we drive sustainability across 18 markets.\n\n## Sustainable performance per market\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                           | FTEs   | FTEs           | Manufacturing  sites  2   | Manufacturing  sites  2   | Safety   TRC rate  2   | Safety   TRC rate  2   |   CO 2  emitted  (kilotonnes) |   CO 2  emitted  (kilotonnes) | Waste   recycled  2   | Waste   recycled  2   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                           | 2019   | 2020           | 2019                      | 2020                      | 2019                   | 2020                   |                          2019 |                          2020 | 2019                  | 2020                  |\n| Europe                                    |        | 11,442  11,418 | 16                        | 14                        | 0.36                   | 0.23                   |                           119 |                           101 | 86%                   | 90%                   |\n| Benelux                                   | 3,294  | 3,163          | 5                         | 4                         | 0.41                   | 0.31                   |                            18 |                            12 | 82%                   | 87%                   |\n| Eastern Europe                            | 5,836  | 5,975          | 7                         | 7                         | 0.16                   | 0.11                   |                            73 |                            70 | 87%                   | 90%                   |\n| DACH (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland)  | 401    | 388            | -

Companies active in the market include traditional lighting companies as well as companies, mainly based in Asia, that entered the market with the advent of LED technology. The introduction of connected lighting brought new competitors to the market.\n\nWhile Signify is active in 74 countries, competition in the market for lamps tends to be more global while competition in the market for luminaires is more regional in nature. The market for conventional lighting declines and competitor focus is on managing this decline. The market for LED lighting continues to grow and sees competition around product offerings, customer use cases, pricing and innovation.\n\n## 4.3 Proposed distribution to shareholders\n\nPursuant to Article 10 of the Articles of Association of Signify N.V., a dividend will first be declared on preference shares out of net income. The remainder of the net income, after reservations made with the approval of the Supervisory Board, shall be available for distribution to holders of ordinary shares subject to shareholder approval after year-end. As of December 31, 2020, the issued share capital consists only of ordinary shares; no preference shares have been issued. Under Article 10 of the Articles of Association of Signify N.V., the Board of Management can determine what portion of the net income shall be retained by way of reserve, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nSignify proposes to declare a cash dividend of EUR 1.40 per share for 2020. This is in addition to the extraordinary cash dividend of EUR 1.35 per share, announced on January 13, 2021. The amount of extraordinary dividend is in line with the dividend proposal of EUR 1.35 for 2019, which was withdrawn to ensure the company's resilience and to strengthen its financial position during the COVID-19 crisis. Both dividend proposals will be subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) to be held on May 18, 2021.\n\nThe balance sheet presented in this report, as part of the company financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2020, is before appropriation of the result for the financial year 2020.\n\n## 4.4 Outlook\n\nSignify is committed to the following medium-term guidance for the period 2021-2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Yearly comparable sales growth of 0% to 5%\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA margin of 11% to 13% in 2023\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow above 8% of sales for the period 2021-2023\n- \u00b7 ROCE of at least 11% for the period 2021-2023\n\nFor 2021, Signify expects positive comparable sales growth, the level of which will depend on the recovery pattern in its markets. In addition, the company expects to continue its steady progress towards its medium-term Adjusted EBITA margin objective. Cash flow, following two years of significant structural working capital improvements, is expected to exceed 8% of sales. As guided for the mid-term, this includes a higher initial cash outflow for cost restructuring and continued postmerger integration activities.\n\n## 4.5 Organizational structure\n\nEffective Q2 2020, to further adapt to the industry transition and strengthen customer centricity, Signify changed the organizational structure, which included changing the previously four business groups (BG's) to three divisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Division Digital Solutions is the former BG Professional, including Cooper Lighting.\n- \u00b7 Division Digital Products combines BG LED and BG Home, including WiZ.\n- \u00b7 Division Conventional Products is the former BG Lamps.\n\n'Other' represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes certain costs related to central R&D activities to drive innovation as well as group enabling functions. With this new structure, the company created one global operations team to drive customer and business excellence.\n\nAs the pandemic is expected to have a long term impact on the lighting market, Signify communicated in January 2021 a further plan that aims to optimize cost and enhance competitiveness by making its central organization leaner. It intends to remove its current market group layer and organize its markets in clusters. These organizational changes are currently subject to works council proceedings.",

The AGM also re-appointed Arthur van der Poel and Rita Lane. The Supervisory Board currently consists of six independent members.\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board had three committees that cover key areas in greater detail: an Audit Committee, a Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, and a Remuneration Committee. As of January 1, 2021, the Supervisory Board established the Digital Committee. The charters of each of the committees are published on the company's website.\n\n## 8  Supervisory Board report\n\n## Letter from the Chair\n\nI am pleased to present our Supervisory Board report for 2020.\n\nThe year 2020 was an extraordinary year with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting us all. The company responded quickly and set up crisis response teams early in the year. As a Supervisory Board, we had additional discussions on COVID-19 developments, the response of the business, and the protection of the health and safety of employees. We are pleased with how the Board of Management handled and is handling the COVID-19 crisis, showing determination from the start despite the many uncertainties. In financial terms, and against a decreasing demand, the company was able to achieve a robust financial performance in 2020.\n\nAt the same time, the company continued to achieve its sustainability goals and completed its first five-year program over performing on most of its ambitious commitments. This shows that sustainability is truly an integral part of Signify's strategy.\n\nThe company also closed the acquisition of Cooper Lighting in 2020. The Supervisory Board made a virtual acquaintance with the team and the business and looks forward to visiting the Cooper Lighting premises when circumstances allow again.",

As of January, Mr. Lubnau joined meetings as a guest (not included in the table).\n\nEach of the Supervisory Board committees regularly convened and reported back on their activities to the full Supervisory Board. In addition, the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the CEO are in regular contact on a variety of matters. Our members also individually interacted with members of the Board of Management and with senior management outside the formal Supervisory Board meetings. Whenever one of our members wanted to be informed on a specific topic, he or she requested this, and follow-up was provided by the Board of Management or senior management.\n\nThere were no apparent conflicts of interest of material significance in 2020, which would have called for one of the members not to participate in the decision-making.\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board discussed a range of topics, including:\n\n## \u00b7 COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented situation globally. End March, we organized an additional Supervisory Board meeting for an in-depth discussion on COVID-19 developments, its potential impact and actions that management had taken and intended to take. We approved the proposed suspension of the company's financial outlook for 2020 and the withdrawal of the dividend proposal. The Supervisory Board members appreciated the voluntary 20% pay reduction for Q2 that the company's leadership team took and decided to also reduce its fees by 20% for Q2. Subsequently, a vast majority of Signify's global employees voluntarily supported a 20% worktime reduction and pro-rata payment for Q2.\n\nEventually, the company's financial performance in 2020 enabled it to return contributions to employees who participated in the above solidarity program; the pay reduction for the leadership team and Supervisory Board remains in place. The Supervisory Board approved the proposal to declare an extraordinary dividend and supported the deleverage intention that Signify announced on January 13, 2021.\n\nThroughout 2020, the Supervisory Board was kept updated on developments around COVID-19, both through additional calls and as a recurring item on the Supervisory Board meeting agenda, focusing on people, security, operations and commercial. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the company will remain on the Supervisory Board's agenda in 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 Strategy, objectives and innovation On an ongoing basis, we have had\n\nin-depth discussions on industry trends\n\n## 8.2 Key discussion topics and meetings in 2020\n\n## Meetings and information\n\nThe Supervisory Board held ten meetings in 2020 as well as additional calls to discuss COVID-19 developments. While we were able to organize in-person meetings twice, in view of COVID-19, most meetings were held via video conference calls. The Supervisory Board and committee meetings were well attended, with an attendance rate of 100% of each Supervisory Board member.",

For more information on risk management and the company's business control framework, refer to chapter 12, Risk factors and risk management, of this Annual Report.\n\n## \u00b7 M&A\n\nIn March 2020, the company completed the acquisition of Cooper Lighting strengthening its position in the North American lighting market. Throughout the year, the Supervisory Board discussed the performance and integration of Cooper Lighting and other recent acquisitions, such as WiZ Connected and the 51% stake in Klite Lighting (both completed in 2019). We also paid specific attention to matters relating to the Cooper Lighting acquisition, such as the purchase price allocation assessment and the inclusion of the Cooper Lighting figures in the company's overall financials. As part of our standing agenda, we also discussed other pending and potential acquisitions and divestments.\n\nWe had planned for the Supervisory Board to visit the Cooper Lighting facilities in September 2020, though this was not possible due to the COVID-19 situation and travel restrictions. Instead, the Cooper Lighting management team presented Cooper Lighting to the Supervisory Board via a videoconference and the visit is envisaged to take place in 2021 if circumstances allow.\n\nas well as opportunities and risks related to the Signify business model. We have reviewed, challenged, and advised the Board of Management on the company's implementation of its strategic plan and strategic priorities throughout the year.\n\nIn September 2020, we had our annual dedicated session on the company's strategic plan and updates thereto. As part of this session, we discussed market developments, the competitive landscape and the company's current position, progress on strategic initiatives and sustainability goals, as well as the company's strategy for the coming years. This session was complemented by deep dives on Solar, Agriculture, Digital, UV-C, LiFi, 3D printing, software tools and capabilities as well as Innovation return on investment.\n\nThe strategic plan discussion was followed by a session in November in which management presented the strategic plan together with its mediumterm financial objectives. We also discussed and approved the company's targets for 2021 within the context of its 2021 operating plan.\n\nAs part of the November meeting, the company's innovation department gave demonstrations of recent and future technologies being developed.\n\n## \u00b7 Business performance\n\nEach quarter, we discussed the company's business performance in detail. These discussions included updates on the company's financial\n\nperformance, cost reduction initiatives, developments in working capital, the level of inventories, the performance of Cooper Lighting, the progress on key performance indicators of Signify and forecasts.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, the lighting market and scenarios for recovery and growth. We discussed the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's sales growth and actions taken to protect the company's profitability and cash, as well as opportunities for UV-C lighting.\n\n## \u00b7 Financial reporting\n\nWe discussed the quarterly results and the (semi-)annual financial statements for 2020, including related reports from the internal and external auditors and non-financial information.\n\n## \u00b7 Sustainability\n\nDuring the year, we were updated on the company's sustainability and corporate social responsibility programs and progress made towards their respective goals.\n\nThe company's first five-year sustainability program was completed in 2020, and it launched its new sustainability program Brighter Lives, Better World 2025. We are impressed by Signify's achievements under its first program. Viewing the initial reactions to the launch of the new program, we are pleased to see that the market\n\nacknowledges that sustainability is an integral part of the company and trusts that the company will achieve the ambitious targets set. We wholeheartedly support the new program and share this trust.\n\nMore information is provided in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, of this Annual Report.\n\n## \u00b7 Digitalization\n\nThis year, the company launched a multiyear digital roadmap with prioritized initiatives based on market trends and customer needs. In a dedicated session we discussed the company's digital strategy, roadmap and activities in depth. In view of the importance of digitalization, especially in the coming few years, the Supervisory Board established a Digital Committee from its midst as of January 1, 2021. See also sub-section 8.3.4, Digital Committee.\n\n## \u00b7 Organizational structure\n\nThe Supervisory Board discussed the change of the company's organizational structure from four Business Groups to three Divisions, effective Q2 2020. It also discussed the intended organizational changes to adapt to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See chapter 4.5, Organizational Structure, of this Annual Report for more information.\n\n## \u00b7 Risk management and internal controls\n\n- We discussed the company's risk management and internal controls, including any significant changes and improvements thereto.

With the Chief Legal Officer and the Board of Management, the Committee discussed developments in larger legal cases together with the related provisions as well as pending material investigations together with actions taken. With the Head of Tax and the Board of Management the Committee discussed current tax matters, including the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The Head of Compliance presented its annual compliance report over the past year, and key observations were discussed with the Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the internal audit plan and programs for each quarter. It also reviewed the internal audit charter, yearly audit plan (its scope and materiality, coverage in relation to that of the external audit plan), as well as the functioning, budget, staffing, independence and organizational structure of the internal audit function. With the Board of Management and the Head of Internal Audit, the Committee discussed the company's business control framework and any significant changes and improvements thereto; this framework sets the standard for risk management and business controls in the company. The effectiveness of the internal controls was discussed, and the results of the annual test concluded positive. The Audit Committee also reviewed its own charter.\n\n## \u00b7 Debt financing and deleverage\n\nIn January 2020, the company refinanced its term loans of EUR 740 million and USD 500 million, which would mature in May 2021, and its revolving credit facility of EUR 500 million. In September 2020, the company repaid EUR 350 million of the term loans under the new financing facilities. The Supervisory Board discussed and approved the new financing facilities and the subsequent deleverage.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also approved the issue of Eurobonds. The company issued these Eurobonds in May 2020 to refinance the bridge loan that was used to finance the acquisition of Cooper Lighting.\n\n## \u00b7 Capital Markets Day and investor relations\n\nIn December 2020, Signify organized its first Capital Markets Day. The Supervisory Board was involved in the preparation hereof.\n\nFrom time to time, management updated us on the company's share price development and analyst recommendations, interactions with shareholders and analysts as well as updates in the shareholder base.\n\n## \u00b7 Capital allocation policy\n\nWe reviewed the capital allocation policy of the company. In this context we also discussed expectations related to cash generation, dividend distributions, return of the contribution to employees who participated in the solidarity program,\n\ninvestments in innovation and M&A, share repurchases to cover obligations arising from Signify's long-term incentive and other employee share plans, deleverage as well as implications for credit ratings.\n\n## \u00b7 Talent management\n\nThe company's human resources department presented its annual update on talent management to us. We also discussed the performance and succession planning of employees who are in key positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.3\n\nKey activities of the Supervisory Board committees in 2020\n\n## 8.3.1 Audit Committee\n\nOur Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for, amongst other matters, the quality and integrity of the company's financial statements, the internal business controls and risk management systems, the internal and external audit as well as monitoring compliance.\n\nJill Lee chaired the Audit Committee until she stepped down from the Supervisory\n\nBoard on her own request on July 31, 2020. Thereafter, Pamela Knapp took over as Chair. Gerard van de Aast and Eelco Blok are, and were throughout 2020, the other members of this Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee met five times in 2020, upon the conclusion of each quarter and additionally in December. A combined meeting of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee took place in February 2020 to review and approve the company's 2019 annual report. The Audit Committee reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after every meeting. The CEO, CFO, Group Controller, Chief Accountant, Head of Internal Audit, Chief Legal Officer and external auditor (Ernst & Young Accountants LLP) generally attend Audit Committee meetings. At the end of each meeting, the Committee holds a private session separately with the external auditor, without members of management being present. The Head of Internal Audit is invited to this private session from time to time. The Committee Chair also has regular contact with the CFO, the Head of Internal Audit and the external auditor outside of Committee meetings.\n\nIn 2020, the Audit Committee received well prepared information from management and the external auditor on a variety of topics related to the company's financials, reporting policies, controls, practices, and compliance. As part of its standing agenda, the Audit Committee discussed the company's periodic financial statements and related press releases. It also discussed with the Head of Internal Audit and the Board of Management major areas of risk",

In addition, the Committee discussed developments in the Dutch corporate governance landscape and the company's corporate governance structure. It also discussed the Committee's own charter.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee specifically dedicated time to the following matters:\n\n## \u00b7 Composition Board of Management\n\nThe 2020 AGM re-appointed CEO Eric Rondolat and appointed Maria Letizia Mariani to the Board of Management, both for a term of four years. When the company's CFO St\u00e9phane Rougeot left in March 2020, the Supervisory Board asked Ren\u00e9 van Schooten to stay for another year to take up the role as CFO on an interim basis, until a new CFO had been found. The 2020 AGM re-appointed Ren\u00e9 to the Board of Management for one year. The Supervisory Board, upon preparation of the Committee, started a selection process to find a new CFO and Javier van Engelen joined the company in June 2020. He was appointed to the Board of Management by the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders in October 2020 for a term of four years.\n\nIn 2020, the Audit Committee also dedicated time to the following matters:\n\n## \u00b7 Re-appointment external auditor and rotation lead auditor\n\nUpon proposal of the Audit Committee and subsequently the Supervisory Board, the 2020 AGM re-appointed Ernst & Young Accountants LLP for a period of three years (2020 - 2022). As the lead auditor in charge of Signify must rotate every five years, a new lead auditor from Ernst & Young Accountants LLP will oversee the Signify account as of the financial year 2021.\n\n## \u00b7 Annual impairment tests\n\nThe Committee discussed the annual impairment test performed in Q2 (trigger based) and in Q4 (annual test), specifically looking at the COVID-19 impact scenarios and future projections. The tests showed no impairment.\n\n## \u00b7 ESEF\n\nThe new European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) reporting requirements were discussed. Mid-January, the Dutch government announced that the Netherlands makes use of the possibility to extend the introduction of these rules by one year. Given that Signify was already well advanced in the preparations of publishing and filing its annual report in compliance with the new rules and in xHTML format, the company decided to already comply on a voluntary basis as of this year's annual report. In addition, the PDF format of the annual report will be made available on the company's website.\n\n## \u00b7 Interaction with external auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the key audit matters identified for 2020 by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, which are for the 2020 financials: revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, acquisition of Cooper Lighting; and for the sustainability information: reporting criteria sustainable revenues, and estimates and assumptions concerning the calculated impact of avoided CO 2 as presented in the value creation model. These topics are addressed in more detail either in this Supervisory Board Report or in other parts of the Annual Report to which they relate.\n\nRegarding the company's external auditors, the discussions also covered matters related to accounting policies, financial risks, and compliance with accounting standards, as well as compliance with (financial) legal requirements and relevant legal proceedings and related provisions. Other areas of Audit Committee review included the proposed external audit scope, approach, fees and the independence of the external auditor. The committee also reviewed the professional fitness and good standing of the external auditor and its engagement partners. For information on the fees of Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, refer to note B, Audit fees, to the Company financial statements.\n\n## 8.3.2\n\n## Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee assists the Supervisory Board by preparing the selection criteria and appointment procedure for members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, periodically assessing the succession planning for the individual members of these boards and the interviews of potential candidates. The Committee also supervises the policy on the selection and appointment of certain other key management positions. The Committee is charged with reviewing the company's corporate governance (for more information on corporate governance refer to chapter 10, Corporate governance, of this Annual Report). The performance evaluation of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is led by the Committee.\n\nIn 2020, Arthur van der Poel (Chair), Eelco Blok, Rita Lane and Frank Lubnau were members of this committee. As of January 2021, Eelco Blok stopped being a member of this Committee when he joined the Supervisory Board's Digital Committee.\n\nThe Committee met seven times in 2020 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The CEO and Chief Legal Officer generally attend the Committee's meetings. The Committee Chair has regular contact with the CEO and the Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary. Various topics are often prepared among the Committee members ahead of a",

Pamela Knapp brings knowledge and experience in general management and in particular in financial and economic aspects of international business, and was therefore well positioned to succeed Jill Lee as Audit Committee Chair, after Jill stepped down from the Supervisory Board as per end July 2020. The Supervisory Board recommended Frank Lubnau particularly in view of his extensive experience and knowledge in the digital domain. The 2020 AGM appointed Pamela Knapp and Frank Lubnau, and also re-appointed Arthur van der Poel and Rita Lane, each for a period of four years.\n\nThe above appointments and reappointments to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board were\n\nThe Supervisory Board is pleased with the continuity and strong performance that CEO Eric Rondolat brings, and with the strengthening of the team by Javier van Engelen as new CFO and Maria Letizia Mariani coming from within the company. Ren\u00e9 van Schooten handed over the CFO role to Javier in October, relinquished his position on the Board of Management as of January 1, 2021 and will stay as an advisor to the board until the end of May 2021. The Supervisory Board considers the Board of Management to operate as a strong team, and is very positive about how the team managed the COVID-19 crisis, which was evidenced by the company's performance over 2020.\n\nthe result of an assessment and selection process prepared and led by the Committee. In doing so, the Committee takes account of the desired board profile, including its diversity policy and expertise and experience as well as the desired board size. For the reappointments, the respective performance and board evaluations are also taken into consideration. As Arthur van der Poel and Rita Lane are both members of this Committee, neither took part in the decision-making process on the proposals of their respective re-appointments.\n\n- \u00b7 Board size and profile, including diversity We believe that it is of strategic importance that our Board of Management and Supervisory Board are composed in line with Dutch and international corporate governance best practices and that they have the expertise needed for a good understanding of current affairs and longer-term risks and opportunities related to the company's business, taking into account our objectives that promote diversity at board level. The Committee reviewed and made a proposal to the Supervisory Board for updating the boards' profile as well as the Supervisory Board skills and expertise matrix to reflect the areas that the Committee and Supervisory Board regard to be most relevant for Signify to address today's needs and those anticipated for the future.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board was also addressed in the annual",

Following an evaluation of the questionnaire by the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, observations were discussed in a plenary session with the Supervisory Board only. Hereafter, one-on-one discussions take place between the Chair and the individual Supervisory Board members, and with the Vice Chair on the functioning of the Chair. The responses to the questionnaire were shared with all respondents together with a proposal for follow-ups.\n\nThe self-evaluation has once again provided valuable insights on how the Supervisory Board operates as a team and where the Supervisory Board and the company can improve. In 2020, the Supervisory Board experienced a well operating board. The Supervisory Board meetings were found to be interesting, well prepared, in good spirit and with frank and open discussions, in which everybody played his or her own role. The evaluation brought practical insights, for example on how to discuss topics in an even more meaningful and efficient manner. In addition, the evaluation identified topics for further discussions, such as growth strategies of the company and digitalization, and showed general support to have culture become a fixed annual topic on the agenda of the Supervisory Board.\n\nBoard of Management and the review of the performance thereof.\n\nIn 2020, Gerard van de Aast (Chair), Arthur van der Poel and Rita Lane were members of this Committee.

Currently, no member of the Remuneration Committee is a member of the management board of another listed company.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee met four times in 2020 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The committee also consulted with the CEO, the Board of Management and certain other key management employees. Following those consultations, the Committee prepared decisions and advised the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs part of the standing agenda, the Remuneration Committee discussed, among other matters, the interim and final performance results on variable remuneration components for the past periods, target setting for variable remuneration for the upcoming periods, base salary levels for the Board of Management as well as disclosure in the remuneration report.\n\nIn 2020, some changes were being proposed to the remuneration policy for the Board of Management. The remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board were proposed to and adopted by the 2020 AGM. The Committee discussed and analyzed the AGM advisory vote on the 2019 remuneration report. As part of the analysis, the Committee Chair engaged with stakeholders to obtain feedback on the remuneration report and views on executive pay, especially in these extraordinary times, and reported back the findings to the Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nPlease also refer to chapter 9, Remuneration Report, of this Annual Report, for further information on the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and how these was implemented in 2020.\n\n## 8.3.4 Digital Committee\n\nIn view of the importance of digitalization especially in the coming few years (see also above), the Supervisory Board established the Digital Committee as of January 1, 2021.\n\nThe Digital Committee assists the Supervisory Board by, amongst other matters, reviewing the company's digital strategy and roadmap, digital objectives and performance and the governance for deciding on digital prioritization. Frank Lubnau (Chair), Eelco Blok and Rita Lane are members of this committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.4\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nWe performed an evaluation of the performance of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2020. The Board of Management performed a self-evaluation of its functioning and the functioning of its individual members. The results of this evaluation were reported to the Chair and discussed in the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe objective of our Supervisory Board self-evaluation is to gain better insight into the functioning of the Supervisory Board, to identify strengths that we want to keep and to identify matters that the Supervisory Board or the company can improve. Last year, our self-evaluation was facilitated by an external party. Building on last year's observations together with relevant developments in 2020, we prepared a new questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed, among other matters, the focus of discussions during our meetings, strategic direction and discussions, culture, the functioning of the committees, the relationship between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, the views on the Supervisory Board as a team and how it conducted itself, learnings from the COVID-19 crisis as well as the desired focus in the future.",

This report includes a detailed explanation of the current remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The effectuation of these policies in 2020 is discussed in part 9.2 and 9.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nThis was a challenging year, and yet we are very proud of how the company performed. The company acted quickly as COVID-19 began to engulf the world, and employees focused well to deliver for our shareholders. The Remuneration Policy as put forth during the AGM in 2020 in alignment with the Shareholder Rights Directive II was supported by our shareholders. Over the course of 2020 we engaged with key stakeholders and the Dutch Works Council to understand their views on remuneration in general and to solicit feedback on the remuneration report of Signify. These interactions were very productive, leading to a good dialogue and provided valuable feedback for inclusion in our 2020 remuneration report.\n\n## Services agreements new Board of Management members\n\nWe welcomed to our Board of Management two new members in 2020. We are pleased that one board member, M.L. Mariani, came from within the company, which ilustrates our continued focus on being a strong talent-building company. At the same time, we were pleased to welcome a new Signify colleague, F.J. van Engelen Sousa, who adds to the broad range of skills and experience within the Board of Management. The remuneration of the two new board members was based on competitive benchmarks and the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management. As  F.J. van Engelen Sousa was hired externally he was provided with an attractive remuneration package which includes a sign-on award of shares in the form of restricted share units. This sign-on award is to address potential value that he may leave behind in his former role in either stock or cash. This award has a holding period of 5 years from grant date and includes a specific clawback clause primarily focused on him being employed for at least 3 years. Finally, as F.J. van Engelen Sousa and his family now live abroad, additional relocation arrangements in line with our relocation policy were provided to support him and his family's  transition to The Netherlands.\n\n## Signify's performance In 2020\n\nSignify had a very strong performance in 2020 given the volatility of the year. Our industry was severely impacted by the pandemic as is reflected in the decline in the comparable sales growth results.  However, profitability and free cash flow as a percentage of sales were improved against this backdrop of a decline in demand. Relative to the targets set at the\n\n## 9  Remuneration report",

We experienced those conversations as very constructive and they have led to improvements in our Remuneration Report. While our LTI reporting was identified by stakeholders as being very comprehensive, our reporting on the annual incentive plan was identified as an area for improvement. We are pleased to have introduced changes to the 2020 report in direct response to this feedback. We trust that stakeholders will experience these changes positively and appreciate the spirit of transparency and continuous improvement which drives them.\n\n## Gerard van de Aast\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\nbeginning of 2020, the results on the key financial measures as well as the achievement against individual targets resulted in a below target outcome on the annual incentive for the Board of Management.\n\nSignify announced major milestones in our sustainability program: carbon neutrality was achieved in 2020 and 100% renewable electricity is now used.  In addition, Signify has over performed on most of its other commitments in the 2020 Brighter Lives, Better World program, inclusive of zero waste to landfill for our manufacturing sites.  This positive financial and non-financial performance in free cash flow, relative total shareholder return and sustainability is reflected in the over achievement of the conditions for vest of the 2018 long-term incentive plan.  Maintaining this ambitious drive beyond carbon neutrality, the company announced the Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program which aims to double the positive impact on the environment and society and will drive future targets in the long-term incentive plan of Signify.\n\n## Company measures COVID-19 in 2020\n\nThe company acted quickly and anticipated the potential impact of the coronavirus on the health of employees and the potential impact to the business.\n\nAction was immediately taken to reduce the fixed cost base. A key Signify value is Greater Together, and it was in this spirit that a number of temporary measures that impacted all Signify stakeholders were taken:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Management and Leadership Team took a 20% salary reduction in Q2 2020.\n- \u00b7 The Supervisory Board members took a 20% reduction on Q2 2020 fees.\n- \u00b7 All employees were asked to voluntarily support a 20% work time reduction with a pro-rata pay adjustment in Q2 2020.\n- \u00b7 An external hiring freeze was implemented to maximize the internal opportunities of our employees.\n- \u00b7 Dividends were suspended for our shareholders in 2020.\n\nUltimately as announced in January 2021, Signify was able to return contributions to employees who voluntarily participated in the 20% work time reduction. However, this did not apply to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board members for whom no returns were made. Additionally, an extraordinary dividend of EUR 1.35 per share is proposed. The ability to provide a return to employees and propose an extraordinary dividend  is a testament to the excellent stewardship of the company by the Board of Management and the Leadership Team over the course of a very volatile 2020.",

Our policy aims to stimulate sustainable short- and long-term value creation. Therefore, the performance measures used in the variable compensation components are linked to quantitative financial, non-financial and sustainability targets. The remuneration policy also serves a communication purpose as it clearly stipulates and supports a common approach to deliver on the company's strategy.\n\n## Signify's value creation model:\n\nThe value created by Signify goes beyond financial performance alone. Our approach is to optimize value through financial, environmental and social resources.  Our focus on environment and societal implications of doing business is evidenced in our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program. This program links to our long-term Incentive plan and ensures that the interests of the organization, society at large and our impact on the environment in which we live are key elements In how Signify delivers long-term value creation to shareholders.  Our activities and our way of doing business impact customers, employees, investors and society at large. Signify expresses these impacts in monetary terms in chapter 3.3 Value creation model, of this Annual Report.\n\nThe current remuneration policy for the Board of Management and for the Supervisory Board was adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) in 2020 with respectively 94.10% and 98.78%. The effectuation of these policies in 2020 is discussed in part 9.2 and 9.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nThe report included in this chapter constitutes the remuneration report within the meaning of Section 2:135b of the Dutch Civil Code.",

Furthermore, estimated future remuneration levels are assessed against the potential achievement of strategic objectives. Based on the scenario analyses performed, the Supervisory Board has concluded that the policy supports the pay-for-performance philosophy.\n\n## 9.2.1 Mix of remuneration elements\n\nTo support the remuneration objectives, the policy includes significant variable components in the form of an annual (cash) incentive and a long-term equity based incentive of performance shares. As a result, a significant proportion of pay is 'at risk' through variable incentives. The chart below shows the  relative on-target value of fixed versus variable compensation with 58% - 64% of compensation being variable in nature.\n\n## 9.2.2 Base salary\n\nThe base salary compensates for the individual's experience, skills, duties, responsibilities and the contribution of the individual within Signify. The Supervisory Board determines the base salary and may adjust the base salary for example following the results of benchmark studies and to ensure alignment between members of the Board of Management. Absent any adjustment of the base salary, it follows the (collective and merit) increase as agreed for the CLA population in the Netherlands.

These measures were determined by the Supervisory Board to reflect the best alignment with the company's strategy and financial objectives for the mid-term focusing on profitable growth. The financial targets for 2020 were set within the context of the medium-term objectives of the company at the beginning of the year and did not change over the course of 2020. Pay-out between the financial targets is linear.\n\nThe team/individual performance measures are recommended by the CEO and discussed and ultimately approved by the Supervisory Board. For 2020 these measures included employee and customer net promoter scores, operational efficiency, sales growth for new growth engines and progress on the integrations of the acquired companies Cooper Lighting and Klite. Over the course of 2020, mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 virus on the business and the safety of employees became a key team goal for the Board of Management.\n\n## Performance achievements 2020\n\nPerformance against financial targets are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The assessment of performance under the annual incentive plan is concluded by the Supervisory Board. No changes were made to the original targets set for the year 2020 because of COVID-19.\n\nFor 2020, Comparable Sales Growth was below the threshold of performance resulting in an achievement of 0%. Adjusted EBITA was slightly above the threshold level of performance that was set at the beginning of 2020 and as such results in an achievement of 57.1%. The company outperformed on Free Cash Flow with a result at the maximum level of performance and therefore achievement on this measure is at the maximum of 200%.  The Supervisory Board did not apply any discretion to the outcomes of the financial measures.\n\nFinally, the Supervisory Board assessed the achievement of the Board of Management relative to each of their individual goals and their collective team goals. The Supervisory Board was very pleased with the progress and realized synergies of the integrations of Cooper Lighting and Klite. Our acquisition of Cooper Lighting strengthened our position in the attractive North American lighting market. Together with the fast integration of Klite, the synergies created are providing real value and the transfer of business is ahead of plan. In addition, the cash and profit targets have been achieved for Cooper Lighting while the Klite revenue impact is also ahead of target. Good outcomes in the drive to increase operational\n\n## 9.2.3 Variable remuneration\n\nThe variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management consists of an annual cash incentive and a long-term equity-based incentive.\n\nThe design of the incentives aims to achieve a balance between short-term objectives and long-term value creation and sustainable performance. Variable pay is based on both financial and non-financial performance measures. In selecting performance measures, their respective weights and targets for a performance period, the following is considered:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance measures are selected based on relevance to the company's strategy.\n- \u00b7 The company's strategy determines the targets and intervals for the performance measures.\n- \u00b7 Targets are set ambitiously yet realistically, taking the company's risk appetite into account.\n- \u00b7 Alignment with stakeholders' interests and expectations is essential.\n\nThe Supervisory Board determines the target for each of the performance measures of the annual cash incentive and the long-term equity-based incentive. The target definition for these variable remuneration components includes target intervals and correlating pay-out schemes, being defined in incremental steps in performance and respective pay-out. In addition, a minimum threshold for the achievement of financial performance measures applies, below which there will be no pay-out. Following the end of the relevant performance period, the Supervisory Board will assess the actual performance relative to the targets set. On that basis, the Supervisory Board will, at its discretion, determine the achievement per performance measure and target.\n\n## 9.2.4 Annual cash incentive\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are eligible for an annual cash incentive. The annual incentive is designed to reward the achievement of annual financial and operational objectives and personal performance. The purpose is to ensure alignment with the company's annual business plan setting the strategic priorities for that year, which in turn contribute to the company's long-term objectives.\n\nThe Supervisory Board can annually select two or three financial performance measures from the following list, and determine the weighting per performance measure: growth (such as comparable sales growth), profit (such as adjusted EBITA or net income), cash flow (such as average working capital or free cash flow) and investment return (such as return on capital employed).",

Mariani.\n\n## 9.2.5 Long-term equity-based incentive\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are eligible for a long-term equity-based incentive under the Signify Long-term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan). The objective of the long-term incentive is to link pay with long-term sustainable value creation. In addition to the Board of Management, another approximately 600 employees globally are eligible for participation in a similar long-term incentive plan.\n\nThe main characteristics of the long-term incentive plan for the Board of Management are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The long-term incentive is granted in performance shares only and granted annually.\n- \u00b7 The vesting of performance shares is conditional upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of three financial years and continued Signify employment.\n- \u00b7 Performance is measured using four performance measures in 2020: relative total shareholder return (25%), free cash flow (25%), return on capital employed (25%) and sustainability (25%).\n- \u00b7 Pay-out per performance measure can vary between 0% and 200%.\n\nefficiencies were realized in the form of above target procurement savings, supply chain warehousing and distribution costs, and manufacturing base cost improvements.  From a customer first perspective which is core to the business strategy, the Supervisory Board has been pleased with the continued progress in the customer net promoter score from 34 in 2018 to 41 in 2020, despite the challenges this year. From a great place to work perspective, there was a significant change to the operating model to verticalize our operations capabilities and organize more around our customer segments that was extremely well executed and provided immediate tangible results. The employee net promoter score is at an all-time high of 29 at the end of 2020, representing a significant increase from a net promoter score of 20 at the end of 2019.\n\nFinally, and critically for all stakeholders of Signify, the management of the COVID-19 impact on the business was pro-actively managed by the Board of Management. Decisive action was taken to mitigate the impact while ensuring the safety and well-being of employees. While overall sales growth slowed in response to the pandemic, the Board of Management capitalized on the new opportunities that presented themselves as evidenced in the traction of the UVC lighting portfolio. While our industry was severely impacted by the pandemic, the Board of Management was able to improve our profitability and free cash flow as a percentage of sales, even against the backdrop of a decline in demand.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed the team and individual objectives and achievements as described above and assessed performance for 2020 as excellent. As a result, the Supervisory Board has determined that the realized performance on this measure was 150%. For F.J. van Engelen Sousa the Supervisory Board allocated a realized performance on this measure of 100% for his positive impact in a shorter time frame on the outcomes as described above.\n\nThe summarized outcomes realized on all measures are as follows:\n\n| Performance measures                         | Weighting   | Realized    | Realized %   | Multiple  achieved   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| Comparable sales growth                      | 30%         | ( 1 2.7 ) % | 0%           | 0%                   |\n| Adjusted EBITA                               | 30%         | 10.5%       | 57.1%        | 17.1%                |\n| Free Cash Flow                               | 20%         | 12.1%       | 200%         | 40%                  |\n| Team and individual performance  measures  1 | 20%         | 150%        | 150%         | 30%                  |\n| Multiple achieved                            |             |             |              | 87.1%                |\n\n- 1 The 100% realization on team and individual performances measures for F.J. van Engelen Sousa results in multiple achieved of 77.1%.",

Relative total shareholder return (TSR) measures the share price growth plus dividends paid over the three-year performance period. Performance is expressed as a percentage. This percentage is compared to the TSR performance of companies included in the peer group specifically compiled for this purpose. The TSR performance is determined for each company in the peer group and the performances are ranked from top to bottom. Signify's position in the ranking, together with the pay-out curve, determines the pay-out level.

long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a free cash flow target over the three-year performance period. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe vesting of 25% (20% for 2018 and 2019 grants) of the annual long-term incentive grant is dependent on how well Signify performs against the targets set with respect to the sustainability condition. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan. As targets set are usually both qualitative as well as quantitative, set ambitiously and adjusted regularly, the assessment of the performance is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board. The discretionary decision will use tracked performance as input.\n\n## Return on Capital Employed\n\nThe vesting of the remaining 25% (not applicable for 2018 and 2019 grant) of the annual long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a return on capital employed target over the three-year performance period. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\nIn 2020, performance shares were granted to the members of the Board of Management. These grants are governed by the Signify long-term incentive plan. The grant is made on the basis of the three months average closing share price preceding the date of grant. In this way, the Signify granting policy ensures mitigation of share price volatility.",

These guidelines are designed to further align the interest of the members of the Board of Management (and certain other leaders within Signify) with the interests of its shareholders. For the CEO, the value in Signify shares to be held is 300% of base salary and for the other members of the Board of Management it is 200% of base salary. The guidelines require that all after-tax shares be retained until the required level is met.\n\nIn addition, members of the Board of Management shall comply with holding requirements under the Dutch corporate governance code. This effectively means that members of the Board of Management shall hold all after-tax shares received under the long-term incentive plan for a period of at least five years from the date of grant.",

        "page_content": "SIGNIFY AR2020 -5e proef - 18/2/2021\n\nIn light of transparency and clarity, Signify applies a methodology to calculate the internal pay ratio that is IFRS-driven (i.e. linked to Signify's notes to the Consolidated financial statements).\n\nThe CEO pay ratio has increased from 2019 to 2020.  As detailed in section 9.2.10 of this report, this is a result of the proportional shift in geographic spread of Signify employees from Western Europe to lower cost locations. The addition of Cooper Lighting and Klite employees in 2020 resulted in an increase in our employee representation in Latin America, India and China. As a result, average employee pay has declined from 2019 to 2020 reflective of this proportionally higher employee representation in lower cost locations. Signify believes that the pay ratio over the past years aligns with Signify's profile, considering the company's industry, workforce profile and geographic spread.\n\n## 9.2.12 Claw back and change of control\n\nThe annual cash incentive and the long-term incentive of the members of the Board of Management are subject to adjustment and claw back provisions. Pursuant hereto, the company can (a) revise an incentive prior to payment if unaltered payment would be unreasonable and unfair, (b) recover an incentive if it was granted on the basis of incorrect information on the fulfillment of the incentive goals or the conditions for payment of the incentive, and (c) recoup incentives in the circumstances set forth in the services contract with the member of the Board of Management concerned.\n\nIn the event of a change of control of the company, the Supervisory Board can, at its sole discretion, decide to accelerate the vesting of any unvested awards under the long-term incentive, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions up to the date of the completion of the change of control.\n\nNo variable remuneration has been clawed-back In 2020.\n\n## 9.2.13 Additional arrangements\n\nUnless relevant law provides otherwise, the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board shall be reimbursed by the company for various costs and expenses, such as reasonable costs of defending claims, as formalized in the Articles of Association. Under certain circumstances, described in the Articles of Association, such as an action or failure to act by a member of the Board of Management or a member of the Supervisory Board that can be characterized as intentional ('opzettelijk'), intentionally reckless ('bewust roekeloos') or seriously culpable ('ernstig verwijtbaar'), there will be no entitlement to this\n\nwhich influences ongoing grants. This is in line with the development of the free cash flow and share price, which increased by 54% and 24% respectively. The total remuneration of the Board of Management includes the 20% reduction in base salary in Q2 for which the Board of Management volunteered and a decline in the pension transition allowance as detailed in 9.2.9.\n\nThe trend in employee pay reflects the change in employee geographic spread. Since 2018, a greater proportion of our employee population has shifted from Western Europe to South East Asia, Asia, and Latin America. The acquisitions of Cooper Lighting and Klite resulted in an increase in our employee population from 2019 to 2020 and the majority of that increase is in Latin America, India and China. In addition, Signify has been increasing the employee population in India due to growth in R&D software and IT. As a result, average employee pay has been trending down reflective of this significant shift to our employee geographic spread.\n\n## 9.2.11 Signify's internal pay ratio\n\nThe remuneration design for the members of the Board of Management is an integral part of the overall pay structure within the company. Signify uses the Hay system for evaluating and grading the various positions within its organization. This means that the company uses a standardized method for determining the appropriate benefits for each of the respective job levels within the company. Using the Hay grading system also ensures that the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is aligned with and is relative to the remuneration of Signify employees holding other positions within the company. The remuneration of senior staff within Signify is based on the same components as the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Code requires reporting on pay ratio. Signify's pay ratio reflects the average total compensation of the total global employee workforce, relative to the total remuneration package of the CEO. This has resulted in the following outcome:\n\n|   Fiscal year | CEO total   remuneration  1   | Average total   compensation employees  2   |   Resulting pay ratio |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n|          2020 | 3,245,335                     | 51,780                                      |                    63 |\n|          2019 | 2,822,104                     | 60,601                                      |                    47 |\n|          2018 | 2,564,306                     | 61,264                                      |                    42 |\n|          2017 | 3,048,621                     | 64,550                                      |                    47 |",

The Divisions are responsible for the development of their strategy, product portfolio and the production and sourcing of their products.\n\nIn addition, the company's commercial organization is currently structured along four geographical Market Groups to manage its global sales channels. The Market Groups are principally responsible for driving and managing sales, managing customer relationships and delivering the commercial activities of the business across the company's markets, covering commercial activities in almost all countries.\n\nThe company operates in many countries via its subsidiaries and affiliated companies as well as via a limited number of branch\n\n## 10 Corporate governance\n\n## Introduction\n\nSignify N.V., a public company with limited liability organized under Dutch law, is the parent company of the Signify group.\n\nIn May 2016, Koninklijke Philips N.V. offered part of its shares in the share capital of Signify N.V. to the public and the shares in the capital of Signify N.V. were listed on Euronext Amsterdam. Koninklijke Philips N.V. further decreased its stake via several sell downs in the years thereafter and in September 2019, it sold its remaining shares in the capital of Signify N.V. As a result of this sale by Koninklijke Philips N.V., the relationship agreement between Signify N.V. and Koninklijke Philips N.V. entered into in the context of the IPO, which contains certain governance arrangements, was terminated.\n\nSignify N.V. has a two-tier board structure consisting of a Board of Management and a Supervisory Board. The two boards are independent of each other and are accountable to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) for the performance of their duties.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for maintaining an appropriate corporate governance structure of the company.\n\nSignify N.V.'s corporate governance framework is based on the company's Articles of Association, the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act and any other applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, the Board of Management has implemented a code of conduct, policies, directives and authorization schedules throughout Signify in order to strengthen its governance framework.",

Signify believes that this will positively impact the company's business performance in all countries in which the company does business.\n\nIn view of the above, Signify aims for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to be composed of members that bring a diversity of skills and expertise relevant for achieving the company's strategic and business objectives, different views and perspectives as well as different backgrounds (nationality, educational, working experience or otherwise), and that at least 30% are men and at least 30% are women. The latter is in line with Dutch legislation that was effective until December 31, 2019. In November 2020, the Dutch government published a proposal introducing a \"grow in quota\", which should result in supervisory boards of listed companies being composed of at least 1/3 men and at least 1/3 women. Signify's Supervisory Board meets this diversity objective.\n\nFor further information, please refer to chapter 8, Supervisory Board report, of this Annual Report.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nMembers of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board shall not participate in\n\noffices, which primarily act under the Signify trade name.\n\nDivisions and Market Groups are supported by centralized shared services with respect to, among other functions, legal, finance, human resources, business transformation, strategy, marketing, innovation and operations.\n\nSignify intends to remove its current Market Group structure and organize its markets in clusters. This is currently subject to works council proceedings.\n\n## 10.2  Board of Management\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. The Board of Management focuses on long-term value creation for the company and its business, and takes the relevant stakeholders' interests into account.\n\nAmong other responsibilities, the Board of Management drives the company's management agenda, defines and deploys the strategic direction, identifies opportunities and risks connected with its business activities and strategy, pursues the operational and financial objectives of the company and monitors corporate social responsibility issues relevant to the company.\n\nIn performing its duties, the Board of Management is guided by the interests of\n\nthe company and its affiliated enterprises, taking into consideration the interests of its stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of Management is accountable for its actions and decisions to the Supervisory Board and is answerable to shareholders of the company at the AGM.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Board of Management have regular contact with the Chair and other members of the Supervisory Board, attend most parts of the Supervisory Board meetings, and provide the Supervisory Board with all the information it needs to fulfil its own responsibilities.\n\nCertain decisions of the Board of Management require Supervisory Board approval, including important proposals for capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestments, decisions concerning financial and operational objectives and strategy to achieve such objectives, changes to corporate policies, as well as the annual operating plan.\n\nThe functioning and decision-making within the Board of Management are laid down in its Rules of Procedure which can be found on the company's website.\n\n## Appointment and composition\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (the General Meeting) upon a nomination drawn up by the Supervisory Board, which nomination may be binding.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed for a maximum term of four years, it being understood that this term expires at the end of the AGM to be held in the fourth year after the year of their appointment. Re-appointment is possible for consecutive terms of four years or, if applicable, until a later retirement date or other termination date in the fourth year, unless the General Meeting resolves otherwise. Members may be suspended by the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting, and dismissed by the l a t t e r.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management follows the profile which aims for an appropriate combination of knowledge and experience among its members, encompassing industrial, technology & innovation, projects & infrastructure, digital & marketing, financial, economic, IT, social & sustainability aspects of international business and society, in relation to the global character of its business. The size of the Board of Management may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board based on the remuneration policy adopted by the General Meeting. The composition of the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the remuneration policy are described in chapter 9, Remuneration report, of this Annual Report.",

Each member of the Supervisory Board meets the independence requirements as stated in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Supervisory Board Committees\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board had three committees: The Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee and the Remuneration Committee.

The Supervisory Board is required to be notified of other important positions (to be) held by a member of the Board of Management.\n\nDutch law provides for limitations on the overall number of supervisory positions that a member of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board (including a one-tier board) of large Dutch companies may hold.

Also, a person cannot be appointed as a supervisory director or non-executive director of a large Dutch company if he or\n\nshe already holds a supervisory position at five or more other large Dutch companies, whereby the position of chair of the supervisory board or one-tier board of another large Dutch company is counted twice.\n\n## 10.3  Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board, in the two-tier board structure under Dutch law, is a separate body that is independent of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board supervises the policies and management and the general affairs of the company. The Supervisory Board also provides advice to the Board of Management.

The composition of the Supervisory Board follows the profile which aims for an appropriate combination of knowledge and experience among its members, encompassing industrial, technology & innovation, projects & infrastructure, digital & marketing, financial, economic, IT, social & sustainability aspects of international business and society, in relation to the global character of its business. The size of the Supervisory Board may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile. The composition of the Supervisory Board shall be in accordance with the best practice provisions on independence of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code as well as Dutch law restrictions on the overall number of supervisory positions that a member of the Supervisory Board may hold. Each member shall be capable of assessing the broad outline of the overall management of the company.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets at least six times a year.

To this end, the foundation Stichting Continu\u00efteit Signify has been granted a call option by the company to acquire preference shares. The foundation may resolve to exercise the call option at its sole discretion and does not require the consent of the company to exercise the call option. On the exercise of the call option, the foundation is entitled to acquire, and the company shall have the unconditional obligation to issue, preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company.

Holders of ordinary shares in the aggregate representing at least 3% of the total issued share capital may submit proposals for the AGM agenda. Such proposals must be made in writing at least 60 days before the AGM to the Board of Management. Any written request must comply with the procedure stipulated by the Board of Management, which is published on the company's website.\n\nEach ordinary share confers the right to cast one vote in the General Meeting. There are no special statutory rights attached to the shares of the company and no restrictions on the voting rights of the company's shares exist. Subject to certain exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast. A resolution to amend the Articles of Association requires a simple majority of the votes cast, if the resolution is adopted on a proposal of the Board of Management. Otherwise, such resolution requires a majority of at least three-fourths of the votes cast provided that majority represents more than half of the issued share capital. Pursuant to Dutch law, no votes may be cast at a General Meeting in\n\nrespect of shares which are held by the company.\n\n## Share capital and repurchase and issue of (rights to) shares\n\nThe authorized share capital of the company amounts to EUR 6 million, divided into 300 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of one eurocent each and 300 million preference shares, also with a nominal value of one eurocent each.

No preference shares had been issued as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the foundation has the right to file a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to commence an inquiry procedure within the meaning of section 2:344 Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe foundation's objects are to further the interests of Signify N.V., the enterprises maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group. The foundation will act in such a way that the interests of the company and of those enterprises are optimally safeguarded and that influences which could affect the independence, continuity or identity of the company, the enterprise maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group in conflict with those interests are deterred to the best of the foundation's ability.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 the board of the foundation was composed as follows: Jos Streppel (chair), Sietze Hepkema and Jan Willem Baud.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that also in the event of (an attempt at) a hostile takeover or other attempt to obtain (de facto) control of the company, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are authorized to exercise in the interests of Signify all powers vested in them.\n\nThe company is not a party to any material agreement that takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of control of the company following a take-over bid as referred to in section 5:70 of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act, other than the credit agreement entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions which established term loans and a revolving credit facility, the Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020 and the Trade Mark License Agreement entered into with Koninklijke Philips N.V. The credit agreement includes a change of control provision which allows the lenders to cancel the commitment and declare any outstanding amounts under the agreement, immediately due and payable whereupon such amounts will become immediately due and payable. The provisions applicable to all Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020 contain a 'Change of Control Put Event'. This means that if the company experienced such an event with respect to such bonds, the company might be required to redeem or purchase the bonds at its principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\n\n## 10.5  External auditor\n\nUnder Dutch law, the external auditor of the company is appointed by the General Meeting. In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code  and Regulation (EU) 537/2014, the Supervisory Board selects and nominates an external auditor for appointment, upon advice by the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee assess the functioning of the external auditor, taking the observations from the Board of Management into account. The General Meeting re-appointed Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as external auditor of the company for the financial years 2020 through 2022.\n\nThe external auditor attends, in principle, all meetings of the Audit Committee.

The external auditor attends the meeting of the Supervisory Board at which the report of the external auditor with respect to the audit of the annual accounts is discussed, and at which the annual accounts are approved.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nThe Audit Committee evaluates at least annually the external auditor's independence.

The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and timing thereof depend on several factors, including future sales, profits, financial conditions, general economic and business conditions and prospects. Other factors that the Board of Management may deem relevant, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements, may also impact the amount, timing and payment of future dividends. These may be beyond the control of the company.\n\n## Proposed dividend\n\nThe company proposes a dividend of EUR 1.40 per share, in cash, from the net income for full-year 2020, in line with its dividend policy of paying an increasing dividend per share every year. This is in addition to the extraordinary dividend of EUR 1.35 per share to its shareholders, as proposed on January 13, 2021.\n\nThe dividend payment is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.

These repurchases took place in February, July and August 2020.\n\n## 11.5 Debt info\n\nIn January 2020, Signify entered into new committed financing facilities to replace its term loans of EUR 740 million and USD 500 million and its revolving credit facility of EUR 500 million with similar terms, which were due to expire in May 2021.\n\nThe committed term loan structure consisted of EUR 400 million and USD 275 million with a maturity of three years (January 2023) and EUR 340 million and USD 225 million with a maturity of five years (January 2025). The committed EUR 500 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (RCF) has a maturity of five years (January 2025), with the option to extend it twice by one year at the end of the first and second anniversary. In January 2021 the RCF\n\nwas extended by one year until 2026. The option remains to extend the RCF by another year.\n\nAs of September 2020, following the repayment of EUR 350 million of debt, the committed term loan structure consists of EUR 50 million and USD 275 million maturing in January 2023 and EUR 340 million and USD 225 million maturing in January 2025.\n\nThe term loans and RCF agreement include a financial covenant providing that Signify maintains a net leverage ratio of no greater than 3.5x. The net leverage ratio may temporarily increase to 4.0x within 12 months of the closing of the Cooper Lighting acquisition or other material acquisitions. The covenant does not apply if the company has at least one investment grade rating. Signify has investment grade ratings with two rating agencies.\n\nIn May 2020, Signify issued its inaugural EUR 1.275 billion Eurobond Offering comprising of EUR 675 million fixed rate notes due 2024 with a coupon of 2.000% and EUR 600 million fixed rate notes due 2027 with a coupon of 2.375%.

The objectives of the BCF are to maintain integrated management control of the company's operations, in order to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and related disclosure, as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The company has designed its BCF based on the frameworks established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The company regularly  evaluates and improves its BCF to align with business dynamics and good practice.\n\n## Integrity code\n\nActing with integrity is the cornerstone for the success of our business and key to achieving our purpose. It is integral to the values that define us as a company. Acting with integrity means making the right choices when faced with ethical dilemmas and holding ourselves and each other to high standards of behavior.\n\nThe Integrity code has been adopted by the Board of Management. It applies to all employees of Signify N.V. and its controlled subsidiaries. The Integrity code formulates minimum standards of behavior.\n\nThe company has underlying policies that form an integral part of the Integrity code.\n\n## 12 Risk factors and risk management\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt Signify, we believe taking risks is an inherent part of entrepreneurial behavior. By deploying a structured risk management process, it allows management to take risks in a controlled manner. The company's risk management and controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that strategic and financial business objectives are met by integrating management control into the daily operations, by ensuring compliance with legal requirements and by safeguarding the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures. The components of our risk management process are listed below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.1\n\n## Establish strong risk management environment\n\nSignify's risk management environment is embedded in the corporate governance, the business control framework and the Integrity code.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nCorporate governance is the system by which a company is directed and controlled. Good corporate governance derives from, among other things, solid internal controls and high ethical standards.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for the risk management associated with the company's activities and defining the company's risk appetite. It is assisted by the company leadership team, which participate on a quarterly basis in audit risk and control meetings to identify critical risks and review progress on the implementation of risk responses. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board provides oversight for the system of internal business controls and risk management. Internal audits, external audits or management self-assessment are reported to and discussed quarterly by the Audit Committee. An in-depth description of the company corporate governance structure can be found in chapter 10, Corporate governance, of this Annual Report.",

Owners are assigned and accountable for ensuring adequate risk mitigation and monitoring measures are implemented. The outcome of the risk workshop is integrated in the strategic planning cycle. Each quarter the key risks are discussed during the audit and risk committee meetings. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated at Division, Market Group and company level.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nRisks are reported on a regular basis as part of the business performance reviews or, for specific topics, through dedicated risk committees. In addition, on an annual basis the top risks are identified by company leadership. Relevant risks including those associated with business opportunities are prioritized in terms of potential impact and\n\nTo increase the level of awareness and to create global engagement, the company has established a network of Compliance Officers in countries where the company has a presence, on each significant site, and at Division, Market Group and Functional level. The activities and responsibilities of this network are focused on providing expertise and support on Integrity coderelated matters to managers and employees.\n\nThe Integrity code is supported by mechanisms that ensure standardized reporting, escalation and investigation of concerns. These mechanisms are based on the Integrity code Reporting Policy that urges employees and third parties to report any concerns they may have regarding business conduct in relation to the Integrity code, either through a Compliance Officer or through the Signify Ethics line. The Signify Ethics line enables employees and third parties to report a concern either by telephone or online via a web intake form. All concerns raised are registered consistently in a single database and are investigated in accordance with standardized investigation procedures. An overview of the reporting activities for 2020 are given in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, of this Annual Report.\n\n## 12.2  Define Risk appetite\n\nRisk management in Signify focuses on the following risk categories: Strategic, Operational, Compliance and Financial risks. The board of management has determined the risk appetite and seeks to manage risk within these boundaries. The risk appetite is different for each of the risk categories:\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risks include economic and political developments and the effects of actions taken to anticipate and respond to market circumstances. The company has medium risk appetite and is prepared to take some reasonable strategic risks, balancing the need to capture return from opportunities and manage risks.\n\nThe company's key strategic risks are discussed in 12.5 and include 'Technological change', 'Competition', 'Global political and economic instability - COVID-19', 'Digitalization', 'Acquisitions and integration'.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nOperational risks include adverse unexpected developments resulting from internal processes, people and systems, or from external events that are linked to the running of each business. The company has low risk appetite and aims to minimize downside risks to maintain the high quality of its products, systems and services, reliable IT systems and sustainability commitments.\n\nThe company's key operational risks are discussed in 12.5 and include 'Re-allocation of resources', 'Supply disruptions', 'Innovation', 'Cyber-attacks and security breaches', New organizational capabilities', 'Climate change'.\n\n## Compliance risks\n\nThese risks cover unanticipated failures to implement, or comply with, appropriate laws, regulations, policies and procedures. The company is, due to the global footprint, exposed to risk of fraud and other misconduct in violation of the integrity code and/or applicable laws and regulations and governmental investigation and legal proceedings in relation thereto. The company has very low risk appetite and is committed to full compliance to relevant laws, regulations and its Integrity code.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company faces financial risks outside its control related to treasury, accounting and reporting, pensions, and tax. Here, the risk appetite is low.  Therefore, the company aims to minimize the impact, and it follows a conservative risk management approach in these areas. Furthermore, the company is committed to transparent and truthful accounting and reporting to allow users of the financial statements to take decisions considering these risks.",

Integration into the risk management framework is important, especially so for large acquisitions such as Cooper Lighting. For Cooper Lighting, the following actions were taken:\n\n- \u00b7 The integrity code was deployed.\n- \u00b7 Cooper Lighting employees have been included in the Signify compliance training schedule.\n- \u00b7 A multi-year plan to integrate Cooper Lighting into the internal control framework was made.\n- \u00b7 Self-assessment was deployed for key controls.\n- \u00b7 Cooper Lighting entities have been included in the certification process.\n\nlikelihood, considering quantitative and/or qualitative aspects and reviewed with the board of management. On a quarterly basis, risks and controls are reviewed in the audit risk committees with the Divisions, Market Groups and specific Functions.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nThe Integrity Committee is the ultimate body within Signify to administer the organization's Integrity Code Legal Compliance Program. It does so by maintaining oversight of the development and implementation of the Integrity code, including the monitoring of its effectiveness. The integrity Committee is chaired by the Chief Legal Officer. Its members include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief HR Officer, Head of Internal Audit and the Head of Legal Compliance.\n\nWith an annual Integrity code selfassessment process forming part of ICS, compliance to the Integrity code forms part of management's ICS monitoring process. Management of each business unit signs off on controls relating to compliance with the Integrity code, with this confirmation forming part of the annual certification statement on Business Controls. Noncompliance issues are highlighted and, if significant, they are reported to the Board of Management through the Certification Statement process.\n\nEmployees are requested to state their commitment to the Integrity code after having completed the e-learnings. In 2020, employees were required to complete one or more e-learnings on the Integrity code\n\nand related legal compliance domains. Specific target groups were required to participate in recurring face-to-face trainings. In addition, each year Finance and Procurement employees are asked to sign off on the Financial and the Procurement Codes of Ethics respectively. All executives are asked to sign off on the Integrity code each year to confirm their awareness of and compliance with the code. Violations of the Integrity code will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company has implemented a global standard for internal controls over financial reporting (ICS). ICS, together with the established accounting procedures, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect transactions necessary to permit preparation of financial statements, that policies and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel and that published financial statements are properly prepared and do not contain any material misstatements.\n\nInternal controls are an inherent part of the processes in our company, where the responsibility for executing these internal controls is with the persons that carry out these processes. The design and maintenance of the global standard for internal controls is with the (global) business process owners and the dedicated ICS team.\n\nAn ICS monitoring process exists for all material reporting units, where business process owners engaged in the key financial processes perform self-assessment on several key controls, document the results, and take corrective action where necessary. ICS supports business and functional management in a periodic cycle of assessment and monitoring of the control environment.\n\nOn an annual basis, management's accountability for business controls is recorded through the formal issuance of a Certification Statement on Business Controls and a Letter of Representation by Divisions, Market Groups, reporting units and Functional management to the Board of Management. Any deficiencies noted in the design and operating effectiveness of controls over financial reporting, which were not completely remediated, are evaluated at year-end by the Board of Management. The Board of Management's statement, including its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting can be found in chapter 13, Statement of the Board of Management, of this Annual Report.\n\nThe global tax strategy and policy are aligned with our business and sustainability strategies and published on the company's website. The Board of Management, enabling functions, Divisions and Market Groups are advised on tax matters by Group tax to ensure both the needs of the business and tax needs are balanced. The company also participates in (inter)national groups of experts to represent its interests.",

These risks can, separately or in combination, have a material adverse effect on Signify's business, strategy, financial condition, results from operations, cash flow, reputation or prospects.\n\n## Technological change\n\n## Competition\n\n## Global political and economic instability - COVID-19\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Risk description\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe transition to LED lighting is characterized by the increasing importance of digital capabilities and technology such as the adoption of connected lighting systems which may drastically change the business environment. At present, a relatively small part of the worldwide installed base of light points is connected and this new market is in its initial stage.\n\nA cornerstone of Signify's strategy is to focus on and invest in its connected lighting offerings such as its InterAct offerings for the professional market and Hue, WiZ smart lighting offerings for the consumer market and to develop new business models, in particular through value-added service offerings.\n\nThe risk is that the extent and speed of the adoption of connected lighting systems and services does not develop as anticipated or Signify is unable to successfully implement its strategy in connected lighting.\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\nSignify is actively developing and investing in technology platforms and software applications to bring (more advanced) connected lighting systems to the market. Part of this strategy is to focus strongly on interoperability of its applications and incorporate different connectivity technologies in its connected lighting portfolio to be able to address different needs in the market.\n\nFurther, Signify plays a leading role in developing the market for connected lighting systems and in building awareness of the benefits of connected lighting and in forging partnerships and alliances. To capture this new value opportunity, Signify's systems and product teams are developing innovative services around connected lighting.\n\nTo counter aggressive commoditization by Asian players, Signify's strategy is to create tiered offerings, including B-brand and private label.\n\nFurther, the company continuously invests in innovation, strengthens its digital (sales) capabilities and runs cost saving initiatives to keep its cost base competitive.\n\nIn addition, Signify can make use of the Philips brand which has a strong global reputation and brand preference to drive sales.\n\nFinally, Signify has a global sales and distribution network along its geographical market groups which it believes would be difficult for a competitor to replicate. This network allows the company to quickly roll-out innovative products and services on a global scale.\n\nSignify closely follows (geo)political and economic developments and takes these into account in its medium-term operational planning.\n\nFurther, Signify actively engages in global forums focused on the benefits of globalization and is committed to highly credible industry organizations globally to support the stabilization of global trade. To mitigate the risk on supply chain efficiencies and tariff impacts, Signify can leverage its global (manufacturing) footprint and makes adjustments to its sourcing base when needed to address geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism.\n\nIn view of continued COVID-19 uncertainty, to avoid supply chain disruptions, actions are launched throughout the organization which primarily are focused on diversifying the supply base.\n\nSignify's market-leading position could be challenged by competition from both existing and potential new competitors.\n\nThe LED lighting market has attracted many new competitors (particularly from Asia) with low-priced offerings and is at present highly competitive. This has led to increasing commoditization of offerings as well as price pressure on LED products.\n\nIncreased commoditization as well as continued significant price pressure on LED products and offerings may impact revenues and profitability, in particular, if Signify fails to manage costs.\n\nWith the shift to connected lighting, the risk is that non-lighting players with broad technology platforms may enter and disrupt the lighting market.\n\nThere continues to be significant instability in the global economy and in the global political landscape.\n\nPolarization and trade protectionism as well as political changes may disrupt our operations and, ultimately, our sales. Such developments may impact Signify significantly as it has commercial activities and operations in almost every country.\n\nAdverse economic conditions may result in lower customer demand. In particular, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on the company's sales in 2020. Uncertainty remains about how quickly the general lighting market may recover to (pre-COVID-19) 2019 levels. This is relevant to Signify as a large part of its business is exposed to the construction and renovation activity which has significantly been impacted by government lockdowns and may take longer to recover.",

Careful balancing will be needed.\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\nThese initiatives are executed via enhanced programs and are continuously monitored. Critical projects are reviewed by the Board of Management.\n\nAll changes made to the organization are closely monitored to ensure that they are implemented in a sustainable manner and do not adversely impact Signify's critical business processes and service levels.\n\nThe initiatives to reduce costs and re-allocate resources to high priority areas include streamlining the workforce, reducing its head office costs, introducing greater efficiencies and reallocating resources to fund its digital roadmap, improving its IT systems, making changes in the go-to-market approach and production footprint, making investments in new technologies and developing new organizational capabilities.\n\nSignify has built a supplier risk plan in which risky suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the geographical location of the supplier, the technologies and processes used. In addition, it actively enhances its regional supply base to ensure that the majority of components needed for manufacturing products for a particular region are sourced regionally as opposed to being sourced them from remote locations.\n\nFurther, Signify requires its sites to have a robust business continuity plan for any large-scale events which can severely impact the business, including sourcing from alternative suppliers and increasing strategic inventories. Finally, regular risk assessments are carried out at individual plant level, including the assessment of risks related to natural catastrophes perils and water scarcity. These assessments are also performed at locations of business-critical suppliers and increasing strategic inventories.\n\nSignify invests significantly in its R&D activities. It has dedicated R&D activities organized throughout the company to support its divisions in developing and realizing near-term innovation roadmaps and to develop longer-term innovations mainly focusing on areas such as connected lighting systems, software and digital applications.\n\nIn 2020 Signify adapted its business structure to enable a stronger customer focus and enhanced specialization to further increase execution speed. Finally, dedicated go-to-market channels and tailored marketing approaches are in place with the aim to successfully introduce new offerings commercially.\n\nSignify increasingly depends on external suppliers and depends for a large part on the production of components and LED products from Asian countries.\n\nThe risk of this dependency is that suppliers are not able to deliver (raw) materials, components or services on time and meet demand in a timely manner. Next to this, the production and shipping of products and components could be interrupted by conflicts, natural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods caused by climate change or pandemic diseases.\n\nIncreasing geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism, such as local manufacturing requirements, may disrupt the company's operations. This may limit the company's ability to leverage and draw efficiencies from its global (manufacturing) footprint.\n\nThe high speed of innovation and the increasing importance of digital technology in the general lighting industry requires Signify to continuously spend considerable resources on developing new products and solutions. It also requires developing different capabilities and competences to commercialize its innovations successfully. In particular, this is important in a fast-changing market in which the company must continuously address the needs of local customers to introduce locally relevant new products and solutions ahead of competition.\n\nThe risk is that the company fails to bring new products and solutions to the markets in a timely fashion and commercialize its innovations successfully. Hence, the expected benefits of these investments may not outweigh the costs to the company.",

Further, a cyber-attack could cause a data breach where sensitive, protected, personal or confidential data held by Signify is leaked or stolen.\n\nNext to this, an increasing number of our products and solutions are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and accompanying (cloud-based) software applications. This is increasing the exposure to cyber security risk.\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\nWe have established a security board where corporate security strategy is approved and monitored. Each year mandatory security and data protection & privacy awareness trainings are conducted.\n\nIT security measures are in place to prevent, detect and respond to attackers from causing damage to systems and gaining access to critical data, systems and services. Business continuity plans are in place in the event of non-availability of IT systems.\n\nSignify is developing its products, software applications and securing the ecosystem in conformity to security standards and best practices (ISA/IEC62443, ISO2700xNIST and CIS).\n\nSignify is actively developing and investing in technology-enabled business platforms and has launched a multi-year digitalization program. These investments are focused on digitization of customer interfaces such as Hue 3.0 and MySignify, internal business processes and IoT platforms such as Interact.\n\nNext to that, several initiatives are deployed throughout the organization to reskill employees to boost digital competencies. Finally, the digital marketing team has been upgraded to strengthen the digital go-to-market approach.\n\nSignify invests in the professional and career development of personnel through learning initiatives as well as through dedicated talent management programs which identify top talents early in their career and plan for development.\n\nIn addition, actions were launched to upscale commercial skills and capabilities in cooperation with learning@signify Academy.\n\nFinally, talent acquisition programs are in place to attract new employees with a specific focus on those (technical) areas where the company sees capability needs that cannot be developed internally.\n\nIt is a strategic priority of Signify to digitalize its go-to-market approach and business processes by building technology platforms that shall address customer needs in a connected world and support the company's growth.\n\nTherefore, digitization and automation of the company's commercial and supply chain processes are the most significant developments Signify needs to focus on. These developments imply an opportunity to provide higher levels of service and product offerings to its customers, while also optimizing workflows and increasing productivity.\n\nFailure to keep up, adapt and use these new technologies will lead to a gradual loss of market share and earnings.\n\nSignify needs to build the capabilities and culture required to transform its business and deliver on its strategy, including the ambition to grow its connected lighting business and grow in new areas such as agricultural, solar, UV-C lighting and 3D printing.\n\nNew capabilities are particularly relevant in the areas of digital, software development, marketing and consultative selling. Next to this, bringing advanced connected lighting offerings to the market requires highly specialized (technical) personnel.\n\nFailure to successfully develop these new and different capabilities may have a significant impact on the company achieving its long-term strategic goals.",

These acquisitions are focused to grow the business, strengthen its supply chain or acquire complementary technologies or new capabilities.\n\nAcquisitions, particularly an acquisition of the size of Cooper Lighting in 2020, always entail integration risk which in turn could result in (cost) synergies, strategic advantages and economies of scale, being delayed or not fully realized.\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\nSignify stresses the importance of any potential acquiree matching its business model and strategic direction. In the due diligence process it makes sure to involve the right people from the organization, considering all vital aspects of the business.\n\nImmediately after the Cooper Lighting acquisition, a multidisciplinary team with members from both organizations was put together and has been working with the aim of ensuring a smooth integration of Cooper Lighting back-office activities into Signify's organization.\n\nAs part of its Brighter Lives, Better World sustainability program, Signify is taking measures to manage climate risks and adapt its businesses.\n\nSignify is committed to 100% carbon neutral operations, 100% renewable electricity and to increase energy efficiency of its products, systems and services to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. Consequently, energy efficiency and circularity are important aspects of new products and as such are part of the company's product creation process.\n\nThe impact of climate change generates opportunities and challenges for Signify's existing and future lighting products and solutions portfolio. In line with that, Signify expects continued and increased attention to climate change from all sectors of society. This attention has led to additional regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adoption of more energyefficient products and solutions.\n\nAs lighting represents a significant portion of global electricity consumption, the lighting industry will need to adapt to changing environmental regulations. One example is the phasing out of conventional lighting technologies, such as halogen lighting technologies in 2018 by the EU.\n\nInability to meet customer expectations related to the energy efficiency potential of the company's LED lighting products and solutions could adversely affect the company reputation and brand.",

It reports on and is accountable for internal risk management and control systems to the Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee. The company has implemented a risk management and internal control system designed to provide reasonable assurance that strategic objectives are met by creating focus, integrating management control over the company's operations, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations and by safeguarding its assets and the reliability of its financial reporting and its disclosures.\n\nThe company has designed its internal control system based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nThe company's risk management approach is embedded in its periodic business planning and review cycle and forms an integral part of business management. On the basis of risk assessments, management determines the risks and appropriate responses related to the achievement of business objectives and critical business processes. Risk factors and the risk management approach are described in more detail in chapter 12, Risk factors and risk management, of this Annual Report. Audit results, relevant investigative activities as well as significant changes and improvements in the company's risk management and internal control system are discussed with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nWith respect to financial reporting a structured self-assessment and monitoring process is used company-wide to assess, document, review and monitor compliance with internal control over financial reporting. Internal representations received from management, regular management reviews, reviews of the design and effectiveness of internal controls and reviews in company and Division, Market and Function Audit Committees are integral parts of the company's risk management approach.",

('the Company') and its subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 2:24b of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Board of Management of the Company and authorized for issue on February 23, 2021 and will be submitted for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 18, 2021.\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, including derivatives (measured at fair value), assets held for sale (measured at the lower of carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell), and definedbenefit pension plans (plan assets are measured at fair value).\n\n## Functional and presentational currency\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR), which is the functional and presentation currency of Signify N.V. All amounts are presented in EUR million and have been rounded to the nearest EUR 100,000 unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding, amounts may not add up to totals provided.\n\n## Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates inherently contain a degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThese estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current and expected future outcomes, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Signify revises material estimates if changes occur in the\n\n## 14.6  Notes to the Consolidated financial statements\n\nIn millions of EUR unless otherwise stated",

The annual test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThe key assumptions of the goodwill impairment test include sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. All key assumptions were updated to reflect management's current best estimates, including the recovery of the global lighting market from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBoth the second and the fourth quarter goodwill impairment tests did not result in an impairment loss being recognized. For further details refer to note 15, Intangible assets.\n\n## Intangible assets, other than goodwill\n\nFor certain intangible assets included in cash-generating units the changes in the economic environment provided an indicator that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Uncertainties in the market and volatility in the financial markets resulted in increased sensitivity in the recoverable amount of the related assets. For the cashgenerating units for which an impairment trigger was identified, an impairment test was performed. In determining the recoverable amounts consideration was given to the uncertainties embedded in the discounted cash flow projections and the appropriateness of key assumptions used in light of the pandemic, which included increased uncertainties around forecasted revenues, profitability and other factors. Based on the tests performed no significant impairments were identified.\n\n## Inventories\n\nSignify's inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In determining the appropriate level of value allowance, inventory health in certain businesses and markets due to COVID-19 were considered. In addition, current and potential excess inventory levels were analyzed, incorporating revised expectations of future demand for these items. No material increase in the value allowance for inventory was identified as a result of these procedures compared to the allowance as of December 31, 2019.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nAccording to its accounting policy, Signify calculates the lifetime expected credit loss for Trade receivables utilizing a matrix model per country, where recoverability data and default probability per country are used as future-looking elements which address COVID-19 impact.\n\ncircumstances or there is new information or experience on which an estimate was or can be based.\n\nThe areas where the most significant judgments and estimates are made are goodwill, deferred tax asset recoverability, revenue recognition, impairments, provisions, employee benefit obligations, inventory valuation and obsolescence provision, estimation of loss allowance for expected credit losses, leases as well as fair value of derivatives, other financial instruments and assets and liabilities in business combinations. For further discussion on these significant judgments and estimates, reference is made to the respective accounting policies and notes within these Consolidated financial statements that relate to the above topics.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented situation globally. From the outset, Signify has taken considerable action focused on the health and safety of its employees, on customer engagement and supply chain continuity and on free cash flow generation and operating expenses optimization.\n\nSignify continues to closely monitor the development of the COVID-19 outbreak by analyzing the risks which the pandemic imposes for its financial results, position and cash flows and implementing mitigating actions promptly.\n\nFurther information and considerations regarding areas of significant judgments and estimates have been included below.\n\n## Liquidity and risk management\n\nAt a very early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, Signify identified a broad range of mitigating actions to preserve liquidity. These measures included, among others, savings in selling expenses, travel costs and procurement costs. This will continue to be a focus point of the organization in the coming years. For example, in January 2021, Signify communicated a further plan that aims to enhance our competitiveness by optimizing our cost base, making our central organization leaner and improving our performance culture. For further details, refer to note 30, Events after the balance sheet date.\n\nSignify has also implemented a range of measures to safeguard cash flow, including rigorous working capital management, the curtailment of uncommitted and non-essential capital expenditure, and the withdrawal of the 2019 dividend proposal in March 2020.\n\nThese measures supported Signify in generating cash flows from operating activities in 2020 of EUR 891 million, which ensures that Signify can meet its future obligations, including repayments to stakeholders communicated on January 13, 2021, such as EUR 350 million early",

The segments are organized based on the nature of the products and services. 'Other' represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes certain costs related to central R&D activities to drive innovation as well as group enabling functions.\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored internally for management purposes. Previously, the cash-generating units for goodwill testing were the four Business Groups. As a result of the organizational changes, the cash-generating units for goodwill testing have also been updated to correspond to the new operating segments. The goodwill of BG LED and BG Home were combined into the goodwill of the new Division Digital Products.\n\nThe financial impact per segment is disclosed in note 3, Information by segment and main country.\n\n## New and amended standards adopted by the group\n\nSignify has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 Impact of the initial application of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7\n- \u00b7 Impact of the initial application of COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions Amendments to IFRS 16\n- \u00b7 Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards\n- \u00b7 Definition of a Business - Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations\n- \u00b7 Definition of Material - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8.\n\nSignify changed its accounting policies in accordance with the standards and amendments listed above. The changes did not have any significant impact on the amounts recognized in the prior period and current period.\n\n## New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nThe following new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are mandatory for January 1, 2021 or later reporting periods and have not been adopted early by Signify:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations\n\nCollection of Trade receivables was strong in 2020, as a result, Signify's expected credit loss allowance as of December 31, 2020 has not increased materially when compared to the allowance as of December 31, 2019. Furthermore, the allowance for individually impaired receivables did not increase materially compared to the allowance as of December 31, 2019.\n\n## Post-employment benefits\n\nCOVID-19 impacted underlying assumptions of post-employment liabilities such as the interest rates and investment performance. Signify performed an updated quantification of the net defined benefit liability as at December 31, 2020 based on the most recent assumptions. Details of the underlying assumptions used can be found in note 25, Postemployment benefits.\n\n## Government support\n\nIn response to COVID-19, many governments provided support through incentives, changed tax policies aimed at deferring tax filings and payments and provided tax relief. Apart from applied payment deferrals on other taxes/levies, the impact of government support received is not significant.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nIn the context of COVID-19, Signify has also assessed whether it is still probable that deferred tax assets recognized on the balance sheet will be realized. No derecognition as a result of this assessment was recorded.\n\n## Changes in accounting policy\n\n## Changes in reporting segments\n\nOperating segments are components of Signify's business activities for which separate financial information is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Board of Management of the Company). Effective Q2 2020, to further adapt to the industry transition and strengthen customer centricity, Signify changed the organizational structure, which included changing the four business groups (BG's) into three divisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Division Digital Solutions (formerly BG Professional, including Cooper Lighting) offers luminaires, lighting systems and services for the Internet of Things to customers in the professional segment;\n- \u00b7 Division Digital Products (combines BG LED and BG Home). This division offers LED lamps, LED luminaires and connected products, including Hue and WiZ, and LED electronics to professional customers, OEM partners and consumers. By bringing together its entire consumer LED portfolio, Signify can better manage this lighting category for its channel partners; and\n- \u00b7 Division Conventional Products (formerly BG Lamps) continues to focus on conventional lamps and electronics for professional customers, OEM partners and consumers. It is",

Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. If Signify retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nSignify's investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in associates are recognized initially at cost. Investments in associates are those entities in which Signify has significant influence, but no control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Signify entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency').\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation when items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income, except when deferred in Other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. The exchange differences are presented as part of Cost of sales, except for tax items and Financial income and expense, which are recognized in the same line item as they relate to.\n\nUpon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of non-euro entities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments at the time of the acquisition, are translated into euros at the year-end rates of exchange. The items of the statement of income of foreign activities, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated at the rates which are approximating the rates at the dates of transactions. The resulting translation differences of the net investments in foreign operations are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the goods. For standard sale of products, control generally passes to the customer at the time the product is delivered and accepted, depending on the delivery conditions and incoterms. Revenue is recognized at the amount to which Signify expects to be entitled. The transaction price excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37, Provision, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Assets\n- \u00b7 Annual Improvements 2018 -2020\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nThese standards are not expected to have a material impact on Signify in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\n\n## 2 Significant accounting policies\n\n## General\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by Signify.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Signify N.V. and all subsidiaries it controls (i.e. when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee). The existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to Signify. Signify measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus\n- \u00b7 the recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; plus\n- \u00b7 if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less\n- \u00b7 the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.",

The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional.\n\nContract liabilities consist of deferred income and payments received in advance and are recorded under Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities. Deferred income includes balances related to royalties, extended warranty, life-cycle services as well as other services such as cloud-enabled services. Advances from customers mostly comprises payments received in advance for projects, for which Signify still needs to satisfy (part of) the performance obligations.\n\n## Other\n\nSignify may incur costs for obtaining a contract, including payments made to agents that depend on winning the contract. Signify applies the practical expedient from IFRS 15, allowing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract to be expensed if the associated amortization period is 12 months or less. As a result, no amounts of contract costs were recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n## Income and expenses\n\nSignify applies accrual accounting. This means that expenses are recognized when incurred and Income is recognized when earned, irrespective of the actual cash flows.\n\nShipping and handling expenses related to sales to third parties are generally recorded as Selling, general and administrative expenses. When shipping and handling is part of a project and billed to the customer, then the related expenses are recorded as Cost of sales. Shipping and handling billed to customers is recognized as Sales.\n\nAdvertising and promotion costs and costs related to the brand license fee are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The costs of conversion of inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable production overheads, considering the stage of completion and the normal capacity of production facilities. Costs of idle facility and abnormal waste are expensed. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Due to price erosion and technological developments, inventory valuation requires forward looking estimates on future sales levels, future price erosion and related expected gross margin percentages. On each reporting date, management performs an analysis of net realizable values and determines the lower of cost and net realizable value to measure its inventories. The write-down is included in Cost of sales.\n\nsales taxes. Payments made to customers for distinct goods or services are excluded from the revenue recognized and recorded as part of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Signify does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of significant financing component if, at contract inception, it is expected that the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is one year or less. This applies to most sales transactions. The transaction price may be variable due to discounts, rebates or similar arrangements. Revenue is only recognized for the part of the consideration for which it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Judgment is required in determining the probability and level of discounts and rebates that will be granted. The estimate is updated throughout the term of the contract.\n\nFor products for which a right to return exists during a defined period, revenue is recognized by considering the historical pattern of actual returns. Return policies are typically based on customary return arrangements in local markets.\n\n## Sale of services\n\nSignify regards cloud-enabled services, extended warranty and lifecycle services as separate performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the different performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling prices. Revenue for these services is recognized over time when the performance obligation is satisfied, which in most cases is proportionally over the duration of the service period.\n\n## Transactions with multiple performance obligations\n\nWhen a single contract contains multiple deliverables, for example supply of goods and services, these multiple deliverables may be combined in one or more performance obligations. For these transactions, Signify accounts for individual goods and services, including any goods or services provided for free, separately in case they are distinct. Performance obligations may be satisfied over time, typically because Signify is creating or enhancing an asset that the customer controls. In limited cases, Signify may also be creating an asset with no alternative use while having an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. In both instances, revenue is recognized over time. The total consideration of the contract is allocated to all distinct performance obligations in the contract based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on other stand-alone sales transactions that are directly observable, when possible. However, observable prices are not available for all performance obligations. If no direct observable prices are available, the stand-alone selling price is normally based on the expected cost plus a margin approach.\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets mostly comprise of unbilled positions, where Signify has, partially or in full, satisfied performance obligations but not yet billed the customer. These are recorded under",

        "page_content": "SIGNIFY AR2020 -5e proef - 18/2/2021\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired\n\nor\n\n- \u00b7 Signify has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) Signify has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, Signify continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, Signify also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that Signify has retained.\n\n## Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nSignify estimates lifetime expected loss allowance for all Trade receivables and Contract assets via calculating the expected credit losses. Trade receivables and contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due whereby the lifetime expected credit loss on the Trade receivables is recognized based on a matrix model calculated per country, which utilizes historical recoverability data and default probability per country.\n\nAs soon as individual trade accounts receivable can no longer be collected in a normal course of business and are expected to result in a loss, they are designated as doubtful trade accounts receivable and valued at the expected collectible amounts. They are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectable because of bankruptcy or other form of receivership at the debtors. Any previously recognized expected loss is offset against the carrying amount of such trade receivable and the difference is taken as a loss accounted for within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Impairment of other financial assets\n\nSignify assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its debt instruments carried at amortized cost. Signify determines impairment amount based on the three stages of credit risk deterioration. The criteria to pass on to the next stage of the credit deterioration Is established for individual financial assets or group of financial assets with similar characteristics, considering credit risk profile of the counterparty, historical default data and macroeconomic factors.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition\n\nA financial asset or liability is recognized when Signify becomes party to a contract that is a financial instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are accounted for at the trade date. Initial measurement of financial assets and liabilities is at fair value. Dividend income is recognized when declared.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nClassification and subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on Signify's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows and solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test. Signify performs the analysis instrument by instrument, which utilizes contract details, business model and objective of the instrument in order to classify financial asset or liability into one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at amortized cost as the business model for these instruments is hold-tocollect contractual cash flows. These are mainly Trade and Other Receivables, which are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance and net of discounts given or agreed if the offset requirements are met.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value via profit and loss (FVPL), as the business model for these instruments is held for trading. Derivatives and other financial assets at fair value are Included in this category.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) with no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment as the business model for these instruments is hold-tocollect contractual cash flows and sell. Minor equity investments are included in this category.\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are all classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost, except for financial liabilities at fair value via profit and loss, for example derivatives, contingent consideration in a business acquisition, to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value with changes recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nSignify presents financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis as separate line items in the Consolidated statement of financial position unless the offset criteria are met.\n\nThe offsetting criteria are met if Signify has a legal right to offset financial assets with financial liabilities and if Signify intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. To meet the requirement, the right of set-off should be available today and not contingent on a future event and it should be legally enforceable for all counterparties in a normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.",

Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized within the Cost of sales in the Consolidated statement of income, except for derivatives that are effective and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which are recorded in Other comprehensive income until the Consolidated statement of income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Changes in the fair value of hedges related to intercompany loans and deposits are recognized within Financial income and expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe derivatives used by Signify can be subject to master netting and set-off agreements with financial counterparties. In case of certain termination events, under the terms of these Master Agreements, Signify can terminate the outstanding transactions and aggregate their positive and negative values to arrive at a single net termination sum (or close-out amount). This contractual right is, amongst others, subject to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The right may be limited by local law if the counterparty is subject to bankruptcy proceedings.\n- \u00b7 The right applies on a bilateral basis.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly within equity or in Other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially-enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the balance sheet method, for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, Signify documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. Signify documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.\n\nFor foreign currency forwards, Signify designates the spot component of the change in fair value in cash flow hedge relationships. The spot component is determined with reference to the relevant spot market exchange rates. The differential between the contracted forward rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as forward points. It is discounted, where material. Changes in the fair value related to forward points are continuously recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nSignify hedges its investments in certain subsidiaries by entering derivatives which mitigate the foreign currency translation risk arising from the subsidiaries net assets. Such hedge is accounted for as a net investment hedge. Signify designates full instrument in the hedge relationship. The result of hedging of the translation risk, using net investment hedges is recognized in the Currency translation differences within equity, as can be seen in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as long as the hedge is effective.\n\nSignify measures all derivative financial instruments at fair value derived from market prices of the instruments or calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. These calculations are tested for reasonableness by comparing the outcome of the internal valuation with the valuation received from the counterparty.\n\nSignify monitors that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and hedge ratio is the same as the one Signify uses for the risk management purposes. A prospective effectiveness test is performed to prove that the hedge is effective. For the prospective effectiveness test Signify utilizes the dollar offset method.\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal due to the different timing or amount of the underlying transaction, but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, Signify performs re-balancing of the hedge relationship by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item, so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for the risk management purposes. Gains and losses that were accumulated in equity related to an ineffective portion of hedge, Signify records immediately in the Consolidated statement of income when such ineffectiveness occurs.",

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of time value of money. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. Significant judgment is required in determining the amount and probability of resources outflow and discount rates used to calculate the present value of this outflow. A liability is recognized if timing and amount of the settlement can be reliably estimated.\n\nThe accounting and presentation for some of Signify's provisions is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring related provisions - The provision for restructuring relates to the estimated costs of programs that are planned and controlled by management that materially change the scope of our business or the manner in which it is conducted. A provision is recognized when Signify has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation that Signify will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan, or by announcing the plan's main features to those affected by it.\n- \u00b7 Environmental provisions - Measurement of liabilities associated with environmental obligations is based on current legal and constructive requirements. Liabilities and expected insurance recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. The carrying amount of environmental provisions is regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts and changes in law.\n- \u00b7 Product warranty - A provision for product warranty is made at the time of revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to the products. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighing of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.\n- \u00b7 Litigation provisions - In relation to legal claim provisions and settlements, the relevant balances are transferred to Other liabilities at the point the amount and timing of cash flows are no longer uncertain. Settlements which are agreed for amounts in excess of existing provisions are reflected as payables.\n- \u00b7 Onerous contract provisions - Provisions are recognized for a contract if it is onerous. The present obligation under the contract is measured and recognized as a provision. An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\nauthority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the income is to be paid out as dividend in the foreseeable future and for undistributed earnings of unconsolidated companies to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable or deductible.\n\nChanges in tax rates are reflected in the period when the change has been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. The evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires judgment about the future taxable profitability of the legal entity holding the tax loss carry forward. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A lack of future taxable profits or taxable profits below the level of current estimates, may cause deferred tax assets to be impaired.\n\nThe ultimate tax effects of transactions may be uncertain for a considerable period of time, requiring management to estimate the related current and deferred tax treatments. In assessing the uncertainty, Signify considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept or revise the uncertain tax treatment. Income tax payable include liabilities for uncertain tax positions which are recognized when it is probable that tax will be due. To the extent uncertain tax positions relate to deferred tax assets these are offset against each other. Actual tax assessments in relation to these uncertain tax positions may significantly deviate from estimates.\n\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, Signify takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes Signify to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.",

It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Significant judgment in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n\nSignify determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. When determining the lease term, Signify considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. These circumstances include Signify's strategic plans, the industrial footprint of Signify and divisions and the importance of the site to Signify's operations.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is described under accounting policy, Business combinations, above. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of investments in associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such investment is allocated to the investment as a whole.\n\n## Intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nThe fair value of other intangible assets, mainly customer relations, brand names and technology based intangibles acquired through business combinations is determined using a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of an asset based on market participants' expectations of the cash flows associated with that asset over its remaining useful life. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The useful lives are evaluated annually. Intangible assets are initially capitalized at cost, with the exception of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value.\n\nExpenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalized as an intangible asset if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, cost can be reliably measured, Signify has sufficient resources and the intention to complete development.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWhen the potential cash outflow is possible or remote and the risk covered by a guarantee is\n\nnot a financial risk, Signify applies off-balance sheet treatment to such guarantees. For example, environmental remediation and legal proceedings. When the expectation of the cash outflow becomes probable such guarantees become provisions, see guidance above.\n\nWhen guarantees are covering credit risk or any other financial risk they are accounted for as financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Leases\n\nSignify entered into contracts that conveys the right to use the identified asset and as such Signify accounted for these contracts as a lessee.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nSignify recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless Signify is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, Signify recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include (in-substance) fixed payments (less any lease incentives), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by Signify and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects Signify exercising the option to terminate. In calculating the present value of lease payments, Signify uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.",

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with the greater of its value in use and fair value less cost of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset is deemed not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of impairment are recognized in the Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Pension and other employee benefits\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nSignify's retirement benefit obligation is calculated by an independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method. This calculation is performed separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the benefit that employees have earned in relation to their past services. The measurement date for all defined benefit plans is December 31. For plans with a relatively low defined-benefit obligation, Signify may decide to calculate the defined-benefit obligation with a lower frequency. The liability recognized in the Consolidated statement of financial position is the present value of these benefits at the end of the reporting period (defined-benefit obligation) less the fair value of plan assets. The defined-benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a discount yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds with durations matching the terms of the benefits.\n\nThe increase in the defined-benefit obligation due to the passage of time and the expected return on plan assets, using the same interest rate as for the defined-benefit obligation, are included in the pension costs. Interest on the net defined-benefit obligation is recognized in Financing income and expenses in the Consolidated income statement.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized comprises all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Other development expenditures and expenditures on research activities are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. Capitalized development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization of capitalized development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated statement of income on a straight- line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets in Research and development expenses.\n\nAmortization of other intangible assets is reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses for brand names and customer relationships and in Cost of sales for technologybased and other intangible assets.\n\n## Expected useful lives of intangible assets excluding goodwill in years\n\n| Product development   | 1-5   |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| Software              | 1-10  |\n| Technology            | 1-20  |\n| Customer relations    | 2-20  |\n| Brand names           | 2-20  |\n| Other                 | 2-10  |\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized but tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require impairment testing. Signify performed and completed annual impairment tests in the last quarter of the financial year. Judgment is required when analyzing impairments triggers and tests of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use. These analyses are based on the estimation of the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income whenever and to the extent that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the unit's recoverable amount, which is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use or fair value less costs to sell is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset via its use or sale with deduction of costs directly associated with its use or sale.",

Non-current assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Comparatives in the balance sheet are not changed when a non-current asset is classified as held-for-sale.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nWhen the economy of a country in which Signify operates is deemed hyperinflationary and the functional currency of a Signify entity is the currency of that hyperinflationary economy, the financial statements of such entity are adjusted so that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. This involves restatement of income and expenses to reflect changes in the general price index from the start of the reporting period and restatement of non-monetary items in the balance sheet, such as property, plant and equipment and inventory to reflect current purchasing power as at the period end using a general price index from the date when they were first recognized. Comparative amounts are not adjusted. Any differences arising were recorded in equity on adoption.\n\n## Equity\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Dividends are recognized as a liability in the period in which they are declared. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\nTreasury shares that are reacquired are recognized at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date, and deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued. When reissued, shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. When treasury shares are delivered under Signify's share plans, the difference between the market price of the shares delivered and the cost is recorded in retained earnings, the market price is recorded in share premium. Upon cancellation, treasury shares are deducted from the share capital at their nominal value of EUR 0.01 per share and retained earnings for the difference.\n\nCosts including dividend withholding tax in connection with Signify's purchase of treasury shares for capital reduction purposes are recorded in retained earnings.\n\nPast-service costs are recognized immediately in the Personnel costs in the Consolidated income statement. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity via other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\n\nWhen a plan is changed, settled or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in the defined-benefit obligation that relates to past-service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in the statement of income. Signify recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\nSignify presents all net defined-benefit post-employment obligations on one line within non-current liabilities on the Statement of financial position.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nContributions to defined-contribution plans are recognized in the Consolidated income statement in Personnel expenses as incurred.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by Signify before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Signify recognizes termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to a termination and when they have a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current employees without possibility of withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nSignify's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such as jubilee entitlements. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis. Signify recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and incentives based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to Signify's shareholders after certain adjustments.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts form an integral part of Signify's cash management and",

Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\n## Consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nThe Consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Cash flows from other derivative instruments are classified consistent with the nature of the instrument. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated into euros using the exchange rate at the date of the cash flow.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nSignify presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Signify N.V. by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprises of restricted shares, conditional shares and performance shares granted to employees.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and Signify will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the Consolidated statement of income over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives and residual values are evaluated annually. The costs of property, plant and equipment comprise of all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Government grants for assets are deducted from the cost of the related asset.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is calculated using the straight-line method taking into account the residual values and estimated useful lives and is primarily included in Cost of sales. Freehold land is not depreciated. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in Other business income. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless leading to an extension of the original lifetime of capacity.\n\nThe expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n## Useful lives Pproperty, plant and equipment in years\n\n| Building                    | from 5 to 50   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| Machinery and installations | from 3 to 20   |\n| Other equipment             | from 1 to 10   |\n| Right-of-use assets         | from 2 to 20   |\n\n## Share-based compensation expenses\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.\n\nThe grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as personnel expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the award. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period.\n\nService and non-market performance conditions are not considered when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value.",

The difference is primarily due to the one-time non-cash tax benefit from changes in the organizational structure as referred to in sub-section 4.5 and the impact of tax rate changes.\n\nThe impact of changes in the organizational structure is included in the 'Tax incentives and exempt income\" line offset by by \"changes in the liability for uncertain tax positions\" and \"changes in tax rates\". The increase of our liability for uncertain tax positions is mainly relating to transfer pricing uncertainties resulting from these changes in our organizational structure. The line item 'Changes in tax rates' includes a non-cash tax benefit of EUR 32 million related to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets following the cancellation of the planned statutory tax rate decrease in the Netherlands. The effects of tax rate changes are included in the reported tax balances based on the information available per reporting date. In 2019, the changes in tax rates in the Netherlands and India resulted in a tax benefit of EUR 3 million.\n\n## 8 Financial income and expenses\n\n|                                                                                | Note   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income                                                                |        | 14     | 16     |\n| Change in fair value of financial assets at fair  value through profit or loss | 29     | 1      | 2      |\n| Other financial income                                                         |        | 2      | -      |\n| Financial income                                                               |        | 17     | 18     |\n| Interest expense                                                               | 23     | (22)   | (39)   |\n| Interest on the net defined-benefit                                            |        |        |        |\n| obligation                                                                     | 25     | (14)   | (8)    |\n| Interest expense on lease liability                                            | 23     | (7)    | (7)    |\n| Change in fair value of financial assets at fair  value through profit or loss | 29     | (1)    | (3)    |\n| Net foreign exchange losses                                                    |        | (4)    | 1      |\n| Impairment loss of financial assets                                            |        | -      | -      |\n| Other financial expenses                                                       | 23     | (12)   | (14)   |\n| Financial expenses                                                             |        | (60)   | (72)   |\n| Financial income and expenses                                                  |        | (43)   | (54)   |\n\n## 9 Income taxes\n\nThe components of income tax expense were as follows:\n\n|                              | 2019   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax (expense)        | (86)   | (142)  |\n| Prior year benefit (expense) | 1      | 3      |\n| Current tax expense          | (85)   | (139)  |\n\n|                                                                         | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences                       | (6)    | 121    |\n| Change in tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences  recognized | (4)    | (16)   |\n| Tax rate changes                                                        | 3      | 11     |\n| Prior year benefit (expense)                                            | -      | (4)    |\n| Deferred income tax expense                                             | (8)    | 112    |",

An amount of EUR 132 million of deferred tax assets relates to several tax jurisdictions in which Signify has suffered a loss in the current or preceding period. Management's projections support the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate enough taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets.",

These uncertainties include, among others, the following:\n\n## Transfer pricing uncertainties\n\nSignify has issued transfer pricing directives, which are in accordance with international guidelines, such as those of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As transfer pricing has a cross-border effect, potential adjustments by local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country. In order to reduce the transfer pricing uncertainties, monitoring procedures are carried out by Group Tax and Internal Audit to safeguard the correct implementation of the transfer pricing directives.\n\n## Tax uncertainties on general and specific service agreements and licensing agreements\n\nDue to the centralization of certain activities in a limited number of countries (such as research and development, IT, group functions and head office), costs are also centralized. Consequently, these costs and/or revenues must be allocated to the beneficiaries, i.e. the various Signify entities. This could lead to discussions with local tax authorities if they do not accept these charges. For that purpose, service contracts such as intra-group service agreements and licensing agreements are signed with Signify group entities. Tax authorities review these intra-group service and licensing agreements and may reject the implemented intra-group charges.\n\n## Tax uncertainties due to permanent establishments\n\nSignify may encounter tax uncertainties, due to permanent establishments in countries where new operations are started or business models are altered. This is because when operations in a country involve a foreign Signify organization, there is a risk that tax claims will arise in the former country as well as in the latter country.\n\nWhen Signify has cross-border operations, there is a risk that tax claims will arise in all relevant countries.\n\nWith regard to these uncertainties, income tax payable is recognized when it is probable that additional taxes will be due. In addition, related to similar uncertainties, an indemnification liability to Koninklijke Philips N.V of EUR 51 million (2019: EUR 55 million) and an indemnification receivable of EUR 13 million (2019: EUR 18 million) is recorded. The total net liability increased in 2020 by EUR 1 million mainly due to settlements and expirations.\n\nFor 2020, the column \"recognized in income statement\" in the table above includes the impact of changes in the organizational structure. The column 'Other' includes foreign currency translation differences, acquisitions, the impact of the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances relating to Pensions and other post-retirement benefits and the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 (2019).\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the temporary differences associated with investments, including potential income tax consequences on dividends for which no deferred tax liabilities are recognized, aggregate to EUR 271 million (2019: EUR 272 million).\n\nAt December 31, 2020, net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:\n\n## Expiry year operating loss carryforwards\n\n|   Total |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |   2024 |   2025 |   After 2025  but not  unlimited |   Unlimited |\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------------------------|-------------|\n|     633 |      1 |      1 |      1 |      2 |     13 |                                7 |         608 |\n\n## Unrecognized tax losses and tax credits\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the amount of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized in the balance sheet was EUR 541 million (2019: EUR 487 million).\n\nOut of EUR 541 million, an amount of EUR 520 million should not be limited in time, EUR 1 million will expire by 2021, EUR 1 million will expire by 2022, EUR 1 million will expire by 2024, EUR 5 million will expire by 2025 and EUR 13 million expires after 2025, but carryforward is limited in time.\n\n## Unrecognized deductible temporary differences\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the amount of deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset has been recognized in the balance sheet is EUR 106 million (2019: EUR 60 million).\n\nClassification of the income tax payable and receivable is as follows:\n\n|                                                      | 2019   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income tax receivable under other current assets     | 48     | 39     |\n| Income tax receivable under other non-current assets | 8      | 8      |\n| Income tax payable under current liabilities         | (22)   | (20)   |\n| Income tax payable under non-current liabilities     | (52)   | (108)  |",

The sales growth rates and EBITA used to estimate cash flows are based on past performance, external market growth assumptions, taking into account impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and industry long-term growth averages.\n\nFor Digital Solutions, EBITA is expected to increase over the projection period as a result of volume growth, cost efficiencies, and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flow projections for 2020 and 2019 were based on the key assumptions included in the table below:\n\n## Key assumptions in %\n\n|                        | Compound sales growth rate  1   | Compound sales growth rate  1   | Compound sales growth rate  1        | Compound sales growth rate  1   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                        | Initial forecast  period        | Extra polation  period          | Used   to calculate   terminal value | Pre-tax   discount rates        |\n|                        | 2                               |                                 |                                      |                                 |\n| Digital Solutions 2020 | 9.7                             | 3.6                             | 0.3                                  | 11.2                            |\n| Digital Solutions 2019 | 3.5                             | 2.4                             | 0.3                                  | 10.6                            |\n\n- 1 Compound sales growth rate is the annualized steady growth rate over the forecast period.\n- 2 The CAGR% for the initial forecast period is presented as if Cooper Lighting would have been part of Signify in 2019 for comparability purposes.\n\nThe impairment test of Q4 2020 assumes a recovery of the global lighting market to 95% of its pre-COVID-19 projected level for 2025. In addition, Signify performed a sensitivity analysis and noted that even in the case of a recovery to 90% of its pre-COVID-19 projected level by 2025, no impairment is identified.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThe additions for 2020 contain internally generated assets of EUR 13 million for product development and EUR 18 million for software. In 2020, acquired other intangible assets are Customer relationships of EUR 335 million, Technology based of EUR 69 million, Brand names of EUR 103 million, and Software EUR 1 million which all relate to Cooper Lighting.\n\nThe capitalized product development costs and software, for which amortization has not yet commenced, amounted to EUR 22 million as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: EUR 15 million).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of the customer relationships originating from the Genlyte acquisition in 2007 was EUR 66 million (USD 81 million) with a remaining amortization period of 2.1 years (2019: EUR 108 million, USD 121 million; 3.1 years). The carrying amount of the customer relationships originating from the Cooper Lighting acquisition in 2020 was EUR 286 million (USD 352 million) with a remaining amortization period of 19.8 years.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, a translation difference of EUR 206 million was mainly due to the change in the USD/EUR rate which impacted the goodwill denominated in USD. The goodwill related to Cooper Lighting acquisition of EUR 515 million is recognized in Division Digital Solutions.\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored internally for management purposes. The cash-generating units correspond to the operating segments. Due to a change in Signify's organizational structure, the cash-generating units for goodwill impairment testing have been updated to be based on the new operating segments. Refer to note 1, Basis of preparation, for further details.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit Digital Solutions is considered to be significant in comparison to the total book value of goodwill of Signify at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2020, is presented below.\n\n|                       | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Digital Solutions  1  | 1,573  | 1,902  |\n| Digital Products      | 307    | 296    |\n| Conventional Products | 62     | 53     |\n| Book value            | 1,943  | 2,251  |\n\n- 1 2020 includes Cooper Lighting.\n\nThe basis of the recoverable amount used of the cash-generating units is the value in use. As mentioned in note 1, Basis of preparation, the impact of COVID-19 resulted in Signify performing a goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of the year but no impairment was identified as the estimated recoverable amount of the cash-generating units exceeded the carrying value. In the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2020, the estimated recoverable amount of the cash-generating units tested exceeded the carrying value of the units. Therefore, no impairment loss was recognized.\n\nKey assumptions used in the impairment tests for the units were sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. These cash flow projections were determined using management's internal forecasts that cover an initial period from 2021 to 2023 that matches the period used for our strategic process. Projections were extrapolated with declining growth rates for a period of five years, after which a terminal value was",

Signify remains focused on maintaining a robust capital structure and is committed to an investment grade rating. Signify prioritizes deleveraging with free cash flow expected to drive down Signify's net leverage ratio from around 1.7x at December 31, 2020 to below 1x net debt/ EBITDA by the end of 2022. Signify manages free cash flow performance by continuous structural working capital initiatives and gradual costs optimization, including post-merger integration costs related to acquisition of Cooper Lighting as described in note 11, Acquisitions and divestments.\n\nSignify is subject to certain debt covenants, for details refer to note 23, Debt.\n\nFree cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 and comparative information are presented below:\n\n|                                                           | 2019   | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                      | 599    | 891      |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                      | (145)  | ( 1,379) |\n| Cash flows before financing activities                    | 454    | (488)    |\n| Cash flows from operating activities                      | 599    | 891      |\n| Net capital expenditures:                                 |        |          |\n| \u00b7 Additions of intangible assets                          | (29)   | (32)     |\n| \u00b7 Capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment   | (58)   | (67)     |\n| \u00b7 Proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment | 16     | 25       |\n| Free cash flows                                           | 529    | 817      |\n\nWorking capital position as at December 31, 2020 and comparative information are presented below:\n\n|                             | 2019     | 2020       |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Inventories                 | 874      | 885        |\n| Trade and other receivables | 1,223    | 1,140      |\n| Trade and other payables    | ( 1,684) | ( 1,7 3 1) |\n| Other working capital items | (25)     | 19         |\n| Working capital             | 388      | 313        |",

At the same time, the revolving credit facility (RCF) of EUR 500 million was refinanced for the same amount with a five-year maturity plus two one-year extension options. The term loans and RCF agreement include a financial covenant providing that Signify maintains a net leverage ratio of no greater than 3.5x. The net leverage ratio may temporarily increase to 4.0x within 12 months of the closing of the Cooper Lighting acquisition or other material acquisitions. The covenant does not apply if Signify has at least one investment grade rating, which is currently the case, as Signify has two investment grade ratings.\n\nThe new term loan structure bears interest at a variable rate based on the relevant applicable EURIBOR and USD LIBOR respectively with zero floor plus a margin. As of December 31, 2020, the margin was 0.65% for the term loans maturing in January 2023 and 0.75% for the term\n\nloans maturing in January 2025, and is subject to change depending on the public credit rating of Signify assigned by rating agencies.\n\nAs of September 2020, following the repayment of EUR 350 million of debt, the committed term loan structure consists of EUR 50 million and USD 275 million maturing in January 2023 and EUR 340 million and USD 225 million maturing in January 2025.\n\n## Eurobonds issuance\n\nIn May 2020, Signify issued EUR 675 million of fixed rate notes due in May 2024 with a coupon of 2.000% and EUR 600 million of fixed rate notes due in May 2027 with a coupon of 2.375%. The net proceeds of the notes were used to repay the bridge loan used to finance the acquisition of Cooper Lighting.",

        "page_content": "SIGNIFY AR2020 -5e proef - 18/2/2021\n\n## Restructuring\n\nThe provision for restructuring relates primarily to restructuring programs in Division Conventional Products, mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. Signify expects the provision will be utilized mainly within next year.\n\n## Environmental provision\n\nSignify is exposed to environment risks, mainly because it has been in the business of manufacturing products for more than a century. During that period, Signify has opened, discontinued and acquired many manufacturing plants and sites. Some of these plants and sites have been used for industrial purposes for decades and as such, there is a latent risk that these premises may have environmental conditions that require corrective actions as a result of such use. The environmental provisions include accrued costs recorded with respect to environmental remediation in various countries. Provisions for environmental remediation can change significantly due to the emergence of additional information regarding the extent or nature of the contamination, the need to utilize alternative technologies, actions by regulatory authorities as well as changes in judgments and discount rates. The environmental provision is expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n## Product warranty\n\nManufacturing of Signify's products involves complex processes and defects might occur. In addition, it is possible that some of Signify's products may not perform as expected (for example, in terms of estimated life span and projected energy savings). These defects or shortfalls may cause Signify to incur significant warranty, support and replacement costs. The provision for product warranty reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-ofcharge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to products sold. Signify expects the provision will be mainly utilized within the next two years.\n\n## Other\n\nSignify and certain of its group companies are involved in legal proceedings relating to such matters as product liability and claims for property damage and personal injury, alleged to have been caused by failure or malfunction of its products as well as commercial transactions, and intellectual property infringements (among others). The outcome of asserted claims and proceedings, or the impact of any claims that may be asserted in the future, cannot be predicted with certainty. Signify makes provisions if payments with respect to such matters are probable and the amount can be estimated reliably. Furthermore, other provisions mainly comprise of provisions for self-insurance, decommissioning and provision for employee jubilee funds. Other provisions are expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n## 24 Provisions\n\n|                                              | Restruc- turing-  related  provisions   | Environ- mental  Provisions   | Product  warranty   | Other  provisions   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| Balance as at January 1, 2019                | 99                                      | 115                           | 42                  | 140                 | 396     |\n| Additions                                    | 82                                      | 6                             | 44                  | 34                  | 166     |\n| Utilizations                                 | (97)                                    | (15)                          | (45)                | (32)                | (188)   |\n| Reclassifications                            | 2                                       | 0                             | -                   | 0                   | 1       |\n| Releases                                     | (9)                                     | (2)                           | -                   | (8)                 | (19)    |\n| Changes in discount rate                     | -                                       | 3                             | -                   | 1                   | 4       |\n| Accretion                                    | -                                       | 1                             | -                   | 1                   | 2       |\n| Translation differences and other  movements | -                                       | 1                             | -                   | 1                   | 2       |\n| Balance as at December 31, 2019              | 78                                      | 110                           | 41                  | 136                 | 365     |\n| Short-term                                   | 61                                      | 21                            | 25                  | 41                  | 149     |\n| Long-term                                    | 17                                      | 89                            | 16                  | 94                  | 216     |\n| Balance as at January 1, 2020                | 78                                      | 110                           | 41                  | 136                 | 365     |\n| Acquisitions                                 | 0                                       | 5                             | 34                  | 20                  | 58      |\n| Additions                                    | 72                                      | 8                             | 62                  | 40                  | 182     |\n| Utilizations                                 | (52)                                    | (10)                          | (61)                | (42)                | (165)   |\n| Releases                                     | (13)                                    | (1)                           | -                   | (14)                | (28)    |\n| Changes in discount rate                     | -                                       | 0                             | -                   | 2                   | 2       |\n| Accretion                                    | -                                       | 1                             | -                   | 1                   | 1       |\n| Translation differences and other  movements | (1)                                     | (3)                           | (6)                 | (10)                | (21)    |\n| Balance as at December 31, 2020              | 84                                      | 109                           | 70                  | 133                 | 396     |\n| Short-term                                   | 68                                      | 28                            | 37                  | 39                  | 172     |\n| Long-term                                    | 16                                      | 81                            | 33                  | 94                  | 224     |",

This plan has been closed for new entrants since January 1, 2018. Since 2016, Signify no longer makes any contributions to this plan but funds the liabilities when these are paid out to retirees. New employees accrue pension benefits through a defined-contribution plan. For other closed defined-benefit plans, Signify has an unfunded liability of EUR 203 million as at December 31, 2020. Signify expects cash outflows of EUR 18 million in 2021 for the pension plans.\n\nCash outflows for the defined-benefit plans in countries other than the USA and Germany are expected to total EUR 12 million in 2021.\n\n## Risks related to defined-benefit plans\n\nThe defined-benefit plans expose Signify to various demographic and economic risks, such as longevity, investment, currency and interest rate risks and, in some cases, inflation risk. The latter plays a role in the assumed wage increase and in some smaller plans where indexation is mandatory.\n\nThe larger plans are governed by either independent boards, committees or trustees who have a legal obligation to evenly balance the interests of all stakeholders and operate under the local regulatory frameworks. These boards and trustees are responsible for and have full discretion over the investment strategy of the plan assets, in general they manage pension fund risks by diversifying the investments of plan assets and by (partially) matching interest rate risk of liabilities.\n\nSignify has an active de-risking strategy in which it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its defined-benefit plans.\n\n## 25 Post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment benefits covered in this note relate to defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, including defined-benefit retiree medical plans. The benefits provided by these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation levels. Employee post-employment defined-benefit plans have been established in several countries in accordance with the legal requirements, customs and local practice.\n\n## Net defined-benefit liabilities per country\n\n|                 |                |              |                 |            | 2020         | 2020            |\n|-----------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|\n|                 | Obligation 236 | Plan  assets | Net   Liability | Obligation | Plan  assets | Net   Liability |\n| Germany         |                | (15)         | 221             | 227        | (15)         | 212             |\n| Unites States   | 625            | (505)        | 120             | 579        | (485)        | 94              |\n| Other countries | 166            | (70)         | 96              | 153        | (69)         | 84              |\n| Total countries | 1,027          | (590)        | 437             | 959        | (569)        | 390             |\n\n## United States\n\nThe defined-benefit Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan in the US covers certain hourly workers and salaried workers hired before January 1, 2005. The plan is closed for new entrants and since 2016 no further benefit accruals are taking place. Employees only accrue benefits in a defined-contribution plan. Signify pays the administration cost and contributions to cover the funding deficit of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan. The plan assets are governed by an Investment Committee. Signify also has an unfunded pension plan in place for higher salaried employees and a post-retirement welfare plan.\n\nSignify reviewed the funding level of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan and decided that it would not make a contribution in 2020. Signify expects in 2021 cash outflows in relation to the defined-benefit plans of EUR 7 million.\n\nFor the funding of the deficit of the US Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan, Signify adheres to the minimum funding requirements of the US Pension Protection Act.",

The impact on the defined-benefit obligation of changes in discount rate is for funded plans normally accompanied by offsetting movements in plan assets, especially when using matching strategies.\n\n|                                         | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Increase                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | (95)   | (88)   |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | 7      | 7      |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | 24     | 22     |\n| Longevity (see explanation)             | 36     | 32     |\n| Healthcare cost change (1% movement)    | 9      | 6      |\n| Decrease                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | 110    | 102    |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | (7)    | (6)    |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | (22)   | (20)   |\n\nLongevity also impacts the post-employment defined-benefit obligation. In the above sensitivity table, the impact on the defined-benefit obligation of a further 10% decrease in the assumed rates of mortality for Signify's major schemes is illustrated. A 10% decrease in assumed mortality rates equals improvement of life expectancy by six months to a year.\n\n## 26 Related party transactions\n\nSignify considers the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to be key management personnel as defined in IAS 24 'Related parties'. For remuneration details of Key Management, see note 28, Information on remuneration.\n\n## Plan assets allocation\n\nThe asset allocation in Signify's pension plans at December 31 was as follows:\n\n| In millions of EUR   |   2019 |   2020 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Debt securities      |    401 |    408 |\n| Equity securities    |     97 |     68 |\n| Other                |     92 |     93 |\n| Total assets         |    590 |    569 |\n\nThe assets in 2020 contained 15% unquoted assets. Plan assets in 2020 do not include property occupied by or financial instruments issued by Signify.\n\nSome 85% of the total plan assets of the Signify pension plan are in the US and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio. The interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio of the US qualified pension plan is closely aligned to that of the plan's pension liabilities. The remaining 15% of the total plan assets is mainly the market value of insured pension benefits.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThe mortality tables used for Signify's major schemes are:\n\n- \u00b7 US: Base table PRI-2012 White Collar mortality table, projected forward with future mortality improvements according to Scale MP-2020.\n- \u00b7 Germany: Richttafeln 2018 G K. Heubeck.\n\nThe weighted averages of the assumptions used to calculate the defined-benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n\n| In %                      |   2019 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate             |    2.6 |    1.9 |\n| Pension cost increases    |    0.4 |    0.4 |\n| Healthcare cost increases |    0.5 |    0.4 |\n| Wage increases            |    0.5 |    0.4 |\n\nThe average duration of the defined-benefit obligation of the defined-benefit plans is 10.1 years. For the defined-benefit plans in the US and Germany, the average duration is respectively 10.2 years and 9.2 years. The average discount rates for the plans in these countries are respectively 2.2% and 0.4%. The pension cost increase rate assumption for the German defined-benefit plans is 1.6%.",

The closing share price at grant date is adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, as participants are not compensated for Signify dividend payouts. Monte Carlo simulation takes into account market conditions expected to impact relative Total Shareholders' Return performance in relation to selected peers and the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\n## Assumptions used in Monte-Carlo simulation for valuation in %\n\n|                                 | 2020      |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|\n| Risk-free interest rate         | ( 0.7 ) % |\n| Expected share price volatility | 38 %      |\n\nThe assumptions were used for these calculations only and do not necessarily represent an indication of Signify management's expectation of future developments for other purposes. Historic volatility was measured over the same timeframe as the simulation period (weighted average 2.6 years).\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for TSR shares is not adjusted for actual performance.\n\nFCF, Sustainability, and ROCE related measurements are non-market performance conditions. Fair value of shares granted under FCF, Sustainability, and ROCE objective conditions equals the closing share price on the grant date, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for shares granted with a non-market performance condition is adjusted for actual performance.\n\n## 27 Share-based compensation\n\n## Signify Long-term Incentive Plan\n\nUnder the Signify Long-term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan), which is equity settled, eligible employees are granted both conditional shares and performance shares. Conditional shares have a three-year cliff vesting period and will vest if a grantee is still employed with Signify at the vesting date.\n\nVesting of performance shares is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of three years. The performance condition measurement is based on three measures for the 2018 and 2019 LTI Plans and four measures for the 2020 LTI Plan, For details refer to the following table:\n\n## Relative share of performance shares per LTI plan in %\n\n| Types of performance shares   | LTI 2018   | LTI 2019   |   LTI 2020 |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Total shareholder return      | 40         | 40         |         25 |\n| Free cash flow                | 40         | 40         |         25 |\n| Sustainability                | 20         | 20         |         25 |\n| Return on Capital Employed    |            |            |         25 |\n| Total                         | 100        | 100        |        100 |\n\nFor the Board of Management and certain members of senior management, the LTI Plan consists of performance shares only. Shares are conditionally granted annually.\n\nIn addition to shares awarded under the Signify LTI Plan, Signify may in individual cases, such as in the hiring process of members of (senior-) management, also grant restricted shares. Restricted shares have either three-year cliff vesting period or vest gradually over the vesting period of one, two or three years.\n\nUnder the terms of the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), employees are eligible to purchase a limited number of Signify shares at discounted prices through payroll withholdings.",

As of December 31, 2020, Signify had a ratio of fixed-rate debt to total outstanding debt of approximately 65% (2019: 17%).\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted in January 2021 shows that if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by 1% from their level of December 31, 2020, with all other variables held constant, the annualized net interest expense would decrease by EUR 3 million. This impact was based on the outstanding net floating debt position as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Details on the COVID-19 impact are disclosed in note 1, Basis of preparation.\n\nLiquidity risk for Signify is monitored through the Treasury Risk Committee which tracks the development of the actual cash flow position and uses input from a number of sources in order to forecast the overall liquidity position.\n\nThe table below analyzes Signify's financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant. Interest on Long-term debt is based on floating rate adjustments according to market expectations.\n\n|                                 |       | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   | Payments due by period   |\n|---------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                 | Total | Less than  1 year        | Between  1 and 5  years  | Over  5 years            |\n| Debt, including bank overdrafts | 2,075 | 19                       | 1,460                    | 596                      |\n| Interest on debt                | 162   | 34                       | 108                      | 20                       |\n| Trade and other payables        | 1,731 | 1,731                    |                          |                          |\n| Lease liability                 | 233   | 69                       | 132                      | 32                       |\n| Derivative liabilities          | 45    | 44                       | 1                        |                          |\n| Off-balance sheet commitments   | 159   | 31                       | 125                      | 3                        |\n| Purchase obligations            | 93    | 35                       | 58                       |                          |\n| Contractual cash obligations    | 4,498 | 1,963                    | 1,884                    | 651                      |\n| Revolving credit facility (RCF) | 500   |                          |                          |                          |\n\nSignify invests surplus cash primarily in money market deposits with investment graded financial institutions, and with maturities up to three months, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet liabilities when due.\n\nThe estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by Signify using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will ultimately be realized by Signify upon maturity or disposal. The use of market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\nThe following hierarchy is applied to classify the financial assets and liabilities:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInstruments included in Level 1 are comprised primarily of listed Eurobonds classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Level 2\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. Please refer to note 2, Significant accounting policies, for further details.\n\n## Level 3\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuating because of changes in the market interest rates. Financial instruments included in the debt position create an inherent interest rate risk. Failure to effectively hedge this risk could negatively impact financial results.\n\nSignify monitors interest rate coverage, short-term and long-term interest rate developments and has the flexibility to opt for different short-term interest periods for the variable debt instruments at roll-over dates and/or could enter into derivative financial",

However, not every foreign currency can or shall be hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost preventing Signify from effectively and/or efficiently hedging its currency exposures. As a result, hedging activities cannot and will not eliminate all currency risks for anticipated and committed transaction exposures.\n\nThe following table outlines the estimated nominal value in millions of EUR for transaction exposure and related hedges for Signify's most significant currency exposures:\n\n|                           | Receivables / Sales   | Receivables / Sales   | Payables / Purchases   | Payables / Purchases   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                           | Exposure              | Hedges                | Exposure               | Hedges                 |\n| Balance as at December 31 |                       |                       |                        |                        |\n| Exposure currency         |                       |                       |                        |                        |\n| CNY                       | 80                    | (65)                  | ( 1,185)               | 678                    |\n| USD                       | 1,001                 | (606)                 | (186)                  | 154                    |\n| GBP                       | 124                   | (68)                  | (13)                   | 9                      |\n| EUR  1                    | 121                   | (121)                 | (14)                   | 14                     |\n| CAD                       | 97                    | (57)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| SEK                       | 79                    | (40)                  | (1)                    | -                      |\n| CHF                       | 61                    | (34)                  | (3)                    | 3                      |\n| AUD                       | 58                    | (32)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| NOK                       | 45                    | (21)                  | (1)                    | 1                      |\n| SGD                       | 43                    | (22)                  | (4)                    | 3                      |\n| NZD                       | 42                    | (23)                  | (10)                   | 6                      |\n| RON                       | 28                    | (14)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| CZK                       | 22                    | (11)                  | -                      | -                      |\n| PLN                       | 48                    | (48)                  | (32)                   | 32                     |\n| Others                    | 16                    | (16)                  | (21)                   | 21                     |\n| Total 2020                | 1,866                 | (1,177)               | (1,471)                | 920                    |\n| Total 2019                | 986                   | (685)                 | ( 1,901)               | 1,258                  |\n\n- 1 EUR exposures in non EUR donominated functional currencies.\n\nSignify has various sources to mitigate liquidity risk. Signify pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically feasible; cash not pooled remains available for operational or investment needs. The table below shows details of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts as of the reporting date:\n\n|                                               | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at banks and in hand                     | 423    | 315    |\n| Short-term deposits                           | 394    | 700    |\n| Other cash equivalents                        | 30     | 17     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 847    | 1,033  |\n| Bank overdrafts                               | (7)    | (3)    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts | 840    | 1,030  |\n\nSignify has a EUR 500 million revolving credit facility that can be used for general purposes. As of December 31, 2020, Signify did not have any amounts drawn under either facility.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk is the risk that reported financial performance, or the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument, will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Signify operates in many countries and currencies and therefore currency fluctuations may inevitably impact its financial results. Signify is exposed to currency risk in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction exposures related to anticipated sales and purchases and on-balance-sheet receivables/payables resulting from such transactions.\n- \u00b7 Financing exposure arising from foreign currency intercompany and external debt and deposits.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of net income in foreign entities.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of foreign currency denominated equity invested in consolidated companies.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure to equity interests in non-functional-currency investments in associates and financial assets at fair value.\n\nIt is Signify's policy to reduce the volatility caused by foreign currency movements on its net earnings by hedging the anticipated net exposure of foreign currencies resulting from foreign currency sales and purchases. In general, net anticipated exposures are hedged during a period of 15 months in layers of 20% up to a hedge ratio of 80%, using derivatives.",

Signify could hedge certain commodity price risks using derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2020, Signify had EUR nil million of commodity derivatives recognized in the Statement of financial position (2019: EUR 2 million).\n\nChange of the commodity price for 10% will lead to the commodity derivatives value change of EUR 5 million (2019: EUR 5 million).\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date, if counterparties failed completely to perform their payment obligations as contracted. Credit risk is present within Signify trade and other receivables and contract assets. To have better insights into the credit exposures, Signify performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its customers and adjusts credit limits when appropriate. In instances where the creditworthiness of a customer is determined not to be sufficient to grant the credit limit required, there are a number of mitigation tools that can be utilized to close the gap, including reducing payment terms, cash on delivery, prepayments and pledges on assets.\n\nSignify invests available cash and cash equivalents and enters into financial derivative instruments with various financial institutions and is exposed to credit risk with these counterparties. Signify does not enter into any financial derivative instruments to protect against default by financial institutions.\n\nWhere possible, Signify requires all financial institutions to complete legally enforceable netting agreements under an International Swap Dealers Association master agreement or otherwise prior to trading, and whenever possible, to have a solid credit rating from generally accepted rating agencies. Signify also regularly monitors the development of the credit risk of its financial counterparties.\n\nSignify minimizes this risk by limiting the deposits made with any single bank and by making deposits, the majority of which is with banks that have strong credit ratings.\n\nMaximum credit risk exposure for Signify equals carrying amounts of all financial assets recognized in the Statement of financial position plus off-balance sheet guarantees provided.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, a gain of EUR 22 million was deferred in equity as a result of these hedges (2019: loss of EUR 8 million). The result deferred in equity will be released to earnings mostly during 2021 at the time when the related hedged transaction affects the Consolidated statement of income. During 2020, EUR nil million (2019: EUR nil million) was recorded within cost of goods sold in the Consolidated statement of income as a result of ineffectiveness on certain anticipated cash flow hedges.\n\nThe total net fair value of hedges related to transaction exposure as of December 31, 2020 was an unrealized asset of EUR 23 million (2019: liability EUR 5 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to an increase of EUR 2 million in the value of the derivatives. This increase includes a loss of EUR 12 million that would impact the income statement, which would largely offset the opposite revaluation effect on the underlying accounts receivable and payable, and the remaining gain of EUR 14 million would be recognized in equity to the extent that the cash flow hedges were effective.\n\nForeign exchange exposure also arises from intercompany loans and deposits. Where Signify enters into such arrangements the financing is generally provided in the functional currency of the subsidiary. The currency of Signify's external funding and liquid assets is matched with the required financing of subsidiaries either directly through external foreign currency loans and deposits or synthetically by using foreign exchange derivatives. In certain cases, where Signify subsidiaries may also have external foreign currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also hedged using foreign exchange derivatives. The fair value of these hedges as of December 31, 2020 was an unrealized asset of EUR 2 million (2019: asset of EUR 1 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to a decrease of EUR 46 million in the value of the derivatives.\n\nIn 2020, Signify started to hedge part of its investment in one of its foreign subsidiaries which includes Cooper Lighting by entering into foreign currency forward contracts of nominal amount of USD 503 million. This hedge mitigates foreign currency translation risk arising from the net assets of the subsidiary. This hedge was fully effective, as such there was no ineffectiveness recognized in profit and loss in 2020. As at 31 December 2020 the market value of these forward contracts was an asset of EUR 52 million. A 10% increase in the value of the EUR against USD would lead to an increase of EUR 37 million in the fair value of derivatives that end up in the Currency translation differences within Equity.",

The country risk per country is defined as the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and associated companies in country cross-border transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts receivable from third parties and intercompany accounts receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Signify had country risk exposure of EUR 2.4 billion in the United States, EUR 1.2 billion in the Netherlands and EUR 562 million in Belgium. Countries where the risk exceeds EUR 200 million but was less than EUR 500 million are China including Hong Kong (EUR 483 million), Poland (EUR 444 million), and Saudi Arabia (EUR 201 million). Countries where the risk exceeded EUR 50 million but was less than EUR 200 million are Mexico, Spain, Canada, Singapore, France, India and Australia. The degree of risk of a country is taken into account when new investments are considered. Signify does not, however, use financial derivative instruments to hedge country risk, except for the net investment hedge as described above.\n\n## 30 Events after the balance sheet date\n\nIn January 2021, Signify extended the maturity of the committed EUR 500 million multicurrency revolving credit facility (RCF) for one year (till January 2026). Originally, the facility had a maturity of five years (January 2025) with the option to extend it twice by one year at the end of the first and second anniversary. The other conditions of the term and revolving credit facility remained unchanged.\n\nIn January 2021, Signify communicated a further plan that aims to enhance its competitiveness by optimizing the cost base, making the central organization leaner and improving the performance culture. These changes are enabled by a revised organizational structure and will lead to a reduction of approximately 600 positions globally (representing 2% of total Signify workforce), of which approximately 250 positions will be in the Netherlands (representing 10% of the Dutch workforce). These organizational changes are currently subject to works council proceedings.\n\nNo other subsequent events occurred that are material to Signify.",

For the remuneration of past and present members of both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, refer to note 28, Information on remuneration of this Annual Report, which is deemed incorporated and repeated herein by reference.\n\n## G Contingent liabilities not appearing in the balance sheet\n\nGeneral guarantees as referred to in Section 403, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code, have been given by the Company on behalf of other group companies in the Netherlands. The liabilities of these companies to third parties amounted to EUR 452 million as at December 31, 2020, (2019: EUR 1,211 million).\n\n## Limitations in the distribution of shareholders' equity\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, pursuant to Dutch law, certain limitations existed relating to the distribution of shareholders' equity of EUR 176 million. Such limitations relate to ordinary shares of EUR 1 million, legal reserves required by Dutch law of EUR 154 million, other reserves of EUR 3 million and unrealized gains related to cash flow hedges of EUR 17 million.

The unrealized losses related to cash flow hedges of EUR 7 million, although qualifying as a legal reserve, reduce the distributable amount by their nature.\n\n## E Debt\n\n## New term loan structure and a revolving credit facility\n\nIn January 2020, the Company refinanced the term loans held by its subsidiaries of EUR 740 million and USD 500 million maturing in May 2021, with a new term loan structure consisting of EUR 400 million and USD 275 million maturing in January 2023 and EUR 340 million and USD 225 million maturing in January 2025. At the same time, the revolving credit facility (RCF) of EUR 500 million was refinanced for the same amount with a five-year maturity plus two one-year extension options. The term loans and RCF agreement include a financial covenant providing that Signify maintains a net leverage ratio of no greater than 3.5x. The net leverage ratio may temporarily increase to 4.0x within 12 months of the closing of the Cooper Lighting acquisition or other material acquisitions. The covenant does not apply if Signify has at least one investment grade rating, which is currently the case, as Signify has two investment grade ratings.\n\nThe new term loan structure bears interest at a variable rate based on the relevant applicable EURIBOR and USD LIBOR respectively with zero floor plus a margin. As at December 31, 2020, the margin was 0.65% for the term loans maturing in January 2023 and 0.75% for the term loans maturing in January 2025, and is subject to change depending on the public credit rating of Signify assigned by rating agencies.",

The vertical axis captures the importance of each topic for external and internal stakeholders. The horizontal axis captures our company's significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, both positive and negative. Assessing both aspects enables us to prioritize and focus on the most relevant issues in terms of our efforts as well as reporting progress in this Annual Report. Our materiality assessment was conducted using the GRI Standards' principles for defining report content.\n\n## Continuous stakeholder engagement\n\nThrough dialogue with key stakeholders, we have gained significant insights into how to create value and anticipate risks.

These include media and trend analyses as well as continuous conversations with strategic stakeholders. To prioritize these topics, Signify organizes dedicated stakeholder engagement activities every year. In 2020, instead of an in-person meeting, this consisted of an online survey reaching out to 425 internal and external stakeholders (response rate of 25%) and internal strategic discussions.\n\nAs an outcome of the assessment, Energy efficiency, Human rights and Carbon footprint are our most material topics.

We also used additional company disclosures.\n\nAn overview of the information on data definitions, measurements and any uncertainties inherent to measurements can be found in the Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report, available on our Sustainability downloads webpage: https:// www.signify.com/global/sustainability/ downloads. These supplements also include more information on our 2020 materiality assessment, a GRI Content Index presenting the overview of the GRI disclosures, a mapping to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and to the E.U. Directive on non-financial information.\n\nNew Signify ventures and acquisitions are included in environmental and social disclosures to the extent that the integration process of these ventures has been finalized. The normative integration period is two years. Divestures completed before December 31 of the book-year are excluded from environmental and social reporting.\n\nIn 2020, Signify re-committed to the United Nations Global Compact to advance 10 universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anticorruption efforts. This report also serves as our annual Communication on Progress (COP) towards abiding by these principles.\n\n## 16.1.2 Sustainability governance\n\nThe Sustainability function, including Environment, Health & Safety, headed by Nicola Kimm, consists of global, regional and local sustainability professionals and falls under the responsibility of the Board of Management member and Chief Strategy & Marketing Officer, Maria Letizia Mariani. Progress is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Board of Management and the Leadership Team. During these meetings, progress on strategic programs is reviewed and corrective actions are taken when necessary.\n\nProgress is also reviewed with the Supervisory Board on an annual basis. In addition, the results of our sustainability programs are communicated on a quarterly basis to Signify employees and on our website to external stakeholders.\n\nSustainability programs are embedded in the Signify organization and ways of working. Examples of departments that implement sustainability programs include sales, innovation, manufacturing, sourcing, and logistics. Targets on sustainability are set both at a corporate level and at a division level.\n\n## 16.1.3 Program targets\n\nOur sustainability commitments are grouped under our sustainability program Brighter Lives, Better World, launched in September 2016. Targets for this program were set for a five-year period, until the end of 2020. Changes in targets, policies, definitions or scope are specified annually. There are no changes in targets, policies, definitions or scope to be reported in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure our efforts are in line with the targets of the Paris Agreement, we have set Science-Based Targets in relation to our emissions. For more details, please refer to sub-section 16.4.2 Carbon footprint and energy.\n\nSignify has a target of reaching 5 million lives with renewably powered lighting and supporting 10,000 people with technical and business skills development in 2020 (baseline 2017). For more details, please refer to sub-section 16.3.5 Social impact of light.\n\nIn 2020, we embarked on a new five-year journey to double our positive impact on the environment and society.

We are investing in our people's growth and development, creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, and reskilling to enhance our digital and commercial competencies. With our company purpose and values, we provide our people with a common direction about why we exist, what we value, and how we work.\n\nAt Signify, we put the Customer First. We will always be Greater Together by collaborating across teams to build on our strengths and diversity, and work towards our shared goal. We are a Game Changer, innovating to set ourselves apart and continue to lead in the industry. We have Passion for Results by working smarter and faster to deliver with excellence.\n\n## 16.2  Sustainable Innovation\n\nInnovation is an important pillar of Signify's purpose: to unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world. Our sustainable products and systems must demonstrate proven measurable benefits in one or more of the eight sustainable focal areas (SFAs) compared to the relevant, regularly updated benchmark.\n\nWe have five Better World SFAs:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy - increasing energy efficiency of products, systems and services\n- \u00b7 Packaging - reducing packaging weight / volume, increasing recycled content and eliminating the use of plastics\n- \u00b7 Substances - eliminating harmful substances\n- \u00b7 Weight & material s - reducing product weight and selecting sustainable materials\n- \u00b7 Circularity - avoiding waste and optimally preserving value\n\nAnd three Brighter Lives SFAs:\n\n- \u00b7 Access to light - providing light in off-grid and underserved areas\n- \u00b7 Food availability - providing light that increases productivity of food by \u226510% vs benchmark\n- \u00b7 Human-centric lighting - providing light which increases wellbeing and performance\n\nOur sustainable innovations continue to revolutionize the lighting industry. In 2020, we invested EUR 244 million in sustainable innovation which represents 85.1% of Signify R&D expenses (83.5% in 2019). Increasing investments in digital lighting solutions, cloud computing and circular economy designs have led to further improvements in the areas of energy and circularity. At the same time, sustainable innovation also addresses social needs such as Access to light, Food availability and Human centric lighting. We believe that sustainable innovation will help create a more futureproof and purposeful portfolio of products, systems and services.\n\n## Sustainable innovation in millions of EUR\n\n300\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 includes Cooper Lighting and KLite.\n\n## 16.3  Brighter Lives\n\n## 16.3.1 Human capital\n\ndevelopment\n\nMark van Bijsterveld, Chief HR Officer Signify\n\n'To continue our transformation into the new age of connected lighting, we need the industry's very best people. That's why at Signify we focus on developing all our employees and selectively attracting new, diverse talent. Creating a workplace where people belong, have impact and take pride in the company is at the heart of our people strategy. We celebrate our successes, learn from our failures, and work in a style of radical collaboration to continuously improve. Our diversity initiatives and inclusive environment facilitates continuous performance and learning. I'm proud to be part of this remarkable team and how together we have ensured business continuity and performance in 2020. This was a year like no other with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting all aspects of our lives. Our company quickly adapted to this new reality in the way we work, making sure our employee's health and safety came first and all together ensuring we continued to serve our customers. The solidarity shown by our employees during this challenging year makes me proud to work for Signify and truly showed we are greater together.'",

In 2020, a special focus was put on the target groups of marketing and sales with relevant messaging customized per region and reflecting our EVP.\n\nAs part of our global talent acquisition strategy, we continue to attract talent from proven high quality sources. In 2020, the main sources of hire were:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal - Over the last few years we have filled approximately 30% of our vacancies internally.\n- \u00b7 Employee referral -13% of our new hires came from employee referrals.\n- \u00b7 Sourcing - Our recruiters focus on proactively building talent pipelines and identifying talent, supported by recruitment marketing campaigns to increase awareness and drive conversion for-hard-to-fill roles.\n- \u00b7 Signify careers website - Via our content strategy on social media \"Humanizing our employer brand\", employees shared why Signify is a great place to work, in alignment with our values and EVP and enabled us to outperform competition. In 2020, 68% of the hires that used LinkedIn to explore and discover opportunities at Signify were influenced by our content.\n\nThe Signify global career website can be found at www.careers.signify.com.\n\n## Employment\n\nThe total number of Signify employees was 37,926 at the end of 2020, compared to 32,005 at year-end 2019. This number includes our newly acquired companies Cooper Lighting and Klite. The data further provided in this section excludes employees from these acquisitions (representing a third of the total workforce), as integration in our human resources system has not yet been fully completed.\n\nApproximately 24% of our employees were employed by one of our three divisions, focusing on research & product development. 20% were employed in one of our markets, focusing on sales & marketing. 46% of our employees were in operations, focusing on manufacturing, supply chain and procurement. The remaining 10% worked in corporate functions.\n\nIn line with the industry transformation from conventional to LED technologies and connected lighting systems and services, we expect that the nature of the current workforce will continue to evolve.\n\n## Employees in FTEs\n\n|               | 2018           | 2019   | 2020   |\n|---------------|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Signify total | 29,237  32,005 |        | 37,926 |\n\nIn 2020, the total employee turnover was close to 32%, which is 9% less than last year.

We believe that we will maintain our position as the market leader in lighting by being a talent-builder, developing and growing people from within. We want our employees to have a challenging and rewarding work experience. One where they can grow and make an impact, where they gain new experiences and develop themselves. We do this by offering employees attractive and relevant learning and career development opportunities and by strengthening the leadership and diversity pipeline across the organization.\n\nIn 2020, we launched our new internal career website. This easy-to-use platform offers a place to search for vacancies, find stretch assignments, read inspirational career journey stories and follow learning paths - all in the service of pushing the boundaries of people development. After its implementation, we saw a 36% increase in internal applications. We also introduced our Global Mentoring Platform which enables employees to develop themselves by exchanging experiences and knowledge whilst broadening their professional network within the company. To reach our\n\ncommitment of doubling the percentage of women in leadership to 34% by 2025, we are putting specific emphasis on women in succession plans and our EDGE leadership programs, in addition to launching sponsorship and mentoring programs for female talent and the Women4More career program.\n\nOur approach to talent is to continuously build and develop employees' functional and leadership skills, whilst attracting new, diverse talent where critical capabilities are needed to strengthen our talent pool to achieve our strategic objectives. In 2020, we welcomed 6,084 external talents to help bring our business vision to life, most of whom were employed in manufacturing and sales functions.\n\nIn line with our people philosophy to promote talent from within the organization, 83% of our senior management and leadership roles were filled internally.\n\n## A strong global employer brand with local relevance in the digital age\n\nIn October 2020, we launched our refreshed Employer Value Proposition (EVP): Shine Brighter at Signify - together we unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world. The sustainability proposition is aligned with our Signify 2025",

Some recent examples include the creation of a Diversity Equity and Inclusion Committee in the US, a 12-week online Gender Awareness program in the UK & Ireland and a series of Diversity and inclusion dialogues to understand cultural differences in Greater China.\n\nIn 2020, our Diversity and inclusion Champions network grew to around 60 members, welcoming colleagues from Cooper Lighting, who continue to drive actions locally and share best practices. Our Diversity and inclusion Board, created in 2019, continues to structure and advance our strategy and we extended our offer of diversity and inclusion online learning pathways to include, amongst others, an introduction to unconscious bias.\n\nFostering an inclusive culture and feeling of belonging, where people take pride in the company we are building together, remains key. Globally, we recognize the need for more diverse representation in the areas of gender and generation and we continually monitor related data to support our aim of reaching greater diversity representation in our organization. Over the past three years we have maintained representation from different generations in our workforce. We plan to further improve our generational diversity in the future by increasing the inflow of early career talents.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\n'Be a great place to work' is one of our 5 strategic frontiers, and employee engagement is key to our competitive performance and integral to our people vision: creating a workplace where people belong, have impact and take pride in the company we build together. Engaged employees are emotionally committed to our company. They help us to meet our business goals and sustainability commitments, whilst contributing to a dynamic, highperformance workplace. In 2020, to foster employee engagement on sustainability, we continued our quarterly campaigns around the themes of safety at work to prioritize employees' health during the COVID-19 pandemic, zero waste and carbon neutrality with our carbon neutral Cookalong challenge.\n\nGiven that employee feedback and engagement is so critical, seven years ago we introduced a quarterly survey currently known as the Team survey, with the accompanying promotion of Team dialogues for people managers and their teams. This Team survey has questions in line with our company purpose and values and it proved to be a positive driver of employee engagement to increase team effectiveness. As a result, we will continue to run the Team survey on a quarterly basis to monitor engagement.\n\nThis year, we introduced a Team survey platform for managers to view their survey results in a dynamic dashboard. They can easily monitor the response rate and the history for their team(s). Furthermore,\n\nthe platform gives managers access to an action planning tool where they can list their priority questions and consult a library of action tips to prepare for their Team dialogues.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the following company results: 88% of our employees underlined that we truly put our Customer First (2019: 86%); 89% of our employees acknowledged that we are Greater Together (2019: 87.3%); 90% of our employees felt that we are considered a Game Changer (2019: 88%) and 81% of our employees agreed that we have Passion for Results (2019: 79.3%).\n\nWe noted that we need to continue improving in the areas of effectiveness and recognition. Initiatives to address our improvement points are driven at a team level via our Team dialogues, and in addition we continue to track progress on these questions during our Quarterly Performance Reviews.\n\nTo measure employee satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology is used as part of our Team survey. Employees are asked to rank how likely it is that they would recommend our company as a great place to work. In 2020, the Team survey had an average employee response rate of 83% which is the highest since we began running the survey (2019: 80%). At the end of Q3 and Q4 2020, we recorded an unprecedented NPS score of 29 across the Signify population, leading to an average annual score of 25 (2019: 18). While employees had to face challenging new ways of working due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company safeguarded employee's health and took\n\nmultiple actions to enable employees to stay connected, which translated into a strong employee NPS.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nAt Signify, we believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment are essential to a thriving innovative business and long-term value creation. We are an equal opportunity employer committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. This means we celebrate and foster an environment in which all ideas, perspectives, experiences and styles are highly valued and where all individuals are treated fairly with equal access to opportunities and resources. Diverse representation in our workforce is critical for our long-term success as a company. It enables us to understand, connect and communicate with our customers, end-users and stakeholders whilst helping us to attract and retain people who want to be part of our purpose to create brighter lives and a better world. Our Diversity and inclusion strategy reinforces our Greater Together value which enables us to make better decisions, boost innovation, create growth and strengthen our culture.\n\nIn 2020, we anchored diversity and inclusion in our company strategy with our commitment to create a great place to work. We also took the opportunity to review and update our approach to diversity and inclusion in light of the many global societal shifts, reinforcing our existing '2+1' approach i.e. global focus on 2 specific diversity dimensions with space for markets,",

In 2020, 49% of our new hires were women, a similar percentage to last year (2019: 48%).\n\nFrom a generational perspective, 29% of employees were 35 years old or under. The average age of our workforce is 41 years old and we have the ambition to lower it over the next few years by attracting and retaining early talents.\n\nAs a company, we are naturally diverse operating in 74 countries with more than 90 nationalities represented in our workforce.\n\nWe're committed to hiring more diverse talent for jobs at all levels, attracting candidates from more diverse pipelines and driving development and internal mobility to\n\nincrease representation across our company. Globally we recognize that we have not advanced in being truly more diverse in our workforce, especially in management and executive positions, therefore we intensified our focus this year on increasing the representation of women and early career talents in our company.\n\nAs part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 commitments to double our positive impact on the environment and society, we will strengthen our commitment to diversity and inclusion and aim to double the percentage of women in leadership in our business to 34% by the end of 2025.\n\n## Equal remuneration\n\nSignify' s commitment to equity and inclusion includes a policy for equal pay for equal, or substantially similar, work. Signify establishes formal pay policies and practices that govern hiring, benefit entitlements,\n\nannual merit, and promotional guidelines to ensure equity. Further, Signify performs regular reviews which are designed to ensure compliance with our policy of equal pay for equal work and all local legal requirements in the countries in which we operate.Our regular review process includes a comprehensive statistical analysis of pay to employees across the world. Any statistically significant variance within any employee group is promptly addressed.\n\n## Leadership and Development\n\nAt Signify, we are committed to learning and consider continuous learning and development to be a key differentiator in enriching the lives and careers of our employees, enabling growth, engagement, and fulfillment. We offer new approaches to learning and apply them daily. A clear demonstration of our learning culture was the introduction of our social learning",

More than 415,720 e-learnings were booked centrally compared to 384,000 in 2019 and 210,000 in 2018.\n\nBased on our value creation methodology, Signify has created EUR 3.24 million in value for our society through its employees' learning and development programs.\n\n## Leadership development\n\nLinked to the people pillar of our 5 Frontiers strategy - be a great place to work - we continue to ensure that our leadership development experiences are aligned to this and to our talent philosophy. For 2020, given the necessity to adjust to the travel limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we re-designed our EDGE I leadership development experience to a completely virtual 12-week program. The EDGE I program built on the partnership we have with Ashridge HULT. This ensured that our first-time leaders continued to get support in their roles and that we continue to build a pipeline of future-ready leaders who can further take the company to paths of excellence and sustainable growth.\n\nIn 2020, the program added a 360-degree feedback as a foundational part of the experience, as well as introducing 1-on-1 peer coaching, self-directed virtual learning, group activities focused on\n\ninclusive leadership, innovation and sustainability, all linked with a pre/post call, Action Learning Sets and a Certificate of Application to measure the learning effect. In 2020, we completed 3 EDGE I leadership programs, with each class of around 30 participants.\n\nAs we move into 2021, we will continue to improve the leadership development experiences focusing on virtual EDGE II and EDGE III experiences for more senior leaders. We will also look to further enhance our People Manager and Leadership Principles learning tracks, ensuring that our leaders are equipped to lead, develop and inspire our people.\n\n## Let's Get Systemized!\n\nIn 2020, we continued to work on commercial excellence, upskilling our sales talents in markets to increase the opportunity win-rates in a highly competitive business context. Over 50 subject matter experts joined the movement and created agile learning content in their respective fields of expertise, such as Interact, Dynalite and Color Kinetics, making use of the full potential of the Learning@Signify platform.\n\nThe design reflects our blended learning vision - allowing people to not only discover the latest content on the value propositions via reading or watching videos, but also stimulating them to take part in the dialogue and meet virtually on a regular basis to discuss challenges and learn from peers. Markets embraced this opportunity to learn and connect with experts and peers and were encouraged to get the needed 'license to sell' within their sub-segment.\n\nWith close to 5,000 active learners and over 1,000 people actively engaging with each other in our 'System Talks', Signify employees are taking ownership of their learning. The program proves that we have a wealth of knowledge inside our company and strengthens our muscle to increase our market share in the System and Services business.\n\n## Reskilling for digital excellence\n\nDigitalization is an essential part of our 5 Frontiers strategy and it is equally becoming a necessity to remain relevant and keep pace with the changing nature of work. To enable this, we want our employees to have an opportunity to invest in themselves by learning new concepts and skills, to equip them for the future. We are accelerating our online learning investments to support all our employees and build organizational resilience.\n\nIn 2020, we initiated several programs for reskilling which are designed around critical digital competencies such as: Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Data & Analytics (AI / Machine Learning / Data Analytics), Cloud Computing, Information & Cyber security, AGILE (SAFe & SCRUM), eCommerce, critical thinking, adaptability and collaboration.\n\nThrough the award-winning Harvard Manage Mentor leadership suite, employees also have access to over 40 individual online modules on personal development, business and management skills, and additional Leadership content via Harvard's SPARK package.",

Respecting human rights is a central foundation of the way we work. Our commitment to respecting and promoting human rights extends beyond our own operations, across our wider sphere of influence, including our supply chain. To that end, we integrate human rights considerations into our policies, processes, and practices.\n\nOur Human Rights policy is based on the International Bill of Human Rights, the United Nations Global Compact Ten Principles, and the International Labour Organization's declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work. Signify carries out continuous research and stakeholder engagement activities to identify the most salient ethical and social principles that govern our relationship with stakeholders worldwide.\n\nThe table on the right shows, in random order, the salient issues identified and the stakeholders they affect, as well as references to the sub-sections of this report that contain the progress that Signify made in addressing these issues.\n\nC\n\nCreating value\n\nCorporate performance\n\nWe are Signify\n\n## Salient human rights issues\n\n|    | Salient human rights issues                       | Rights holders covered in our programs   | Rights holders covered in our programs   |                    | Reference to our disclosures                                                                     |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  1 | Freedom of association and collective  bargaining | (3rd party) employees \u00b7                  | Direct suppliers \u00b7                       | Indirect suppliers | 16.3.4: Acting with integrity  16.3.2:  Social responsibility in our supply  chain               |\n|  2 | Safe & healthy workplace                          | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        |                    | 16.3.3: Safety at work 16.3.2:  Social responsibility in our supply  chain                       |\n|  3 | Working hours                                     | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        |                    | 16.3.4: Acting with integrity  16.3.2:  Social responsibility in our supply  chain               |\n|  4 | Equal employment opportunities and  respect       | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        |                    | 16.3.1: Diversity and inclusion 16.3.2:  Social responsibility in our supply  chain              |\n|  5 | Recognition and reward                            | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        |                    | 16.3.2: Human rights 16.3.4: Acting with integrity  16.3.2:  Social responsibility in our supply |\n|  6 | Forced and child labor                            |                                          | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                  | chain 16.3.2:  Social responsibility in our supply                                               |\n|  7 | Employee development                              | \u00b7                                        |                                          |                    | chain 16.3.1: Leadership and Development                                                         |\n\n## Human rights risk assessment\n\nCompliance to the Human Rights policy is governed through our Integrity code processes, combined with dedicated steps that help ensure adherence.\n\nIn 2020, employees were requested to complete e-learnings that helped interpret our Integrity Code. Dedicated communication campaigns urged everyone to speak-up and report concerns of possible violations. In those campaigns, the availability of our Ethics hotline was also\n\nhighlighted. This initiative is an integrated and ongoing activity we have embedded in our business and business principles, which we redeploy on a regular basis and share with our new employees as part of their on-boarding program.\n\nBased on a country risk assessment, multiple manufacturing locations were considered to have an increased likelihood of policy violations. Since 2017, these locations are requested to periodically fill in a dedicated self-assessment on human\n\nrights. In 2020, no systemic violations were identified at any of the sites.\n\n## Living wages\n\nRecognition and rewards has been identified as an important engagement driver for our employees and direct suppliers. By ensuring good working conditions, Signify not only aims to provide a fair, safe, and respectful environment, but also an inspiring place to work and grow. Fair remuneration is considered a precondition for our employees to flourish. It is our company\n\nGovernance\n\nConsolidated fi nancial statements\n\nSIGNIFY AR2020 -5e proef - 18/2/2021",

In 2020, the majority of the audits were done in China. Through these audits, we reached 71,612 workers employed at supplier production sites. In 2020, the average audit score of our risk suppliers was 72 (2019: 66). Risk suppliers new to the audit program scored 68 (2019: 58). Dedicated follow-up actions to close the non-conformances were carried out for the lower scoring suppliers. After implementing the corrective action plans, the average overall audit score in 2020 was 79 out of 100.\n\nFor selected suppliers in risk countries, full audits are performed in a three-year cycle by an independent audit firm. If non-conformances are identified, we require the supplier to develop and execute a corrective action plan. We support our suppliers to correct the non-conformances, for instance by providing training or sharing best practices. We monitor the execution of the corrective action plans until the supplier is compliant with our requirements. In case of delays, the supplier is classified as non-compliant in our Tritium program and we apply a stratified approach for consequence management. Tritium is a program that helps us develop a strong supply chain with best-in-class suppliers and is based on selection and rewards criteria against our strategic priorities. We work with each supplier to\n\n## Summary of 2020 audit program (three-year cycle, third-party audit)\n\n|                                   | Greater  China   | Rest of  the World   | Americas   |   Europe | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------|----------|---------|\n| Total no. of risk suppliers       | 180              | 43                   | 24         |        1 | 248     |\n| Total no. of audits               | 60               | 7                    | 6          |        0 | 73      |\n| Initial audits                    | 11               | 5                    | 4          |        0 | 20      |\n| Continued conformance audits      | 49               | 2                    | 2          |        0 | 53      |\n| Workers employed at sites audited | 58,452           | 10,220               | 2,940      |        0 | 71,612  |\n\npolicy to offer remuneration that meets or exceeds the provisions of all applicable wage laws, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours and legally mandated benefits. Additionally, Signify launched its Living Wages program in 2017.\n\nEvery two years, Signify performs an analysis of salaries and benefits for employees globally with respect to living wage, covering the necessary living costs. We compare our living wages to the WageIndicator Foundation database. In 2019, Signify performed an analysis that showed that company standards exceed the living wage standards in all countries examined (such as the Netherlands, China or India).\n\nFair compensation in terms of wages, overtime and benefits for our suppliers' employees in risk countries is part of our sustainable supply chain program. Through our intervention, 98% of our risk suppliers met our requirements.\n\nIn 2020, we started to collect relevant data among our suppliers and we will continue to do this in 2021.\n\n## Social responsibility in our supply chain\n\nSignify has developed programs over the years to prevent Human Rights violations in its supply chain. We have a direct business relationship with approximately 3,290 product and component suppliers. Responsible procurement practices and management of our supply chain require a structured and innovative approach due to the wide variety of stakeholders.\n\nOur programs cover the assessment and development of supplier sustainability performance (audits and training) and responsible minerals sourcing. Through our efforts, we foster decent work and economic growth by improving the safety & wellbeing of suppliers and directly contribute to the SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth.\n\n## Supplier sustainability performance\n\nThe core of our supplier sustainability performance program is the Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD). This declaration forms an integral part of our supplier contracts and can be found on our website: https://www.signify.com/ global/contact/suppliers/sustainability/ our-programs/supplier-sustainabilitymanagement.\n\nThe SSD is derived from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and sets out the standards and behaviors we require from our suppliers and their suppliers. It covers labor, health & safety, environment, ethics and management systems. We monitor supplier compliance with the SSD through a system of regular audits. In the RBA Code of Conduct and in our SSD, special attention is given to the prevention of human slavery as referred to in the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act Disclosures and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The formal statement on these legislations can be found on our website (see link above).",

Global supply chains in the lighting industry are long and complex, typically with more than seven tiers between the finished product and the source of raw materials used for manufacturing. However, we believe that through strong multistakeholder partnerships we can make a difference.\n\nAs part of the Signify Conflict Minerals program, we implement measures in our supply chain to ensure that our products are not directly or indirectly funding atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We support and follow the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. The full description of our due diligence process and Signify's position on Conflict Minerals are available on our website: https://www.signify.com/global/contact/ suppliers/sustainability/our-programs/ conflict-minerals.\n\nWe are an active member of the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) which runs the audit program to verify the smelters' conflict-free status. We use the tools and programs developed by the RMI, especially the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) and the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). Each year, we invite our main suppliers, based on purchasing spend and metal usage, to fill in the latest version of the CMRT. We carefully review the\n\nIn addition to the audits with current risk suppliers, we audited 35 potential suppliers as part of the supplier qualification process. For potential suppliers to continue the qualification process, they should not have any zero-tolerance issues and score a minimum of 70 points. Additionally, nonconformances need to be closed before completing the qualification process.\n\nSince 2016, we have performed an annual verification for the highest risk suppliers. Depending on the risk category this can either be an on-site audit or a selfassessment questionnaire. In 2020, we performed 3 onsite annual verification audits and validated 41 self-assessment questionnaires (2019: 5 onsite annual verifications and 42 self-assessment questionnaires). The average initial score in these annual verification audits was 73 and the average score of the self-assessments was 94. Due to COVID-19 we had to perform 5 remote audits and postpone 13 audits to the beginning of 2021.\n\n## Supplier training and developments\n\nSince 2017, we have put in place on-site trainings for our suppliers. These trainings are tailored towards the non-conformances that were found during the audit. By doing so, we train supplier staff on the topics that are most important for them to improve on. In 2020, we performed on-site trainings at 75 supplier sites, with a total of 523 attendees.\n\nWe also organize training sessions on the RBA Code of Conduct and SSD. To address critical and emerging issues, we provide in-depth capability building programs for our suppliers on specific topics. In 2020, we focused these extra trainings on carbon emissions and reduction activities, related to the CDP Supply Chain program and initiated a new Science Based Targets (SBT) program with two of our Chinese suppliers. This program includes regular in-depth training together with CDP experts to help our suppliers to implement SBTs, driving greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction in our supply chain. We expect our suppliers to submit their first SBTs in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, we organized 5 training sessions which were attended by 202 suppliers, with a total of 320 attendees.\n\n## Reducing water and air pollution levels in China\n\nTo reduce the environmental pollution in China, Signify worked with the Chinese Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE), leveraging their work to engage with our suppliers. For instance, to help suppliers better understand environmental issues, we organized two IPE training sessions in July and December 2020 as a part of our overall RBA training program. Periodically, IPE publishes a list of Chinese factories associated with concerning environmental pollution levels. Signify engages with any suppliers on the IPE list to resolve environmental non-conformances. From 2015 to the end of 2020, there were 51 direct suppliers flagged on the IPE's list, which was reduced to 9 by year-end 2020, and 42 suppliers have taken action to remediate and their violation records were removed from the IPE website. Signify also requested direct suppliers to engage their own direct suppliers that appear on the IPE's list to resolve non-\n\nconformances.",

It resulted in the identification of 8 direct suppliers that provide components or parts which contain mica, 9 suppliers for cobalt, 13 for lithium and 13 suppliers for graphite.\n\nCobalt is present in our battery supply chain for emergency lighting and remote controls, making up less than 1% of our bill of material spend. Despite this, we have prioritized this topic and engaged on responsible sourcing standards. Since 2018, we have been part of the Fair Cobalt Alliance with Fairphone, Huayou and Impact Facility. The Alliance aims to improve health and safety, to provide fairer income, support communities in artisanal small-scale mines (ASM) and contribute to the development of a transparent battery supply chain. In 2019, we developed a strategic plan with our partners, which is currently being deployed. This year, we launched an exclusive partnership with the Signify Foundation to amplify the impacts of the Fair Cobalt Alliance and to support communities in the area of the Artisanal Mines in Kasulu and Kamilombe, from where we source cobalt. We will light up market places, schools and a stadium - impacting schools attendance by children and improving safety in the area.\n\n## 16.3.3 Safety at work\n\n## Health & Safety performance\n\nThe health and safety of our employees is a top priority. We commit to provide a safe working environment for our employees and we contribute to the achievement of the SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth,\n\nThe total recordable case (TRC) rate is the central lagging indicator through which we measure our overall safety performance. Targets for this indicator are set and managed at a company-wide level, and for the individual divisions and manufacturing sites. In our Brighter Lives, Better World sustainability program, we set an overall company target of 0.35 for 2020. We achieved this ambitious target through continuous improvement cycles, followed up with daily management reviews and regular operational reviews. At the end of 2020, our TRC rate was 0.22 and we are happy to report 0 fatality incidents.\n\nWe continued to focus on equipment safety, warehousing safety, behavorial safety,\n\ninformation received via the CMRT from each supplier against our requirements. After identifying the smelters in our supply chain, we publish our Signify Conflict Minerals Declaration, including our smelter list on the company website (see link above). Each year, we update the Signify smelter list with new information received from our suppliers.\n\nAnticipating the European Union (EU) Conflict Minerals legislation coming into force in January 2021, we have reviewed our process and we already comply with the\n\nupcoming requirements. Signify 's imports of Tungsten into the EU are fully supplied by conforming smelters.\n\nIn 2020 we invited 143 priority suppliers to fill in the CMRT, among which 32% were new suppliers. These suppliers represent over 80% of the total Signify spend in scope for this program. We approved 92% of the CMRTs against the Signify requirements. From the suppliers whose Conflict Minerals Reporting Templates were approved, we identified 244 smelters in our supply chain.\n\n## Results of the RCOI (Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry)\n\n|                                                                             |   Gold |   Tantalum |   Tin |   Tungsten |   Total |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|-------|------------|---------|\n| Smelters known to source from the covered  countries (CC)                   |      2 |         26 |     8 |         10 |      46 |\n| Smelters known to source from conflict  affected or high risk areas (CAHRA) |      3 |         26 |     8 |         10 |      47 |\n| Smelters known to process only recycled   or scrap materials                |     32 |         26 |    24 |         22 |     104 |\n| Smelters known to source from outside   the CC/ CAHRA's                     |    104 |         12 |    44 |         33 |     193 |\n\nSince 2016, we are a member of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), a public-private partnership initiative. The EPRM provides a platform for cooperation between European governments, companies and civil society to address the issues occurring in the mining of minerals and to enable responsible sourcing from high risk and conflict regions.\n\nIn 2020, we applied the same approach for cobalt and we invited 5 priority suppliers to fill in the Cobalt Reporting Table (CRT).\n\nIn total, 5 cobalt smelters in our supply chain were covered in Signify's CRT. More can be found on our website https://www.signify. com/global/contact/suppliers/ sustainability/our-programs/responsibleminerals.\n\nThe results of the Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI) for conflict minerals can be found in the table above.

This campaign was launched to raise awareness of the importance to speak up when employees encounter integrity concerns. Employees were requested to complete a mandatory e-learning, and by the end of 2020 the completion rate was 93% of the targeted employees.\n\nIn 2020, 178 Integrity Code concerns were captured via the Signify Ethics line and through our network of compliance officers, a 10% decrease on 2019. The Speak up campaign clearly resulted in increased integrity awareness among our employees, which led to a higher number of concerns raised. Our analysis however seems to indicate the increase was more than counterbalanced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Details per category are shown in the table on next the page.\n\n## Most commonly reported concerns\n\n## Treatment of employees\n\nThe category Treatment of employees represents 48% of the total cases reported (58% in 2019). Within this category, the largest subcategory is Equal, fair & respectful treatment. This made up to 70% of the concerns related to Treatment of employees in 2020 (78% in 2019). This category, for example, relates to concerns about verbal abuse, (sexual) harassment, favoritism and matters of discrimination in the workplace. We believe\n\nthe decrease may be partly due to a\n\non-site contractors' safety and managing progress for leading indicators related to first aid cases, near-misses, unsafe conditions and at-risk behaviors.\n\nThis year, with the COVID-19 outbreak, we prioritized the implementation of dedicated preventive measures at all our locations in the first quarter of 2020. Activities included the introduction of COVID-19 observations at industrial sites, leader standard work for safety deployment and the \"Stop the spread\" campaign with the objective to increase employee engagement and quality of injury prevention actions.\n\nWe recorded 52 TRC cases in 2020 (82 TRC cases in 2019). The TRC rate decreased to 0.22 per 100 FTEs, compared to 0.32 in 2019. This is a 31% improvement compared to last year and meets our 2020 target on safety.\n\n44% of our industrial units had no recordable injuries in 2020. There are 6 industrial sites that have had no recordable injuries over the last 3 years - Varginha, Pila Home, Riyadh - NLC, New Oxford, Warehouse Monterrey, Maarheeze, while 62 sites had achieved more than 500 days injury-free.\n\n## Recordable cases\n\n|                             |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total recordable  case rate |   0.29 |   0.32 |   0.22 |\n| Lost workday  cases rate    |   0.18 |   0.19 |   0.17 |\n| Fatalities                  |   1    |   1    |   0    |\n\nOur injury prevention framework was launched in 2015 and has continued its integration into the operational Lean framework and office Lean framework. All our industrial sites have now adopted the key elements of this framework. Efforts continued to further reduce injury and illness rates by focusing on daily standards to prevent injuries. We increased our injury prevention requirements in the upgrades of Signify's Lean program.\n\nAs part of our new Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program, we will continue to strengthen our programs to maintain a safe and healthy workplace. We set an even more ambitious TRC target of 0.30 in 2025, with the ambition for all individual sites to reach it.\n\n## Management system\n\nIn 2020, Signify updated the multisite management system according to the OHSAS 18001 standard to the new ISO 45001 standard. Part of our manufacturing sites continued to be certified locally according to the OHSAS 18001. At the end of 2020, 72% of our reporting manufacturing sites were certified to OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001. The remaining manufacturing sites have procedures in place which assure compliance with local regulations and Signify policies.\n\n## Health and wellbeing initiatives\n\nApart from our commitment to provide an injury-free workplace, we support our employees with their health and wellbeing. Through diverse initiatives managed by our\n\ncountry offices, our staff are enabled to proactively work on their vitality and personal health. Examples of initiatives which support active health management include:\n\n- \u00b7 periodic health-checks\n- \u00b7 discounts to health and sports centers\n- \u00b7 Signify Work-out program\n- \u00b7 Physical and ergonomic training\n\nIn addition, several of our office spaces are using lighting technologies which enable lumen outputs to follow the human circadian rhythm, enabling our employees to see, feel and function better.\n\nTo stop the spread of COVID-19, and as a pilot, we installed UV-C luminaires in Signify's office in Amsterdam to help disinfect the office air, leading to a better and safer work environment for Signify employees.\n\n## 16.3.4 Acting with integrity\n\n## Signify's Integrity Code\n\nThe Integrity Code serves as our code of conduct. This code embodies our commitment to always act with integrity, both in our internal and external interactions. The code sets the standard for business conduct of our employees and for the company itself and also gives more information on how to speak up or raise concerns. Translations of our Integrity Code are available in 26 languages.\n\nFor a description of Integrity Code processes and policies, please refer to",

We are focusing on improving our digital front and back-ends and increasing our data analytics capabilities to better serve our customers. In this context, it has been more important than ever to ensure that access to network, IT systems and data is assured at all times.\n\nSignify has a dedicated corporate security department which provides guidance and assurance as well as implements our three lines of defense governance model which focuses on information, product and operational security. We created a process for developing secure (new) products and services, as well as a remediation process in case vulnerabilities are identified. Second, a security operation reporting center is responsible for detection, mitigation and resolution of cybersecurity related incidents, enabling action to be taken in a timely manner. Technical security measures are implemented to support the 'defense in depth' principle, starting from the collection of information to infrastructure controls.\n\nsubstantial increase in the number of employees who worked from home or remotely in 2020.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nThe second most reported type of concern relates to Business integrity. The number of complaints reported in this segment represents 33% of the total cases reported (34% in 2019).\n\nIn 2020, we saw a notable increase in reported cases relating to Security, including IT. This category represents 13% of the total cases reported in 2020 (5% in 2019) and relates, for instance, to concerns about unauthorized use of the company's\n\n## Breakdown of alleged violations Integrity code\n\n|                                           | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Health & Safety                           | 4      | -      | 2      |\n| Treatment of employees                    | 90     | 114    | 86     |\n| \u00b7 Equal, fair and respectful treatment    | 66     | 89     | 60     |\n| \u00b7 Employee development                    | 1      | 1      | 4      |\n| \u00b7 Employee privacy                        | -      | -      | -      |\n| \u00b7 Employee relations                      | 8      | 1      | 2      |\n| \u00b7 Remuneration                            | 1      | 2      | 5      |\n| \u00b7 Right to organize/Collective bargaining | -      | 1      | -      |\n| \u00b7 Working hours                           | 3      | 1      | 2      |\n| \u00b7 HR other                                | 11     | 19     | 13     |\n| Legal                                     | 3      | 4      | 7      |\n| Business integrity                        | 69     | 66     | 59     |\n| Security, including IT                    | 11     | 9      | 24     |\n| Other                                     | 9      | 4      | -      |\n| Total                                     | 186    | 197    | 178    |\n\nassets, theft, cyber security or other IT related concerns. A number of reports were filed relating to the same issue. The increase can also be attributed to the general view that the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a general increase in cybercrime. Signify implemented new tools to prevent and react on cybercrime, for example by detecting unwanted activities in our network.\n\n## Substantiated concerns\n\nOf the 178 cases reported in 2020, 44 were open as of December 31, 2020. Of the 134 reports which were closed in 2020, 68 were found to be substantiated, which represents 51% of the closed cases.\n\n## Responsible tax policy\n\nOur tax principles are based on the recognition that tax is an integral element of our overall corporate social responsibility as well as commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals. The UN and other global organizations have emphasized the importance of fair contributions and are asking for more transparency on tax. Responsible Tax Policy is an important topic for Signify to report upon.\n\nFor us, acting with integrity means paying the right amount of tax, in the right place, at the right time. Being a responsible taxpayer is aligned with our purpose, business strategy and Integrity Code. Our Tax Principles set the standard for our conduct, by which individual employees, the company and its subsidiaries must abide. The tax principles ensure compliance with local and international tax laws and internationally accepted standards of good corporate governance such as various OECD Guidelines. We are committed to providing timely, regular, and reliable information on Signify's tax position, including the Group effective tax rate, our corporate income tax contributions, and our main tax exposures (see note 9, Income taxes, of this Annual Report).\n\nSignify has a Tax Control Framework in place, which provides awareness and assurance of adherence to up-to-date tax policies. Our Board of Management approves our tax strategy and reviews the tax control framework and our key tax positions. External auditors regularly review",

Trough our actions, we increase food availability and quality as directly contribute to the achievement of the SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing.\n\n## NatureConnect blue sky\n\nSkanska wants to create a healthy, engaging and inspiring working environment despite the absence of daylight.\n\nThe company chose Signify NatureConnect in one of its offices, combining different LED luminaires with intuitive controls to create lighting scenes tailored to people's needs. NatureConnect provides a view to the sky, brings the colors and dynamic of nature into the workplace and increases employees' productivity and wellbeing.\n\nAdditionally, our employees are asked to complete a mandatory training on security. Our cybersecurity requirements also apply to our partners and suppliers as part of security schedules and contracts signed as they need to comply with the same standards we set for ourselves. Our cybersecurity processes and measures are based on ISO 27001 (Information security) and ISO 62443 (Product Security) certifications, as well as other related best practices (such as the National Institute of Standards and technology and the Center of Internet Security).\n\nAll cybersecurity activities are reported to and monitored by the Security Board, chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Rondolat. Other members of the board are the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Security Officer, the Heads of Internal Audit, Legal and Human Resources. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are informed regularly.\n\n## Product quality\n\nSignify has a strong commitment to responsible product stewardship. The Signify quality management system is ISO 9001:2015 certified, covering all business activities. When it comes to quality, we believe prevention of defects is better than cure. This is reflected in our structured approach towards the selection and qualification of suppliers, manufacturing, installation and delivery of our products and services. In line with mandatory legislation throughout the world, Signify is committed to place only safe products on the market. In the event products have been brought to\n\nmarket that do not meet the essential safety requirements, Signify takes a systematic approach and appropriate actions, which may include a product recall, especially in case the health and safety of individuals are of concern. Signify has a robust process in place to ensure impacted constituents are informed. In 2020, no product safety issues were found that resulted in a material fine or penalty.\n\n## 16.3.5 Social impact of light\n\nWe are driving change to create brighter futures. Through our technology, social and business life no longer stops when the sun goes down. Light enables recreation, productivity and economic growth.\n\n## Human-Centric lighting\n\nLight allows us to see and to experience the world around us. Additionally, it affects us visually, biologically and emotionally, supporting comfort, wellbeing and performance. Scientific evidence shows that light has a powerful impact on our emotions and important physiological and biological processes in our body. Circadian lighting in an office environment for instance makes an office more livable and up to 12% more productive.\n\nIn 2020, we extended our Human-Centric lighting portfolio helping people to see, feel, and function better and continued to contribute to the achievement of the SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing. We launched NatureConnect - Lighting inspired by Nature. NatureConnect brings the benefits\n\nof natural light Indoors with constant cycles and variations of nature to create healthy, engaging and attractive environments. NatureConnect enhances wellbeing, boosts performance and creates an inspiring environment.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic triggered an extension of our portfolio to new innovative solutions based on our UV-C offering. The quality of the air we breathe and the cleanliness of the surfaces we touch have a profound effect on our health and wellbeing. The risk of contracting and spreading viruses and bacteria increases in busy and public areas like the office, stores, schools, museums and public transports. A proven and effective way to neutralize a virus is through UV-C radiation. In laboratory testing, our UV-C light sources inactivated 99% of the coronavirus 2 on a surface with an exposure time of 6 seconds.\n\n## Food availability and quality\n\nThe challenges we face will require more efficient food production to support an additional two billion people by 2050. The current livestock feed production uses almost 50% of total global agricultural land, and agriculture consumes about 70% of the world's water supply. Globally, food production and distribution contribute significantly to the increase in global GHG emissions.\n\nIn 2020, Signify continued the development of agricultural lighting to help growers and farmers globally to produce sustainable and healthy food, increasing yields and quality and improving animal wellbeing.",

Reports launched this year were guidelines to solar lighting for refugee camps, impact of subsidies on uptake of solar products by lower income group populations and market landscape analysis for the solar lighting sectors in 5 countries in Africa.\n\nLooking forward, we are setting ourselves the target of lighting 10 million lives by the end of 2025.\n\n## 16.3.6 Working with stakeholders\n\nIn the further development of our Brighter Lives, Better World program and commitments to the relevant UN SDGs, Signify has again stepped up its work with strategic partners and stakeholders.\n\nIn 2020, our first major stakeholder event was the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. There, we joined a number of sessions related to sustainable development, circular economy and climate change and received broad recognition for our leadership in these areas. We participated in the CEO Climate Leadership Alliance, where we urged for enhanced climate action in the important decade we have embarked upon. Shortly after this event, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of several international events including the postponement of COP26 in Glasgow to 2021.\n\nNevertheless, in 2020, we had a strong online stakeholder program with virtual\n\n## Access to light\n\nWith a global health pandemic raging through the world, the link between lighting and access to modern health care has never been more evident. From adequate lighting in and around primary health care centers to the disinfectant properties of UV-C light, humanitarian relief efforts have been front and center of our focus over 2020.\n\nIn its third year of operations, the Signify Foundation remains committed to enabling access to the benefits of sustainable lighting to underserved communities and contribute to the SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities. To fulfill this mission, we partner with actors across the entire value chain that play a key role in the delivery of clean technology based lighting systems to homes, communal spaces and institutions, empowering communities to be safer, active and economically productive after sunset.\n\nAs the Foundation's program has matured, there has been a conscious shift in allocation of resources towards a diversified\n\nand differentiated approach where base-ofpyramid social enterprises are enabled to strengthen their capability to serve last-mile communities. We aim to address barriers to growth and sustainability of a robust market where local lighting needs are met by local suppliers. The impact of lighting lives is long lasting through investment rather than aid, through the creation of market ecosystems where lighting can be bought and sold and not provided through charitable interventions only. This strategic evolution is also reflected in the financial support structures. Indeed, recoverable grants or blended facilities of unconditional and recoverable grants are made available to help social enterprises overcome their barriers to growth and scale.\n\nSignify entities around the globe actively contribute to the communities that they operate in by lighting up public service institutions like hospitals, schools and sporting facilities while donating clean technology-based lighting to underserved households.\n\nThrough projects supported by the combined resources of the corporate social responsibility and Signify Foundation, we have outperformed our target and lit 6 million lives in communities around the globe (target 5 million lives, baseline 2017). In addition, we have supported 9,266 people with technical and business skills development (target 10,000 people, baseline 2017). A number of training activities have been postponed due to COVID-19 restrictions in countries of operation.\n\nThe shift in focus on light for health care as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic this year has prompted a review of our impact calculation framework to expand its scope to not just 'access to light', but to the 'benefits of sustainable lighting' provided. Our long-term intent is to move towards reporting of social, environmental, and socio-economic impact of the lighting - mainly in terms of safety & security, job creation, income generation, gender equality, education & health.\n\nFurther, in virgin areas where a standard calculation methodology could benefit the sector at large, for instance solar outdoor lighting, we aim to gather data along our projects in diverse geographies and trigger the process of creating industry standards for calculating and reporting output, outcomes and the impact of lighting.\n\nThis year, we have also launched a knowledge portal to enable open source access to insights and technical knowledge that would provide strategic support to help other actors aligned with the mission to",

With the WEF, we participated in a number of workstreams on the topics of economic recovery and enhanced climate action. Throughout the year, we were deeply involved in the advocacy that followed on the announcement of the European Green Deal in November 2019. As a consequence of the economic recession of the first quarter, we reached out to the European institutions with a number of other companies and industries through the European Alliance, the Corporate Leadership Group (CLG) Europe and EuroAce. This advocacy work contributed to the definition of the Next Generation Europe recovery program five focal areas, with the ultimate goal of regional climate neutrality by 2050. Through the CLG Europe, a call to action was prepared and signed by over 180 CEOs and other leaders to increase the 2030 GHG reduction target to at least 55% of carbon emissions. This call was referenced by European Commission's Ursula von der Leyen in her first State of the Union on September 16th.\n\nAs in previous years, we joined several events during the 2020 (virtual) Climate Week NYC, where Eric Rondolat announced Signify's carbon neutrality achievement in a special event with EU Commission's First Vice-President Frans Timmermans. During other events held by the World Green Building Council and the US-based Business Council for Sustainable Energy and Alliance to Save Energy, we built on the 'Three Percent Club' partnership and advocated the need to, at least, double infrastructure renovation rates to 3% per year as a critical enabler of the global pathway to climate neutrality. The 3% goal has now been included as the first focus area - the Renovation Wave - in the European economic recovery program.\n\nThe relevance of a green and digital economic recovery is being shared with stakeholder organizations in all other regions so that these focal areas get adopted more broadly and a sustainable recovery will gradually transform in a 'race to the future' with global climate neutrality latest by 2050 as the common goal.",

Energy is selected as the key criterion, as this sustainable focal area consistently has the highest environmental impact, as shown through life-cycle assessments. In 2020, Sustainable revenues grew to an all-time high of 84.1%.\n\n## Two billion LED lamps & luminaires\n\nThrough our digital LED technology, Signify offers light that is up to 80% more energy efficient, compared with conventional technologies, which are still commonly used. For this reason, we have pledged to deliver two billion LED lamps & luminaires by the end of 2020 (baseline 2015). When combined with digitally connected systems, we can save energy equivalent to that generated by 58 medium-sized coal-fired power stations (equivalent to emissions from 21 million cars).\n\nAt the end of 2020, Signify delivered 2,923 million LED lamps and luminaires. Considering the environmental impact of avoided carbon emissions, our LED lamps & luminaires delivered thus far have saved 72,988 kilotonnes in CO 2 , equal to EUR 7,381 million in societal costs saved.\n\n## LED lamps & luminaires delivered in millions\n\n| of units             |       |\n|----------------------|-------|\n| 2018                 | 552   |\n| 2019                 | 596   |\n| 2020                 | 578   |\n| Cumulative from 2015 | 2,923 |\n\n## 16.4  Better World\n\nIn 2016, we set ambitious targets to minimize the environmental impact of our activities for a better world. As we continuously strive for excellence in environmental management, we develop and implement programs and report on our progress. As a result, we celebrated 100% carbon neutrality in our operations and the use of 100% renewable electricity in September 2020, ahead of our targets.\n\nIn 2020, we continued our efforts to align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and we launched an internal working group to further analyze our climate risk mitigation and adaptation strategy. We made significant progress towards our Science-Based Targets, as reported below in the carbon footprint and energy section.\n\nIn our next five-year program, we commit to go beyond carbon neutrality and to double the pace of the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C scenario, focusing on emission reductions in our entire value chain.\n\nAll our environmental policies and management framework are based on the international ISO 14001 standard. In 2020, 82% of our manufacturing sites were certified to ISO 14001.\n\n## 16.4.1 Energy efficiency of our products, systems and services\n\nLighting makes up 13% of global electricity consumption and 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Phasing out energy inefficient conventional lighting and switching to energy-efficient LEDs and solar lighting still has significant environmental benefits. That is why energy efficiency is a vital aspect of our innovation process. In 2016, we have set the ambitious target to have 80% of our revenues coming from sustainable products, systems and services by the end of 2020. By delivering cleaner solutions, we are proud to contribute to the achievement of the SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy.\n\nSustainable revenues are measured as a percentage of total revenues per product family and tracked for each Division. Sustainable revenues are defined as products with an energy efficiency of 66 lm/W and higher as well as all systems and\n\n## Sustainable revenues in millions of EUR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping realizing the EU Green Deal through LED lighting\n\nThe city of Davos is aiming for at least 50% CO 2 reduction by 2030 to achieve the objectives set in the EU Green Deal. Together with ELEKTRON AG, Signify has replaced 50% of the city's streetlights with energy-efficient LEDs connected to the Interact City system to achieve a saving of more than 72,000kWh per year. Additionally, we upgraded almost 900 lights of the Davos' Congress Center, saving 50,000 kWh in energy per year. The city of Davos reduces its carbon emissions by 68.5 tons per year.",

Among others, we initiated off-grid renewable energy generation with solar panels in India. We continued to support reforestation and forest conservation in Colombia and Zimbabwe and kept our engagement in increasing the availability of renewable electricity through wind farms in India. Our partnership with South Pole enabled us to offset 100% of our emissions, resulting in a net zero carbon footprint.\n\n## Operational carbon footprint in kilotonnes\n\n|        |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross  |    401 |    363 |    260 |\n| Offset |    255 |    299 |    260 |\n| Net    |    146 |     64 |      0 |\n\n## 16.4.2 Carbon footprint and energy\n\nAt Signify, we have a long-term commitment to increase the energy efficiency of our products and reduce energy use in our production processes. We acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and believe we have an important role to play in the transformation towards a low-carbon economy. In September 2020, we became the first lighting company to be carbon neutral in its operations and we shifted to 100% renewable electricity, ahead of our target and ahead of the aspirations set out by the Paris Agreement. Over the last decade, Signify reduced its operational footprint by more than 70% and has been driving hundreds of initiatives to reduce emissions in factories, offices, logistics and business travel. As a manufacturing company we still have unavoidable emissions, like for example from the use of natural gas in glass ovens, so we invest in certified carbon offsetting projects.\n\nClimate Action is a key focus of our new Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program and we will continue our contribution to the achievement of the SDG 13: Climate Action. We will go beyond carbon neutrality and double the pace to reach the 1.5\u00b0C scenario goal laid out in the Paris Agreement. We will reach the 2031 pathway in 2025, six years early, by increasing the energy efficiency of our portfolio to help our customers reducing emissions and driving carbon reductions at our suppliers.\n\n## Climate Action and Leadership\n\nIn 2020, Our Brighter Lives, Better World program won the United Nations Climate Neutral Now Award. And, we have been recognized again in CDP's Climate A list for our leadership in environmental performance.\n\nSignify is one of the first 28 companies committing to verified Science-Based Targets in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C pathway to cut GHG emissions in our operations as well as in our value chain. We commit to reduce 70% of absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 30% of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 (baseline 2015).\n\nAt the end of 2020, we achieved:\n\n- \u00b7 55% reduction of absolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions (baseline 2015)\n- \u00b7 42% reduction of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products (baseline 2015).\n\nWe continue to partner with the Climate Group's EV100 Initiative to operate a lease fleet of hybrid and fully electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Additionally, in 2020, Signify joined the AndresReizen Dutch Business Sustainable Mobility Pledge to further improve the sustainability performance of our business travel. Through our partnership with the RE100 Initiative, we shifted to 100% renewable electricity use in 2020. As an active member of Clean Cargo and the WBCSD Transforming Heavy Transport project, we engage in crossindustry collaboration and strive to lower the carbon footprint of our freight\n\ntransport. Our continuous pledge to the World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings commitment facilitates improvement in energy efficiency as well as reduction in electricity consumption in our non-industrial buildings.\n\n## Operational carbon footprint\n\nThrough continuous efforts in various departments, we are a fully carbon neutral company. Our operational carbon footprint consists of manufacturing, non-industrial operations, logistics, and business travel.\n\nIn 2020, our total CO 2 emissions were 260 kilotonnes, a 28% decrease year-on-year. This decrease can be partly explained by the impact of COVID-19 on our reduction of emissions from logistics and business travel. Our operational CO 2 efficiency in tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent per million-euro sales was 50 in 2020, a 14% improvement compared to 2019.\n\nLo\n\nBusi",

At the end 2020, we signed a 10-year PPA with a new built wind farm in Finland for our European operations, which is expected to power our European operations with green electricity from 2023 onward. Our PPAs contribute to the transition to more sustainable electricity grids and reinforce our long-term commitment to using renewable electricity.\n\n## Enabling carbon reduction in our supply chain\n\nIn 2020, we continued to engage our supply chain to reduce its carbon footprint. Our approach is to proactively initiate, develop and support carbon emission reduction activities in the supply chain through our partnership with the CDP Supply Chain program.\n\nIn 2020, we invited 711 (404 in 2019) of our strategic suppliers to the program, of which 72% submitted the 2020 CDP questionnaire, which is an increase of almost 70% compared to 2019.\n\nThis represents 91% of project related spend, which is higher than 2019 (87% of the spend). In 2020, 296 strategic suppliers reported emission reduction activities, overachieving our target of 200 strategic suppliers annually reporting emission reduction activities. 257 of our strategic suppliers disclosed their annual scope 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect) emissions (target 2020: at least 250 suppliers).\n\n## Signify tailored offset project\n\nIn 2020, Signify created its own carbon offsetting project together with South Pole and the Signify Foundation. Over 500.000 people in the Gumla region in India live in off-grid communities, depending on candles and kerosene. Through our tailored project, we connect them to solar mini grids to ensure reliable renewable electricity access and install energy-efficient lighting to brighten their lives after dark.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nWe cut our manufacturing carbon footprint by 49% since 2015, the baseline year for our Brighter Lives, Better Word sustainability program. In 2020, manufacturing accounted for 60% of our operational carbon footprint, which has been reduced by 9% compared to 2019. This was achieved mainly due to continuous operational changes and efficiency improvements, for instance optimization of heating systems.\n\n## Non-industrial operations\n\nIn 2020, CO 2 emissions from non-industrial operations (offices, warehouses) represented 2% of our total carbon footprint. In 2020, our emissions from non-industrial operations decreased by 17% year-on-year, primarily through reaching 100% renewable electricity and energy efficiency improvements.\n\n## Logistics\n\nIn 2020, 35% of our total CO 2 emissions was attributed to logistics, which decreased by 43% compared to 2019. We focused on implementing strict approval procedures and actively promoting sustainable alternatives. Our air transport emissions went down by 45%. Driven by our commitment to sustainable logistics, we remained engaged in the Clean Cargo buyer-supplier forum. This enabled us to successfully reduce emissions from road freight and ocean freight by 40% and 43%.\n\n## Business travel\n\nOver the past years, we implemented our sustainable travel policy and succeeded to reduce our carbon footprint from business travel by 86% since 2015. In 2020, our CO 2 emissions related to business travel accounted for 3% of our operational carbon footprint. We achieved a 71% reduction compared to 2019, as a result of our efforts and the impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions. We lowered emissions from air travel by 82.5% from 16 to 2.8 kilotonnes.\n\n## Operational carbon footprint in kilotonnes\n\n## CO 2 -equivalent\n\n|                            | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1                    | 172    | 168    | 161    |\n| Scope 2                    |        |        |        |\n| (market based)             | 25     | 10     | 1      |\n| Scope 3                    |        |        |        |\n| business travel            | 30     | 25     | 7      |\n| Scope 3 logistics          | 174    | 160    | 91     |\n| Of which                   |        |        |        |\n| \u00b7 Air transport            | 71     | 73     | 40     |\n| \u00b7 Road                     |        |        |        |\n| transport                  | 51     | 40     | 24     |\n| \u00b7 Ocean                    |        |        |        |\n| transport                  | 52     | 47     | 27     |\n| Total Signify              | 401    | 363    | 260    |\n| Scope 2   (location based) | 202    | 181    | 160    |\n\n## Energy use in operations\n\nOur total energy usage in 2020 amounted to 3,728 terajoules, 4% lower than the previous year. This decrease was due to operational changes, reduced heating requirements and energy efficiency improvements in our factories. Our operational energy efficiency in terajoules per million-euro sales was 0.72 in 2020 (0.62 in 2019).\n\n## Electricity\n\nIn 2020, we procured 100% of our electricity from renewable sources. This achievement directly contributes to the SDG 7: Clean and affordable energy. All electricity consumed by our operations worldwide was sourced from renewable sources or matched with Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Approximately 16% of our renewable electricity was contracted via our energy providers. 35% was sourced through the",

The gearflex technology helps installer to replace and reprogram drivers in less then 30 seconds. Via the service tag, spare parts and upgradeable components can easily be applied to significantly prolong the product lifetime.\n\nA great example of our serviceable luminaires is our 3D printed luminaires. These luminaires have been designed in a modular way and can be upgraded to meet the emerging needs of customers. Whether these needs are performance improvements (higher efficacy in lm/W or better light quality), a diverse look and feel (different housing), or a system upgrade, the modular concept facilitates these needs. Instead of replacing the whole luminaire, modules can be exchanged or added, thus preserving value and avoiding waste.\n\n## CDP reporters per region and topics reported\n\n|                                                  | Greater China   | Greater China   | Rest of the World   | Rest of the World   | Europe   | Europe   | Americas   | Americas   | Total   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|------------|------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                  | 2019            | 2020            | 2019                | 2020                | 2019     | 2020     | 2019       | 2020       | 2019    | 2020    |\n| Scope 1                                          | 70%             | 78%             | 62%                 | 72%                 | 61%      | 72%      | 61%        | 72%        | 65%     | 74%     |\n| Scope 2                                          | 43%             | 49%             | 62%                 | 47%                 | 44%      | 45%      | 56%        | 50%        | 48%     | 48%     |\n| Scope 1 & 2                                      | 43%             | 51%             | 59%                 | 48%                 | 46%      | 47%      | 55%        | 51%        | 48%     | 50%     |\n| Have a reduction target                          | 58%             | 54%             | 54%                 | 38%                 | 42%      | 41%      | 39%        | 35%        | 48%     | 44%     |\n| Have on-going reduction  activities              | 65%             | 70%             | 54%                 | 47%                 | 51%      | 55%      | 44%        | 46%        | 55%     | 57%     |\n| Climate change  opportunities                    | 70%             | 54%             | 65%                 | 55%                 | 63%      | 60%      | 53%        | 54%        | 64%     | 56%     |\n| Climate change risks                             | 61%             | 49%             | 54%                 | 36%                 | 44%      | 39%      | 45%        | 42%        | 52%     | 43%     |\n| Integrated climate  change in business  strategy | 76%             | 69%             | 76%                 | 66%                 | 79%      | 75%      | 68%        | 62%        | 75%     | 69%     |\n| Integrated climate  change in risk  management   | 71%             | 17%             | 70%                 | 28%                 | 75%      | 31%      | 60%        | 34%        | 70%     | 26%     |\n\nIn total, our suppliers undertook more than 600 initiatives in 2020 leading to almost 32 million metric tons of CO 2 emissions saved (2019: 55 million metric tons).\n\n## 16.4.3 Circular economy\n\nToday, humanity uses 1.6 times the resources our planet can sustain. At Signify, we consider the transition to a circular economy as a key enabler in society's pursuit of a more sustainable world. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by using material\n\nresources more effectively. Our actions cover the whole life cycle of a product (from production, use and re-use to waste management) and directly contribute to the achievement of the SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production.\n\n## Circular lighting portfolio\n\nIn our efforts to transition to a circular economy, we extended our circular lighting portfolio in 2020. Our circular innovations aim at preserving value and avoiding waste and cover four categories: serviceable luminaires, circular components, intelligent systems, and circular services.\n\n- \u00b7 Serviceable luminaires are fixtures that are upgradable, serviceable, connectable, energy-efficient, reusable, and recyclable\n- \u00b7 Circular components are exchangeable and have recyclable parts, such as drivers, controls, and LED boards\n- \u00b7 Intelligent systems monitor serviceable luminaires and enable preventive maintenance\n- \u00b7 Circular services aim to prolong lifetimes and provide customers with end-ofcontract options",

Our efforts also address supply chain improvements, such as remote serviceability (connected lighting) and end-of-life services. By minimizing materials waste and reducing the environmental impact, we create an ecosystem that extends the life of our lighting products and provides a better future for the next generation.\n\n## Reducing the weight of materials of our products\n\nVia well-established sustainable design rules, Signify continuously lowers the weight of new product designs, resulting in less material use and costs for our product portfolio. The sustainable design rules are also optimized for circularity, resulting in better serviceability while increasing recyclability.\n\n## Zero Waste to landfill\n\nSending zero manufacturing waste to landfill is one of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2020 commitments. This commitment might have been the most difficult to fulfill due to the multitude of sites and waste streams. We had to find innovative solutions to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill to zero, and to drive continuous improvements and process optimization across the globe. Thanks to our efforts,\n\nat the end of 2020, 100% of our manufacturing sites put an end to sending waste to landfill, as defined by our commitment.\n\nTo achieve this milestone, we focused our efforts in 2020 on shifting to vendors with more sustainable and eco-friendly ways of processing our waste. We continued to improve our practices regarding waste segregation, waste awareness trainings and sharing best practices across other regions.\n\nIn 2020, Signify registered 1.58 kilotonnes of hazardous waste, of which 39% was recycled. We set the target to yearly reduce our hazardous waste by 5%. Our recycling programs address waste arising from manufacturing activities, such as glass or canteen waste, as well as from suppliers, such as packaging materials.\n\n91% of total waste was recycled in 2020 and we continue to recycle 100% of our metal and glass waste. The focus given to increase the waste recycling rate, by waste segregation at source and optimization of waste processed, has also enabled our sites to identify new opportunities for reducing their overall amount of waste.\n\nTotal manufacturing waste consists of waste that is delivered for recycling, incineration or landfill.\n\n## Manufacturing waste in kilotonnes\n\n|                        | 2018       | 2019       | 2020     |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|----------|\n| Recycled               | 33.3 (82%) | 32.7 (90%) | 30 (91%) |\n| Incinerated            | 3.0 (7%)   | 2.2 (6%)   | 1.9 (6%) |\n| Landfilled             | 4.5 (11%)  | 1.5 (4%)   | 0.9 (3%) |\n| In scope of commitment | 2.4 (6%)   | 0.7 (2%)   | 0 (0%)   |\n| Total waste            | 40.8       | 36.4       | 32.8     |\n\n## Recycling rate per waste category\n\n|                                 | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Canteen waste                   | 32%    | 58%    | 43%    |\n| Chemical waste                  | 22%    | 29%    | 29%    |\n| Electrical and Electronic waste | 97%    | 90%    | 99%    |\n| Glass (line rejects)            | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Metal scrap                     | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Paper/cardboard                 | 99%    | 99%    | 99%    |\n| Plastic waste                   | 86%    | 84%    | 79%    |\n\nWe actively aim to reduce other categories of waste that are excluded from this commitment, such as chemical or hazardous waste, which are mandatory to landfill under legislative regulation or when waste collection and/or treatment is regulated.

Our packaging policy encourages packaging designers, the purchasing community and suppliers to minimize the environmental impact of packaging materials in all phases of the life cycle. This means reducing the amount of packaging used, selecting packaging materials with a high recycled content, and/or selecting virgin packaging materials with a minimal environmental impact from responsible sources.\n\nOur packaging policy requires for the use of 80% recycled paper.\n\nIn 2020, Signify was using over 2,500 tonnes of plastic in its consumer product packaging. These plastics largely end up in landfill, waste incineration or potentially leaks into our environment. To address this environmental concern, Signify announced in June 2020 its commitment to eliminate plastic packaging in its consumer product packaging by the end of 2021.\n\nThe elimination of plastic packaging will equal to 125 million PET bottles which,\n\nplaced in a row, would stretch more than 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles). On top of that, our new packaging is smaller, reducing carbon emissions from transport and the materials we use by 6,000 tonnes per year - equivalent to the amount of CO 2 that 270,000 fully grown trees can absorb in a year.\n\nReplacing plastic packaging with paperbased alternatives will be sequenced across our product portfolio and different regions. In the second half of 2020, all new LED lamps packaging in Europe shifted from blister to paper box.\n\n## 16.4.5 Hazardous substances\n\n## Product substances\n\nThrough sustainable design rules, all new product developments meet stringent sustainability criteria before their market launch. All our products and systems delivered to countries requiring the CE marking are compliant with the RoHS Directive (2011/65/ EU) and REACH (EC 1907/2006) regulations. We require all our suppliers to communicate all substances in their components and to comply with the stipulations that we have listed in our Regulated Substance List (RSL), which in many cases goes beyond legislation. In 2020, we continued to engage with our suppliers, further rolling out the publicly available BOMcheck tool, in which components and substances can be registered.\n\n## Chemical substances in production processes\n\nWe prioritize the safe management of chemicals to ensure that we minimize the risks of the use of these substances related to the environment, society and our employees in their daily work. If there are threats of harm to human safety or the environment, we proactively search for effective alternatives. We have a robust approach to identify and manage regulated and hazardous substances in our production processes.\n\nWe ensure compliance through continuous monitoring of chemicals usage in manufacturing sites. Over the last 10 years, we have been actively phasing out several hazardous substances.\n\nEmissions from mercury and mercury compounds totaled 0.01 kilogram in 2020. The target to achieve emissions As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) was met already in 2015. Signify continues to closely monitor usage, emissions and exposure, to determine if further improvement opportunities are possible.\n\n## Emissions from mercury\n\nSince 2012, we have been able to drastically decrease the emissions from mercury by changing our production processes and replacing liquid mercury with solid-state mercury.",

As we continue to expand our portfolio of LED products, systems, and services, the water intensity of our operations continues to decrease. Despite this, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas with water stress, such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico and parts of the United States, and may face water scarcity risks. To analyze and quantify our exposure to water risk, we utilized the open source Water Risk Monetizer tool by Ecolab, Trucost, and Microsoft. The results show that 40% of our global water consumption is located in regions classified as having extremely high- or high-water scarcity.\n\nWhile some of our facilities have reuse and recycling measures in place, we continued to implement and identify new and more efficient water saving measures as well as continuing our transition to technology and business models which have a lower dependency on water. We aim to reduce our water usage by 5% annually.\n\nTotal water intake in 2020 was 971,000 m 3 , 3% higher compared to 944,000 m 3 in 2019. This increase was mainly due to new installations requiring more water and increased production volumes in sites where water is used for cooling purposes.\n\n49% of our sites state that water is primarily used for domestic purposes.\n\n## Water intake in thousands of m 3\n\n|             | 2018   |   2019 |   2020 |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total water | 1,266  |    944 |    971 |\n\nBased on our methodology for calculating societal impact, we caused EUR 3.7 million in costs to society through our water usage.\n\n## 16.4.7 Biodiversity\n\nPoor quality lighting can increase light pollution and sky glow and as a consequence can negatively impact biodiversity. To ensure that animals, such as bats, are not disturbed by artificial lighting during night-time activities, Signify designed a new light spectrum. The new light recipe helps in maintaining a balanced ecosystem by displaying minimal attraction for insects, enabling bats to behave the same way as if it was full darkness and preventing lit roads to act as borders or obstacles to be crossed at night.\n\nAdditionally, through our carbon offsetting projects and partnership with South Pole, we contribute to conserving and restoring forests, safeguarding biodiversity in different regions of the world. For example, our project in Zimbabwe ensures that 785,000 hectares of forest and wildlife on the southern shores of Zimbabwe's Lake Kariba are now being protected. Our reforestation project in Colombia restored 14,484 hectares of forest. Based on our methodology for calculating societal impact, we created EUR 45 million for society through conserving and restoring forest in 2020.\n\n## 16.4.8 Environmental incidents\n\nIn 2020, Signify experienced no significant environmental incidents.",

When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the organization.\n\nWe have agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements which are identified during the audit and which in our view must be reported on quantitative or qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.\n\n## Our scope for the group audit of the financial statements\n\nSignify N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Signify N.V.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for\n\ngroup entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit engagement were performed remotely. The review of audit work papers of component teams was facilitated by having remote access to component teams' electronic audit file platforms, by screen sharing and obtaining copies of work papers directly from the component teams. We increased the frequency and attendance of our interactions with component teams.\n\nFollowing our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to Signify N.V.'s consolidated financial statements, we have selected 2 components which required an audit of the complete financial information (Full Scope Component). We have selected 26 components requiring audit procedures on specific account balances that we considered to have the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile (Specific Scope Components). We used the work of other EY member firms when auditing entities outside the Netherlands. We centrally performed audit procedures on accounting areas which are managed centrally such as goodwill, legal claims and treasury.",

Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe performed the following procedures in order to identify and assess the risks of going concern and to conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting. Management made a specific assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated the assessment with management exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism, and specifically focusing on the process followed by management to make\n\ngroup's financial information to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Teaming, use of specialists and internal audit\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in Signify's industry. We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury and income tax and have made use of our own experts in the areas of valuations and actuaries.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and noncompliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the Company that may have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nIn order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity's internal control relevant to the audit and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal control. We do not audit internal control per se for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control.\n\nWe considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors (including internal audit, legal, compliance and heads of Market Groups and Divisions) and the Supervisory Board. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. As Signify N.V. is a global company, operating in multiple jurisdictions, we considered the risk of bribery and corruption.\n\nIn our process of identifying fraud risks, we considered whether the COVID-19 pandemic gives rise to specific fraud risk factors resulting from a dilution in the effectiveness of controls as a result of the general disruption associated with remote working, illness and workforce reductions, supply chain failures and pressure to make\n\nemergency procurements, management overrides and workarounds becoming the norm, manual invoicing and manual payments, abuse of government schemes intended to support companies during the pandemic, management under pressure to meet financial targets, to demonstrate that the actions to limit exposure to losses have been successful, or to meet certain KPIs necessary to qualify for debt financing or meeting debt covenants. Conversely, we also consider whether management has over-provided in their reserves in the current period when expecting poor results with a view to release excess provisions in future periods.\n\nWe evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks. In addition, we performed procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in the Notes to the financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. If so, we reevaluate our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on our audit procedures.",

We consider based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\n\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit procedures for the financial statements and the sustainability information. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nThe key audit matter 'Valuation of deferred tax assets', which was included in our 2019 audit, has been changed to 'Valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities for uncertain tax positions' in our 2020 audit as our audit procedures confirmed an increase in estimation uncertainty regarding the liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\n\nThe acquisition of Cooper Lighting Solutions resulted in the identification of a new key audit matter.\n\nThe key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit procedures for the financial statements and the sustainability information as a whole and to conclude thereon, and we do not provide a separate conclusion on these matters.",

These are commonly referred to as non-IFRS financial measures and include items such as comparable sales growth, adjusted gross margin, EBITA, Adjusted EBITA, free cash flow and other related ratios.\n\nAlthough the non-IFRS financial measures presented are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS, the company uses these measures to monitor the underlying performance of its business and operations. These measures have not been audited or reviewed by the company's external auditor. Furthermore, these measures may not be indicative of the company's historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the company's future results. These measures are presented in this Annual Report because the company considers them an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which it operates, as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity.\n\n## Changes to Financial Reporting\n\nAs of Q2 2020, Signify changed its organizational structure (for more details refer to note 1, Basis of preparation, of this Annual Report).

The company also believes that the presentation of EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio provide useful information to investors on the development of the company's business and enhance the ability of investors to compare profitability across the Divisions. In the case of EBITA, the company believes that it makes the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out the amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill, which arises when acquisitions are consolidated by the company. In the case of Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio, the company believes that these measures make the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental charges which are not directly related to the operational performance of a Division. EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio are also used by the company as key financial measures to assess the operating performance of the Divisions.\n\n## Adjusted EBITA to Income from operations (EBIT) in millions of EUR\n\n|                                  | Signify   | Digital  Solutions   | Digital  Products   | Conven- tional  Products   | Signify  Other   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| 2020                             |           |                      |                     |                            |                  |\n| Adjusted EBITA                   | 695       | 330                  | 295                 | 170                        | (100)            |\n| Restructuring                    | (83)      | (30)                 | (10)                | (23)                       | (19)             |\n| Acquisition-related charges      | (63)      | (62)                 | (1)                 | 0                          | 0                |\n| Incidental items                 | (13)      | (8)                  | (6)                 | 3                          | (1)              |\n| EBITA                            | 536       | 230                  | 277                 | 149                        | (120)            |\n| Amortization  1                  | (120)     | (111)                | (8)                 | -                          | (1)              |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)  2 | 416       | 119                  | 269                 | 149                        | (122)            |\n\n## 2019\n\n| Adjusted EBITA                   | 648   | 265   | 260   | 222   | (100)   |\n|----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Restructuring                    | (99)  | (22)  | (19)  | (44)  | (14)    |\n| Acquisition-related charges      | (13)  | (9)   | (3)   | 0     | 0       |\n| Incidental items                 | (36)  | (11)  | (16)  | (10)  | 1       |\n| EBITA                            | 500   | 222   | 222   | 168   | (112)   |\n| Amortization  1                  | (99)  | (90)  | (7)   | 0     | (2)     |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)  2 | 401   | 133   | 215   | 168   | (114)   |\n\n- 1 Amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill.\n- 2 For a reconciliation to income before taxes, refer to note 3, Information by segment and main country, of this Annual Report.\n\n## Comparable sales growth\n\nThe company discloses comparable sales growth as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure, as the company believes that the presentation of comparable sales growth is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate the performance of the company's business activities over time. The company determines comparable sales growth by deducting the percentage figures for changes from the nominal change of sales. Interaction effects between currency movements, changes in consolidation, regulatory changes and changes in accounting standards (second order effects) are not taken into account. The company presents comparable sales growth on both a Division and Market Group basis. Comparable sales growth is also used by the company as a key financial measure to assess the operating performance of the Divisions and Market Groups.\n\n## Sales growth composition per business in %\n\n|                       | Compa rable  growth   | Currency   effects   | Consolidation  and other  changes   | Nominal   growth   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Digital Solutions     | (14.4)                | ( 2.1)               | 39.3                                | 22.8               |\n| Digital Products      | ( 8.3)                | ( 2.3)               | 5.5                                 | ( 5.1)             |\n| Conventional Products | ( 16.5)               | ( 2.0)               | (0.2)                               | ( 1 8.7 )          |\n| Signify               | ( 1 2.7 )             | (2.2)                | 19.0                                | 4.1                |\n\n## Sales growth composition per market in %\n\n|                   | Compa rable  growth   | Currency   effects   | Consolidation  and other  changes   | Nominal   growth   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Europe            | ( 6.8)                | (1.0)                | (0.2)                               | ( 7.9 )            |\n| Americas          | ( 15.9)               | ( 2.7 )              | 56.8                                | 38.1               |\n| Rest of the World | ( 16.3)               | (3.0)                | 0.1                                 | ( 19.1)            |\n| Global businesses | ( 7.3 )               | ( 1.6)               | 38.8                                | 29.8               |\n| Signify           | ( 1 2.7 )             | (2.2)                | 19.0                                | 4.1                |\n\n- In 2020 Americas includes Cooper Lighting and Global businesses includes Klite\n\n## EBITA and Adjusted EBITA\n\nThe company discloses EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio as supplemental non-IFRS financial measures, as the company believes these are meaningful measures to evaluate the performance of the company's business activities over time.

This means all products, systems, or services that demonstrate a measurable positive impact in energy efficiency (10% or greater), and preferably in one or more sustainable focal areas: Circularity, Weight & Materials, Packaging, Substances, Human-Centric Lighting, Basic Needs or Access to Light. Sustainable innovation spend is the total spending of all R&D projects contributing to sustainable innovation.\n\n## Sustainable revenues\n\nSustainable revenues are measured as a percentage of total revenues per product category and tracked for each division. Sustainable products, systems or services must demonstrate a measurable positive impact in energy efficiency (10% or greater), the most impactful of our sustainable focal areas. Sustainable revenues are defined as products with an energy efficiency of 66 lm/W and higher as well as all systems and services, as these provide additional energy savings. Sustainable products outperform reference products (predecessor product in the particular product family), or productspecific eco-requirements, or by being awarded with a recognized eco-\n\nperformance label. The lifecycle approach is used to determine the environmental impacts and improvements of our products over their total life cycle (from raw materials, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, product use to disposal). Studies have shown the product use phase being the most important for lighting products.\n\n## Switch\n\nWall mounted devices designed to (i) change the electric connections among its terminals or (ii) engage with the pins of a plug and having terminals for the connection of cables or cords (i.e., socket contacts).\n\n## Total Recordable Case rate\n\nNumber of injuries and illnesses sustained at work that result in medical treatment, restricted work, lost work-days, or fatality, divided by 100 FTEs.\n\n## Weighted average statutory income tax rate\n\nThis weighted average statutory tax rate is the aggregation of the result before tax multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate without adjustment for losses, divided by the company result before tax.\n\n## Working capital\n\nThe sum of Inventories, Trade and other receivables, Other current assets, Derivative financial assets minus the sum of Trade and other payables, Derivative financial liabilities and Other current liabilities.\n\n## Zero waste to landfill\n\nZero waste to landfill refers to manufacturing sites diverting their manufacturing waste to recycling or incineration, instead of to landfill. To determine waste to landfill in scope of our commitment we exclude the following categories: chemical waste, hazardous waste, one-time waste and regulated waste. When more than 99% of the total operational waste generated from a site is diverted from landfill, a site is considered to qualify as sending 'zero waste to landfill'.",

For further information on non-IFRS financial measures, see chapter 18, Reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures, of this Annual Report.\n\n## Fair value information\n\nIn presenting Signify's financial position, fair values are used for the measurement of various items in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These fair values are based on market prices, where available, and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable. Readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid on the balance sheet date. When quoted prices or observable market values do not exist, fair values are estimated using valuation models, which we believe are appropriate for their purpose. They require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments which are inherently uncertain and may therefore\n\ndeviate from actual developments. Critical assumptions used are disclosed in the financial statements. In certain cases, independent valuations are obtained to support management's determination of fair values.\n\n## IFRS basis of presentation\n\nThe financial information included in this document is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU), as explained in significant accounting policies, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Statutory financial statements\n\nChapter 14, Consolidated financial statements and chapter 15, Signify N.V. financial statements, of this Annual Report, contain the statutory financial statements of Signify N.V.\n\n## Regulated information\n\nThis document contains regulated information within the meaning of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.",
