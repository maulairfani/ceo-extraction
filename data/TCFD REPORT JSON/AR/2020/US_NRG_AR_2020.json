        "page_content": "## Item 1 - Business\n\n## General\n\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is an integrated power company built on dynamic retail brands with diverse generation assets.  NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, in major competitive power and gas markets in the U.S. and Canada in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders.  NRG  is  a  customer-centric  business  focused  on  perfecting  the  integrated  model  by  balancing  retail  load  with generation  supply  within  its  deregulated  markets.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Company  sold  energy,  services,  and innovative, sustainable products and services directly to retail customers under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Green Mountain Energy, Stream, and XOOM Energy, as well as other brand names owned by NRG, supported by approximately 23,000 MW of generation.\n\nNRG also conducts business under the brand name of Direct Energy as a result of the Company's acquisition of Direct Energy,  a  North  American  subsidiary  of  Centrica  plc,  on  January  5,  2021.  Direct  Energy  is  a  leading  retail  provider  of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. In addition, Direct Energy is a participant in the wholesale gas and power markets in the United States and Canada. See Item 15 -Note 4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Direct Energy.\n\nOn February 28, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight  Capital  Partners,  to  sell  approximately  4,850  MWs  of  fossil  generating  assets  from  its  East  and  West  regions  of operations for total proceeds of $760 million, subject to standard purchase price adjustments and certain other indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG is entering into a tolling agreement for its 866 MW Arthur Kill plant in New York City through April  2025.  The  transaction  is  expected  to  close  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  and  is  subject  to  various  closing  conditions, approvals and consents, including FERC, NYSPSC, and antitrust review under Hart-Scott-Rodino.\n\nThe  Company  has  achieved  the  targets  related  to  operations  and  cost  excellence,  portfolio  optimization,  and  capital structure  and  allocation  enhancement,  as  set  out  by  the  Transformation  Plan.  See  Item  7  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations for further discussion.\n\n## Strategy\n\nNRG's strategy is to maximize stakeholder value through the safe production and sale of reliable power and gas to its customers  in  the  markets  it  serves,  while  positioning  the  Company  to  provide  innovative  solutions  to  the  end-use  energy customer. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to optimize its integrated model to generate stable and predictable cash flow, significantly strengthen earnings and cost competitiveness, and lower risk and volatility.\n\nTo effectuate the Company's strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale customers in competitive markets through multiple brands and channels; (ii) offering a variety of energy products and services,  including  renewable  energy  solutions,  that  are  differentiated  by  innovative  features,  premium service, sustainability, and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) excellence in operating performance of its existing assets; (iv) optimal hedging of NRG's portfolio; and (v) engaging in disciplined and transparent capital allocation.\n\nSustainability is an integral piece of NRG's strategy and ties directly to business success, reduced risks and brand value. In 2019, NRG announced the acceleration of its science-based GHG emissions reduction goals to align with prevailing climate science,  limiting  global  warming  in  the  post-industrial  era  to  1.5  degree  Celsius.  Under  its  new  GHG  emissions  reduction timeline,  NRG  is  targeting  a  50%  reduction  by  2025,  from  its  current  2014  baseline,  and  net-zero  emissions  by  2050.  The Company is on track to meet its 2025 goal.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nThe Company's core business is the sale of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers, supported by the Company's wholesale generation.\n\nAs part of perfecting the integrated model, in which the majority of the Company's generation serves its retail customers, the Company began managing its operations based on the combined results of the retail and wholesale generation businesses with a geographical focus in 2020. As a result, the Company changed its business segments from Retail and Generation to Texas,  East  and  West/Other  beginning  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020.  The  Company's  updated  segment  structure  reflects  how management makes financial decisions and allocates resources.\n\nThe Company's business is segregated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas;\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 East, which includes the remaining activity related to customer operations and all activity related to plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Other, which includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to plant and market operations in the West, (ii) activity related to the Cottonwood power plant that was sold to Cleco on February 4, 2019 and is being leased back until 2025, (iii) the remaining renewables activity, including the Company's equity method investments in Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC and Agua Caliente (which was sold on February 3, 2021) and the NFL stadium solar generating assets, and (iv) activity related to the Company's equity method investment for the Gladstone power plant in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the vast majority of the Company's business was in Texas, where the Company's generation supply is fully integrated with its retail load. In the East, the Company's retail load is more dispersed throughout the region and not fully integrated with the Company's generation supply due to the locations of its power plants in that region. In the West, the Company's business is primarily generation supply. The acquisition of Direct Energy broadens the Company's presence in the  Northeast  and  into  states  and  locales  where  it  did  not  previously  operate,  supporting  NRG's  objective  to  diversify  its business.\n\nThe acquired operations of Direct Energy will be integrated into the existing NRG segment structure. Domestic customer and market operations will be combined into the corresponding geographical segments of Texas, East and West/Other. The East segment will also include the deregulated customer and market operations of Canada. The West/Other segment will also include activity related to the regulated operations in Alberta, Canada and the services businesses.\n\nThe Company's integrated model consists of three core functions: Customer Operations, Market Operations and Plant Operations,  which  directly  support  each  other  in  each  geographic  region.  The  Company's  integrated  model  provides  the advantage of being able to supply the Company's retail customers with electricity from the Company's assets, which reduces the need to sell electricity to and buy electricity from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in stable earnings and cash flows, lower transaction costs and less credit exposure. The integrated model also results in a reduction in actual and contingent collateral through offsetting transactions, thereby minimizing transactions with third parties.\n\nNRG provides energy and related services to residential, industrial and commercial, and wholesale customers at either fixed, indexed or month-to-month prices through various brands and sales channels across the U.S. and Canada. Residential and small  commercial  (\"Mass  market\")  customers  typically  contract  for  terms  ranging  from  one  month  to  five  years,  while industrial and large commercial (\"C&I\") contracts are often between one year and five years in length. NRG sold approximately 68.2  TWhs  of  electricity  and  23.5  MMDth  of  natural  gas  in  2020  and  served  approximately  3.6  million  customers  as  of December 31, 2020, making it one of the largest competitive energy retailers in the U.S. In any given year, the quantity of TWhs and MMDth sold can be affected by weather, economic conditions and competition. As of the end of 2020, NRG had recurring electricity and/or natural gas sales in 19 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and 2 provinces in Canada. Following the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy,  NRG  has  recurring  electricity  and/or  natural  gas  sales  in  24  U.S.  states,  the  District  of Columbia,  and  8  provinces  in  Canada.  NRG's  retail  brands,  collectively,  have  the  largest  share  of  competitively  served residential electric customers in Texas and nationwide.",

        "page_content": "The charts below illustrate NRG's U.S. retail capabilities, power generation and net capacity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Extreme Weather Event in Texas During February 2021\n\nDuring February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration, resulting in a power emergency,  blackouts,  and  an  estimated  all-time  peak  demand  of  77  GWs  (without  load  shed).  Ahead  of  the  event,  NRG launched residential  customer  communications calling for  conservation  across  all  of  its  brands,  and  initiated  residential  and commercial and industrial demand response programs to curtail customer load. The Company maximized available generating capacity and brought in additional resources to supplement in-state staff with technical and operating experts from the rest of its U.S. fleet. NRG is committed to working with all necessary stakeholders on a comprehensive, objective, and exhaustive root cause analysis of the entirety of the energy system.\n\nThe estimated financial impact is still preliminary, due to customer meter and settlement data not being finalized, as well as potential customer and counterparty risk and expected ERCOT default allocations. Based on a preliminary analysis, Winter Storm Uri's financial impact is not expected to be adverse to NRG's financial results. The Company separately stress-tested assumptions and although at a lower probability, this stress-test analysis indicated a potential plus or minus $100 million to income  from  continuing  operations  in  2021.  NRG's  integrated  platform  continues  to  deliver  stable  results  through unprecedented events.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nIn  March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic and the President of the United States  declared  the  COVID-19  outbreak  a  national  emergency.  Electricity  was  deemed  a  'critical  and  essential  business operation' under various state and federal governmental COVID-19 mandates.\n\nNRG has been and continues to remain focused on protecting the health and well-being of its employees, while supporting its  customers  and  the  communities  in  which  it  operates  and  assuring  the  continuity  of  its  operations.  During  2020,  NRG contributed  $2  million  to  COVID-19  relief  efforts,  including  funding  for  urgently  needed  safety  equipment  supporting  first responders,  as  well  as  funds  that  aided  local  communities  and  teachers.  The  Company  also  allocated  funding  to  the  NRG Employee Relief Fund to assist employees adversely impacted by natural disasters and other extraordinary events.\n\nNRG activated its Crisis Management Team (\"CMT\") in January 2020, which proactively began managing the Company's response to the impacts of COVID-19. The CMT implemented the business continuity plans for the Company and had taken a variety  of  measures  to  ensure  the  ongoing  availability  of  the  Company's  services,  while  maintaining  the  Company's commitment to its core values of health and safety. Pursuant to the Company's Infectious Disease & Pandemic Policy, in March 2020, NRG implemented restrictions on business travel and face-to-face sales channels, instituted remote work practices and enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its offices and facilities.\n\nIn order to effectively serve the Company's customers, select essential employees and contractors continued to report to plant and certain office locations. In June 2020, summer-critical office employees also returned to the offices.",

        "page_content": "The Company requires pre-entry screening, including temperature checks, separation of work crews, additional personal protective equipment for employees and contractors when social distancing cannot be maintained, and a ban on all non-essential visitors.  As  a  result  of  these  business  continuity  measures,  the  Company has not experienced any material disruptions in its ability  to  continue  its  business  operations  to  date.  The  first  COVID-19  vaccine  became  available  in  the  United  States  in December 2020. NRG continues to advocate alongside state and federal trade groups for the high prioritization of essential electric  industry  personnel  for  inoculation  against  COVID-19.  States  are  receiving  weekly  doses  of  vaccines  and  allocating those  doses  to  frontline  healthcare  workers,  elderly  populations  and  high  risk  individuals.  NRG  continues  to  monitor  state information  as  well  as  dosage  and  allocation  numbers  to  anticipate  the  latest  timing  of  vaccine  distribution  to  our  essential employees. The Company will continue to evaluate additional return to normal work operations on a location-by-location basis as COVID-19 conditions evolve.\n\nThe  Company  continues  to  utilize  the  communication  protocol  established  in  January  2020,  including  a  central information hub on its intranet. The Company has provided additional wellness programs to support employees through the pandemic, including no-cost access to telehealth services, a mindfulness and meditation program, center or home-based backup child and elder care, and access to the Company's Emergency Relief Fund for financially impacted employees.\n\nFollowing the President's declaration of COVID-19 outbreak as a national emergency in March 2020, the Governors of the majority of states in which the Company operates issued executive orders that every person should, except where necessary to provide or obtain essential services, minimize social gatherings and minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household. The impact of these orders affected energy loads due to closed schools, restaurants and bars, except in certain cases for takeout, and other non-essential businesses. As state restrictions have been eased or lifted, loads have begun to recover in those markets in which the Company operates. The rebound in demand has varied across the Company's market footprint,  as  restrictions  vary  regionally.  During  2020,  the  Company  experienced  increased  demand  from  its  residential portfolio as many people remained at home, while the load for small businesses and C&I customers decreased due to reduced economic activity. The Company expects similar demand trends to continue in the near future. These restrictions have also created limitations to the Company's face-to-face sales channels and are expected to negatively impact the Company's customer count  primarily  in  the  East  region.  As  the  COVID-19  vaccine  is  distributed  and  the  spread  of  transmission  decreases,  the Company would anticipate changes to the previously disclosed restrictions.\n\nIn Texas, the PUCT adopted the COVID-19 Electricity Relief Program ('ERP') to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on Texas retail  electric  customers  experiencing  economic  hardship  as  a  result  of  the  pandemic.  The  COVID-19  ERP  provided temporary disconnection protection for eligible customers and established funds to offset some of the costs incurred by retail electric providers that continued service to those customers. The COVID-19 ERP disconnection protection and benefits ended on September 30, 2020. Consistent with the PUCT's orders, NRG is continuing to offer deferred payment plans to all residential and small commercial customers while the declaration of emergency in Texas is in place.\n\nWhile the pandemic presented risks, as further described in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, to the Company's  business,  there  was  not  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations  for  the  year  ended December  31,  2020.  NRG  believes  it  has  sufficient  liquidity  on  hand  to  continue  business  operations  in  light  of  current circumstances  posed  by  the  pandemic.  As  disclosed  in  the  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  section,  the  Company  has  total available  liquidity  of  $7.0  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020,  consisting  of  cash  on  hand,  its  Revolving  Credit  Facility  and additional facilities.\n\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material adverse impact on the Company exists as long as the virus impacts the level of economic activity in the United States and abroad. The Company expects the risk to decrease in the future as vaccinations are administered. NRG cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the full impact  COVID-19,  and  any  resurgence  of  COVID-19,  may  have  on  the  Company's  future  results  of  operations,  financial position, and liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company's business, operating results, financial  condition,  risk  exposure  or  liquidity  will  depend  on  future  developments,  including  the  duration  of  the  pandemic, travel restrictions, business and workforce disruptions, any resurgence of the pandemic and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain, mitigate and treat the disease. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Customer Operations\n\nCustomer Operations is responsible for growing and retaining the customer base and delivering an outstanding customer experience. This includes acquisition and retention of all of NRG's residential, small commercial, government and commercial & industrial customers. NRG employs a multi-brand strategy that leverages a wide array of sales and partnership channels, direct face-to-face sales channels, call centers, websites, and brokers. Go-to-market activities include market strategy planning and development, product innovation, offer design, campaign execution, marketing and creative services, and selling. Customer portfolio  maintenance and retention activities  include  fulfillment,  billing,  payment  processing,  collections,  customer  service, issue resolution, and contract renewals. Throughout all Customer Operations activities, the customer experience is kept at the forefront to inform decision-making and optimize retention, while creating supporters and advocates for NRG's brands in the",

        "page_content": "market.  Following  the  expansion  of  the  customer  base  with  the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy,  Customer  Operations  now comprises  three  end-use  customer  facing  teams:  NRG  Home,  which  serves  Mass  Market  customers,  NRG  Business,  which serves medium and large business customers, and NRG Services, which primarily includes the services businesses acquired.\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nNRG sells a variety of products to residential and small commercial customers, including retail electricity and energy management, natural gas, home security, line and surge protection products, HVAC installation, repair and maintenance, home warranty and protection products, carbon offsets, back-up power stations, portable power, portable solar and portable lighting. Mass market customers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, incentive, customer service, brand, innovative offers/features and referrals from friends and family. Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, NRG is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. NRG's brands are recognized for  exemplary  customer  service,  innovative  smart  energy  and  technology  product  offerings,  and  environmentally-friendly solutions.\n\nThe Company provides power and natural gas to the business-to-business markets in North America, as well as retail services, including demand response, commodity sales, energy efficiency and energy management solutions to C&I customers. The Company is an integrated provider of supply and distributed energy resources and focuses on distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power and/or other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid. These solutions include system power, distributed generation, renewable products, carbon management and specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response, and energy efficiency and advisory services. In providing on-site energy solutions, the Company often benefits from its ability to supply energy products from its wholesale generation portfolio to  C&I  customers.  In  2020,  the  Company  sold  approximately  20  TWhs  of  electricity  to  C&I  customers  and  managed approximately 1,750 MWs of demand response positions across its portfolio.\n\n## Market Operations\n\nMarket Operations has two primary objectives: (i) to supply energy to our customers in the most cost-efficient manner; and (ii) to maximize the value of the Company's assets after satisfying its customer load requirements. These objectives are intended to reduce supply costs and maximize earnings with predictable cash flows.\n\nTo meet these objectives, NRG enters into supply, power and gas sales and hedging arrangements via a wide range of products  and  contracts,  including  (i)  renewable  PPAs,  (ii)  capacity  auctions  and  other  contracted  revenue  sources,  (iii)  fuel supply  and  transportation  contracts,  and  (iv)  physical  and  financial  natural  gas  derivative  instruments  and  other  financial instruments.\n\nIn addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward purchases and sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk.\n\n## Renewable PPAs\n\nDuring 2019, NRG began procuring mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December  31,  2020,  NRG  has  entered  into  PPAs  in  Texas  totaling  approximately  1,800  MWs  with  third-party  project developers  and  other  counterparties.  The  tenor  of  these  agreements  is  an  average  between  eleven  and  twelve  years.  The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing agreements, such as these, that support the needs of the business.\n\n## Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources\n\nNRG's  revenues  and  cash  flows,  primarily  in  the  East  and  West,  benefit  from  capacity/demand  payments  and  other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, resource adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements and other long-term contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM, ISO-NE and NYISO. Both PJM and ISO-NE  operate  a  pay-for-performance  model  where  capacity  payments  are  modified  based  on  real-time  performance  and NRG's actual revenues will be the combination of revenues based on the cleared auction MWs plus the net of any over- and under-performance of NRG's respective generation assets. The Company primarily sells physical and financial capacity forward through  bilateral  contracts  for  our  New  York  state  assets.  To  the  extent  NRG  is  not  able  to  enter  into  physical  bilateral contracts, NRG will sell the remaining capacity into the NYISO six month strip, monthly or spot auctions.\n\n- \u00b7 2024/2025 ISO-NE Auction Results - On February 11, 2020 ISO-NE announced the results of its 2024/2025 forward capacity auction. NRG cleared 1,518 MW of capacity. NRG's expected capacity revenues from the auction for the 2024/2025 delivery year are approximately $48 million.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 PJM Auction Results - PJM announced during 2019 it was suspending all auction deadlines relating to Base Residual Auctions for 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 delivery year, consistent with FERC's July 25, 2019 Order. The auctions are now set to resume in 2021. Refer to the Capacity Market Reforms Filing discussion within the Regional Regulatory Developments section below for further discussion.\n\nIn California, there is a resource adequacy requirement that is primarily satisfied through bilateral contracts. Such bilateral contracts  are  typically  short-term  resource  adequacy  contracts.  When  bilateral  contracting  does  not  satisfy  the  resource adequacy need, such shortfalls can be addressed through procurement tools administered by the CAISO, including the capacity procurement mechanism or reliability must-run contracts.\n\n## Fuel Supply and Transportation\n\nNRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels can be volatile. The  Company  obtains  its  fossil  fuels  from  multiple  suppliers  and  through  multiple  transporters.  Although  availability  is generally  not  an  issue,  localized  shortages,  transportation  availability,  delays  arising  from  extreme  weather  conditions  and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are  fairly  uniform  across  the  Company's  business  and  fuel  products  used.  NRG's  primary  fuel  requirements  consist  of  the following:\n\nNatural Gas - NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants across all its U.S. wholesale regions. Fuel needs are managed on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units as the dispatch is highly unpredictable. The Company contracts for natural gas storage services, as well as natural gas transportation services to deliver natural gas when needed.\n\nCoal -  The  Company  believes  it  is  adequately  hedged,  using  forward  coal  supply  agreements,  for  its  domestic  coal consumption for 2021. NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site. As of December 31, 2020, NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately 50% of the  Company's expected requirements for 2021 and 2022 . NRG purchased approximately 11 million tons of coal in 2020, almost all of which was Powder River Basin coal. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures that will provide for most of the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next 2 years.\n\nNuclear  Fuel -  STP's  owners,  including  NRG,  satisfy  their  fuel  supply  requirements  by:  (i)  acquiring  uranium concentrates  and  contracting  for  conversion  of  the  uranium  concentrates  into  uranium  hexafluoride;  (ii)  contracting  for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP that is responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements for uranium concentrates with only approximately 25% of STP's requirements outstanding for the duration of the original operating license. Similarly, NRG is party to long-term contracts to procure STP's requirements for conversion and enrichment  services  and  fuel  fabrication  for  the  life  of  the  operating  license.  Since  the  operating  license  was  renewed  for another 20 years in 2017, STPNOC has begun to review a second phase of fuel purchasing.\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Other Financial Instruments\n\nNRG also  trades  electric  power,  natural  gas  and  related  commodities,  environmental  products,  weather  products  and financial  products,  including  forwards,  futures,  options  and  swaps.  NRG  enters  into  these  instruments  for  many  reasons, including to manage price and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio, manage working capital requirements, reduce the carbon exposure in its business and comply with regulations and laws.\n\n## Plant Operations\n\nThe Company owns a diversified power generation portfolio with approximately 23,000 MW of fossil fuel, nuclear and renewable generation capacity at 33 plants as of December 31, 2020. The Company's power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type,  dispatch  level  and  region,  which  helps  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with  fuel  price  volatility  and  market  demand cycles. NRG continually evaluates its generation portfolio to focus on asset optimization opportunities and the locational value of its generation assets in each of the markets where the Company participates, as well as opportunities for the development of new generation.",

consolidation  in  the  competitive  retail  space  over  the  past  few  years,  there  is  still  considerable competition  for  customers.  In  Texas,  there  is  healthy  competition  in  deregulated  areas  and  customers  can  choose  providers based on the most appealing offers. Outside of Texas, electricity retailers compete with the incumbent utilities, in addition to other retail electric providers, which can inhibit competition, depending on the market rules of the state. There is a high degree of fragmentation, with both large and small competitors offering a range of value propositions, including value, rewards, and sustainability.\n\nWholesale generation is highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure by region. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the Company's competitors depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.",

        "page_content": "## Seasonality and Price Volatility\n\nThe sale of electric power to retail customers is a seasonal business with the demand for power generally peaking during the summer months. In connection with the acquisition of Direct Energy, the Company acquired a large natural gas customer portfolio, which generally experiences peak demand during the winter months. As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer and winter months along with the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months. Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could have a material impact. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices and market dynamics, such as the price of natural gas, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates.\n\nAnnual and quarterly operating results of the Company's generation portfolio can be significantly affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the regions in which the Company operates.\n\n## Market Framework\n\nNRG sells electricity, natural gas and related products and services to customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. In most of the states and regions that have introduced retail consumer choice, NRG competitively offers electricity, natural gas, portable power and other value-enhancing services to customers. Each retail consumer choice state or province establishes its own retail competition  laws  and  regulations,  and  the  specific  operational,  licensing,  and  compliance  requirements  vary  by  state  or province.  Regulated  terms  and  conditions  of  default  service,  as  well  as  any  movement  to  replace  default  service  with competitive  services,  as  is  done  in  ERCOT,  can  affect  customer  participation  in  retail  competition.  In  Canada,  NRG  sells energy and related services to residential and commercial customers in the province of Alberta pursuant both to a regulated rate service governed by provincial regulations as well as a competitive service with rates set by market forces. Sales of energy to commercial customers take place in other provinces as well. The attractiveness of NRG's retail offerings may be impacted by the  rules,  regulations,  market  structure  and  communication  requirements  from  public  utility  commissions  in  each  state  and province.\n\nNRG's fleet  operates  in  organized  energy  markets,  known  as  RTOs  or  ISOs.  Each  organized  market  administers  dayahead and real-time centralized bid-based energy and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market  participants  make  bilateral  sales  with  one  another,  and  how  entities  with  market-based  rates  are  compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates.\n\nOther  than  ERCOT,  each  of  the  ISO  regions  also  operates  a  capacity  or  resource  adequacy  market  that  provides  an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations.\n\n## Texas\n\nNRG's  business  in  Texas  is  subject  to  standards  and  regulations  adopted  by  the  PUCT  and  ERCOT (a) ,  including  the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. The ERCOT market is  one  of  the  nation's  largest  and,  historically,  fastest  growing  power  markets.  ERCOT  is  an  energy-only  market  and  has implemented  market  rule  changes  referred  to  as  the  Operating  Reserve  Demand  Curve  (ORDC)  to  provide  pricing  more reflective of higher energy value when operating reserves are scarce or constrained. The PUCT directed the implementation of the ORDC in 2014 to act as the primary scarcity pricing mechanism, with subsequent amendments made in 2019 and 2020. The majority of the retail load in the ERCOT market region is served by competitive retail suppliers, except certain areas that have not opted into competitive consumer choice and are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives.\n\n## East\n\nWhile most of the states in the East region have introduced some level of retail consumer choice for electricity and/or natural  gas,  the  incumbent  utilities  currently  provide  default  service  in  most  of  the  states  and  as  a  result  typically  serve  the majority of residential customers. NRG's retail activities in the East are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the ISOs and state public utility commissions, including the requirement for retailers to be certified in each state in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity.",

        "page_content": "NRG's power plants and demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of ISONE, MISO, NYISO and PJM. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, the East region receives a significant portion of its revenues from capacity markets. PJM and ISO-NE use a three-year forward capacity auction, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction. MISO has an annual auction, known as the Planning Resource Auction. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance. In such markets, NRG's actual capacity revenues will be the combination  of  cleared  auction  prices  times  the  quantity  of  MWs  cleared,  plus  the  net  of  any  over-performance  \"bonus payments\" and any under-performance charges. Additionally, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids.\n\n## West\n\nIn the West region of the U.S., NRG operates a fleet of natural gas-fired power plants located entirely within the CAISO footprint. The CAISO operates day-ahead and real-time locational markets for energy and ancillary services, while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity products  at  market-based  rates,  either  within  the  CAISO's  centralized  energy  and  ancillary  service  markets  or  bilaterally pursuant  to  tolling  arrangements  or  other  capacity  sales  with  California's  LSEs.  The  CPUC  also  determines  capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas.  Additionally,  the  CAISO  has  independent  authority  to  contract  with  needed  resources  under  certain  circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly.\n\n## Canada\n\nIn Canada, NRG sells to residential and commercial retail customers in Alberta under both regulated rates approved by the AUC as well as through competitive service with rates set by the market. The Company's regulated rates are approved through periodic  rate  applications  that  establish  rates  for  power  and  gas  sales  as  well  as  for  recovery  of  other  costs  associated  with operating the regulated business. In addition, the Company conducts retail sales of energy to commercial customers in other provinces. All sales and operations are subject to applicable federal and provincial laws, regulations and licensing requirements.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nAs participants in wholesale and retail energy markets and owners and operators of power plants, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generation or distributed generation assets are located. In addition,  NRG  is  subject  to  the  market  rules,  procedures  and  protocols  of  the  various  ISO  and  RTO  markets  in  which  it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the  states  and  provinces  in  which  NRG  entities  are  licensed  to  sell  at  retail.  NRG  must  also  comply  with  the  mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.\n\nSince entering office in January 2021, the President has signed a package of executive orders which, amongst other things, intends  to  boost  the  federal  government's  response  to  COVID-19,  as  well  as  elevate  climate  change  across  all  levels  and jurisdictions  of  the  federal  government.  The  administration  has  requested  all  agencies  delay  submitting  rules  to  the  Federal Register or posting their effective date for 60 days if not already effective, until they can be reviewed by appointees of the current administration. NRG is closely monitoring agency action as the orders will likely result in the promulgation of new regulations, where applicable.\n\nNRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.\n\n## Federal Energy Regulation\n\nD.C. Circuit Ruling on FERC's Use of Tolling Orders On June 30, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision stating that FERC's ability to \"toll\" actions on rehearing beyond the statutory 30-day period is unlawful. On September 17, 2020, FERC staff explained that in Federal Power Act cases, it will no longer issue tolling orders but instead will issue either a Notice of Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law or a Notice of Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law and Providing for Further Consideration. The first indicates that FERC would not intend to issue a merits order and the second indicates that FERC intends to issue further action. This decision impacts an array of appeals related to the PJM MOPR order and will impact how rehearings are decided and appeals filed.",

        "page_content": "## State and Provincial Energy Regulation\n\nState  Proceedings  Regarding  States'  Participation  in  the  Wholesale  Market  Various  states,  including  Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York as well as the District of Columbia have initiated proceedings to investigate resource adequacy alternatives  and  to  consider  its  participation  in  the  regional  wholesale  electricity  market  constructs,  specifically  withdrawal from the regional market or implementing a Fixed Resource Requirement Regime. Any actions taken by the states could affect market design and market prices in the respective regional markets.\n\n## Regional Regulatory Developments\n\nNRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 -  Note 25, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## East/West\n\n## PJM\n\nCapacity Market Reforms Filing -On December 19, 2019, FERC issued an order on the pending proposals to reform the PJM market to mitigate subsidized resources in the capacity market. FERC directed PJM to apply the Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, to new and existing resources receiving state subsidies and subject them to default offer floor prices in their capacity bids. The Order provided for various category specific exemptions to the MOPR, as well as a unit specific exemption, which permits any resource that can justify an offer lower than the default offer price floor to submit such capacity bids to PJM for review. After subsequent filings and orders, on November 13, 2020, PJM submitted its third compliance filing, including a timeline to hold the next Base Residual Auction for Delivery Year 2022-2023 on May 19-25, 2021, which was accepted by FERC. Multiple parties filed appeals in this matter, which have been consolidated at the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Subjecting  subsidized  resources  to  default  offer  floors  in  the  capacity  market  should  protect  the  market  from  further  price suppression. The impact of these changes on capacity market outcomes depends on, among other factors, bidding behavior, load forecast changes, new resource entry, and existing resource exit.\n\nIndiana Municipal Power Agency and City of Lawrenceburg, Indiana Complaint on Station Power On September 17, 2020, FERC issued an order in response to a complaint and request for declaratory judgement challenging the station power wholesale netting provisions in PJM's tariff. FERC found that it does not have jurisdiction over the supply of station power and the provision of station power is a retail sale subject to state jurisdiction. The order established a Section 206 proceeding and required  PJM to  submit  a  filing  within  60  days  to  show  why  the  station  service  netting  provisions  of  its  tariff  are  just  and reasonable. Lawrenceburg Power, LLC filed for rehearing, which was denied by operation of law on November 19, 2020 and they subsequently appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The matter is pending. On November 23, 2020, PJM submitted its station power compliance filing to FERC. Multiple parties filed  comments  and protests to PJM's compliance filing. This decision could affect the rates that plants pay for station power.\n\nPJM's  ORDC  Filing  and  Compliance  Directives -  On  March  29,  2019,  PJM  proposed  energy  and  reserve  market reforms to enhance price formation in reserve markets, which includes modifying its ORDC and aligning market-based reserve product in Day-Ahead and Real-Time markets. On May 21, 2020, FERC approved PJM's proposed energy and reserve market reforms. FERC also directed PJM to implement a forward-looking Energy and Ancillary Services Offset to be used in PJM's capacity markets. PJM submitted a compliance filing to revise its tariff on August 5, 2020. On November 12, 2020, FERC approved two PJM compliance filings regarding PJM's reserve markets and the forward-looking Energy and Ancillary Services Offset and subsequently issued a timeline to hold the Base Residual Auction as noted above. PJM will implement the forwardlooking Energy and Ancillary Services Offset for the 2022/2023 Base Residual Auction.\n\n## New England\n\nISO-NE Inventoried Energy Compensation Proposal - FERC approved ISO-NE's  proposed interim measure to address near-term fuel security concerns by operation of law. After an appeal to the Court of Appeals and a remand back to FERC, FERC  issued  an  order  accepting  Inventoried  Energy  Compensation  Proposal  and  by  operation  of  law  denied  requests  for rehearing on August 20, 2020. Multiple parties filed amended petitions for review to include FERC's order on remand. ISONE's proposal will affect future capacity market prices and the compensation that fuel secure units receive.\n\nMystic's Complaint on Transmission Reliability Review -  On June 10, 2020, Constellation Mystic Power LLC filed a complaint at FERC against ISO-NE alleging that ISO-NE violated its Tariff in its addition of language to its planning procedure and  in  its  conduct  in  carrying  out  a  competitive  transmission  REP  to  address  the  retirements  of  Mystic  Units  8  and  9.  On August 17, 2020, FERC issued an order denying the complaint. After a rehearing that was denied by operation of law, on January 4, 2021, Constellation Mystic Power LLC filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit. The outcome of this proceeding affects the retirement of the Mystic Units 8 and 9, thereby affecting capacity prices in ISO-NE.",

        "page_content": "Paper Hearing on ISO-NE's New Entrant Rule -  On July 1, 2020, FERC issued an order establishing a Section 206 hearing initiated by FERC's preliminary finding that the \"new entrant rules\" may be unjust and unreasonable, specifically as it relates  to  the  seven-year  price-lock  rule  as  a  result  of  the  D.C.  Circuit  Court's  remand  on  a  FERC  Order.  The  price-lock mechanism permits qualified new resources that clear the auction to receive their first-year clearing price for seven years. On December 1, 2020, FERC issued an order eliminating the seven-year price lock rule beginning in Forward Capacity Auction 16. The elimination of the seven-year price lock rule could affect future capacity prices in ISO-NE.\n\nCompetitive Auctions with Sponsored Resources Proposal (CASPR) -  On  January 8, 2018, ISO-NE filed the CASPR proposal  which  attempts  to  accommodate  state  sponsored  resources  while  maintaining  competitive  market  pricing.  On November  19,  2020,  FERC  upheld  the  order  approving  CASPR.  Multiple  parties  filed  an  appeal  to  the  D.C.  Circuit.  The outcome of this proceeding will potentially affect future capacity market prices.\n\n## New York\n\nNew York State Public Service Commission Retail Energy Market Proceedings -On February 23, 2016, the NYSPSC issued an order referred to as the Retail Reset Order. Among other things, the Retail Reset Order placed a price cap on energy supply offers and imposed burdensome new regulations on ESCO's. Various parties have challenged the NYSPSC's authority to regulate prices charged by competitive suppliers. On May 9, 2019 the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest tribunal, issued  a  decision  affirming  the  NYSPSC's  authority  to  regulate  ESCO's  prices  as  a  condition  of  access  to  the  utilities' infrastructure. On December 12, 2019, the NYSPSC issued an order limiting ESCO's offers for electric and natural gas to three compliant products: guaranteed savings from the utility default rate, a fixed term capped at 5% of the rolling 12-month average utility  default  rate,  or  NY-sourced  renewable  energy  that  is  at  least  50%  greater  than  the  prevailing  NY  Renewable  Energy Standard for load serving entities. The Order effectively limited ESCO offers to natural gas customers to only the guaranteed savings and capped fixed term compliant products because no equivalent renewable energy product exists for natural gas. The Order  also  establishes  new  ESCO  eligibility  criteria  and  certification  process,  as  well  as  re-certification  of  current  ESCOs. Multiple parties filed for rehearing, which were denied. After extension requests, the NYSPSC ordered compliance effective April 16, 2021. On January 21, 2021, the NYSPSC issued an Order setting a timeline to evaluate additional compliant energyrelated  value-added  products  and  also  provided  for  a  limited  one-year  waiver  whereby  ESCOs,  including  NRG's  Green Mountain Energy and XOOM Energy, which currently offer green gas products, could continue to serve existing customers. The limited offerings imposed by the Order, as issued, may impact the Company's retail sales to Mass Market customers in New York, although the Company is currently in the process of moving existing customers to compliant products.\n\nNew York Buyer Side Mitigation Proceedings On February 20, 2020, FERC issued multiple orders pertaining to the NYISO capacity market. The orders narrowed certain exemptions to buyer side mitigation measures. Specifically, FERC stated that certain renewable and self-supply resources would be exempt from offer floor mitigation but rejected NYISO's proposal of a 1,000 MW cap on renewable resources that could qualify for the exemption. FERC ordered NYISO to make a compliance filing narrowly tailoring its cap. The NYISO submitted its compliance filing, which FERC largely accepted. FERC rejected a complaint  to  exempt  new  electric  storage  resources  and  also  rejected  a  blanket  exemption  to  demand  response  providers currently subject to mitigation but granted a request for new demand response to receive a blanket exemption from the buyer side mitigation measures. On June 18, 2020, the NYSPSC filed petitions for review with the D.C. Circuit regarding these buyer side  mitigation  orders,  but  the  appeals  were  held  in  abeyance  pending  FERC's  consideration  of  rehearing  requests.  On December 7, 2020, FERC denied rehearings by operation of law regarding the exemption to demand response providers. FERC sustained  its  position  in  an  October  15,  2020  order  regarding  the  rehearing  on  electric  storage  resources.  Parties  have  reappealed  the  order  regarding  electric  storage  resources.  Implementation  of  buyer  side  mitigation  measures  to  address  price suppression provides more accurate capacity price signals in the competitive market.\n\nNew York Generators' Complaint on Buyer Side Mitigation Rules -  On October 14, 2020, two New York generators, Cricket Valley and Empire Generating, filed a complaint at FERC against the NYISO arguing that the NYISO's offer floor rules are unjust and unreasonable because they do not address price suppression in the market. The complaint requests that FERC order the NYISO to implement a MOPR that covers out-of-market support to new and existing resources, similar to that in PJM. The outcome of this proceeding could affect capacity market prices in New York. The complaint remains pending at FERC.\n\n## Texas\n\nPublic  Utility  Commission  of  Texas'  Actions  Related  to  COVID-19  On  March  26,  2020,  the  PUCT  adopted  the COVID-19 Electricity  Relief  Program  (\"ERP\")  aimed  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  residential  customers  in  the competitive retail electric market who are experiencing economic hardship as a result of the pandemic. The COVID-19 ERP protected residential customers deemed eligible by the PUCT's third party administrator from disconnection for nonpayment until September 30, 2020 and established an emergency fund to allow Retail Electric Providers (\"REPs\") to recover a certain amount of credit losses incurred while continuing to serve these customers. Final reimbursement requests by REPs were due by November 30, 2020.",

        "page_content": "## California\n\nCalifornia  Resource  Adequacy  Proceedings -  Since  a  summer  2020  heat  storm  that  resulted  in  emergency  load curtailments,  the  State  of  California  and  CAISO  have  embarked  on  numerous  new  regulatory  activities  while  redirecting existing  proceedings  related  to  the  topic  of  resource  adequacy.  In  a  rulemaking  docket,  on  December  28,  2020,  the  CPUC directed the state's major investor-owned utilities to engage in emergency procurement for 2021 and 2022.  In the same docket, the CPUC is considering ways to increase the volume of demand response available to the state during emergency conditions. The CPUC is also considering longer term structural reforms of the resource adequacy policy in California. Additionally, the CAISO has indicated it will procure resources to a higher reserve margin in 2021 than it employed in 2020, while evaluating the conditions likely to exist at early-evening hours when peak load, net of solar resources, is highest.\n\nMidway-Sunset  RMR  Proceeding  San  Joaquin  Energy,  LLC,  a  subsidiary  of  NRG,  owns  a  50%,  non-controlling interest in the Midway-Sunset Cogeneration Company (\"MSCC\"). MSCC owns a cogeneration facility near Fellows, CA and submitted mothball notices for the cogeneration facility to the CAISO in the latter half of 2020. On December 17, 2020, the CAISO Board effectively rejected the mothball notices by authorizing its staff to designate the MSCC facility as a reliability must-run resource conditioned on execution of a RMR contract. In a letter dated December 16, 2020 sent to the CAISO Board, MSCC indicated that it did not object to the RMR designation but noted certain permitting and maintenance requirements for RMR operation. On January 29, 2021, MSCC made its RMR filing at FERC.\n\n## Canada\n\nAlberta Energy Market - In December 2020, prior to its acquisition by NRG, Direct Energy filed a Non-Energy Rate Application with the AUC to approve cost recovery for the 2020-2022 period. Major cost elements of this application relate to bad debt,  corporate  costs,  and  customer  care  and  billing  contracts.  The  Company  is  engaged  in  a  mediation  and  settlement process.  Typically,  AUC  proceeding  take  12-18  months  to  reach  resolution,  if  settlement  procedures  do  not  result  in  the resolution  of  contested  issues  more  quickly.  The  AUC's  decision  ultimately  will  result  in  a  surcharge  or  rebate  to  adjust collected  revenues  to  AUC-approved  costs  for  the  2020-2022  period.  The  Company  also  is  waiting  on  a  final  review  and approval from the AUC of a negotiated rate settlement for its electricity focused 2020-2022 Energy Price Setting Plan, of which a  decision  is  expected  during  the  first  quarter  of  2021.  The  Company  is  also  in  the  process  of  repaying  the  remainder  of amounts advanced to it from the Balance Pool and the Alberta government as part of its 90 day utility bill deferral program. This  program,  effective  March  18,  2020,  was  designed  to  assist  residential,  farms,  and  small  business  customers  who  were negatively  affected  by  COVID-19  related  economic  circumstances  by  temporarily  deferring  their  utility  bill  payments.  The program was also designed to mitigate bad debt risks associated with the implementation of the program.\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of power plants. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during  operation  of  power  plants.  Federal  and  state  environmental  laws  historically  have  become  more  stringent  over  time. Future  laws  may  require  the  addition  of  emissions  controls  or  other  environmental  controls  or  impose  restrictions  on  the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws often involves specialized human resources and significant capital and  operating  expenses,  as  well  as  occasionally  curtailing  operations.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  may  prevent  the  Company from  complying  with  certain  of  its  environmental  requirements,  which  federal  and  state  regulators  have  recognized.  NRG decides  to  invest  capital  for  environmental  controls  based  on  the  relative  certainty  of  the  requirements,  an  evaluation  of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital.\n\nA  number  of  regulations  that  affect  the  Company  have  been  revised  recently  by  the  EPA,  including  ash  storage  and disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent limitation guidelines. Some of these recent revisions may, in turn, be revised by the new U.S. presidential administration. NRG will evaluate the impact of these regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated revisions and legal challenges are resolved.\n\n## Air\n\nThe  CAA  and  related  regulations  (as  well  as  similar  state  and  local  requirements)  have  the  potential  to  affect  air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO2, ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified  by  the  EPA  as  not  achieving  certain  NAAQS  (non-attainment  areas).  The  relevant  NAAQS  may  become  more stringent.  The  Company  maintains  a  comprehensive  compliance  strategy  to  address  continuing  and  new  requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some  NRG  facilities  or  retiring  of  units  if  installing  such  controls  is  not  economic.  Significant  changes  to  air  regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below.",

        "page_content": "CPP/ACE Rules -The  attention  in  recent  years  on  GHG  emissions  has  resulted  in  federal  and  state  regulations.  In October 2015, the EPA promulgated the CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. In July 2019, EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions from the power sector. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). Accordingly, we expect the EPA to promulgate a new rule to regulate GHG emissions from power plants.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions -  NRG emits CO 2 (and small quantities of other GHGs) when generating electricity at a majority of its facilities. The graphs presented below illustrate NRG's domestic emissions of CO2e for the 2014, and the 2018 through  2020  period.  Nearly  all  (>99%)  of  NRG's  GHG  emissions  are  subject  to  federal  (U.S.  EPA)  GHG  reporting requirements.\n\nIn 2019, NRG announced the acceleration of its science-based GHG emissions reduction goals to align with prevailing climate science, which seeks to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius. NRG is targeting a 50% reduction by 2025, from its current 2014 baseline, and net-zero emissions by 2050. From 2014 to 2020, the Company's CO2e emissions  decreased  from  63  million  metric  tons  to  28  million  metric  tons,  representing  a  cumulative  55%  reduction.  The decrease is attributed to reductions in fleet-wide annual net generation, a market-driven shift away from coal as a primary fuel to natural gas, and in 2020 reduced load as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company believes the 2020 emissions level may change as load recovers from the impact of COVID-19. The Company is continuing to target a 50% reduction by 2025 and is on track to meet that goal.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, less than 10% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets.\n\nThe  following  tables  reflect  the  Company's  generation  portfolio,  including  leased  facilities  and  those  accounted  for through equity method investments. Prior year information was adjusted to remove divested assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination\n\nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. In September 2017, the EPA agreed to reconsider the rule. On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the existing ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy ponds. In 2019 and 2020, the EPA proposed several changes to this rule. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B: Alternative Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments,\" which further amended the April 2015 Rule to, among other things, provide procedures for requesting approval to operate existing ash impoundments with an alternate liner. The Company has updated its estimates of required environmental capital expenditures to address this revised rule.",

        "page_content": "## Domestic Site Remediation Matters\n\nUnder certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances  or  petroleum  products.  NRG  may  be  responsible  for  property  damage,  personal  injury  and  investigation  and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations. Further discussions of affected NRG sites can be found in Item 15 -  Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nJewett Mine Lignite Contract -The Company's Limestone facility historically burned lignite obtained from the Jewett mine, which was operated by TWCC. In 2019, the Jewett mine and related lignite supply agreement with NRG were acquired by  Westmoreland Jewett Mining LLC (\"Jewett Mining\"), a subsidiary of Westmoreland Mining LLC pursuant to a plan of reorganization  confirmed  by  the  Texas  Bankruptcy  Court.  Effective  August  5,  2020,  NRG's  subsidiary,  NRG  Texas  LLC, acquired all of the equity interests of Jewett Mining. Active mining under the lignite supply agreement ceased as of December 31,  2016;  however,  under  the  terms  of  the  lignite  supply  agreement,  Jewett  Mining  remains  responsible  for  reclamation activities  and  NRG  is  responsible  for  all  reclamation  costs.  NRG  has  recorded  an  adequate  ARO  liability.  The  Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of approximately $99 million for the reclamation of the Jewett mine, which NRG supports through surety bonds. The cost of the reclamation may exceed the value of the bonds. NRG may provide additional performance assurance if required by the Railroad Commission of Texas.\n\nNuclear Waste - The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was  discontinued  in  2010.  Since  1998,  the  U.S.  DOE  has  been  in  default  of  the  federal  government's  obligations  to  begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, or SNF, and high-level radioactive waste, or HLW, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of  nuclear  plants,  including  the  owners  of  STP,  had  been  required  to  enter  into  contracts  setting  out  the  obligations  of  the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which has been extended three times through addendums to cover payments through December 31, 2022. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the U.S., nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW.\n\nUnder the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended in 1985, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state. Texas is currently in a compact with the state of Vermont, and the compact low-level waste facility located in Andrews County in Texas has been operational since 2012.\n\n## Water\n\nThe  Company  is  required  under  the  CWA  to  comply  with  intake  and  discharge  requirements,  requirements  for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements.\n\nEffluent Limitations Guidelines -  I n  November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for  bottom  ash  transport  water;  and  (iii)  changing  several  deadlines.  The  Company  is  in  the  process  of  estimating  the environmental capital expenditures that will be required to comply. The capital expenditures required to comply will depend on elections regarding future operations of each coal-fired unit. NRG expects to make these elections for each unit in Q4 2021 at which time the EPA will be notified as required. Accordingly, we do not expect to provide estimates of ELG compliance costs until early 2022.\n\n## Regional Environmental Developments\n\nNY NOx -  On  December 31, 2019, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation finalized a more stringent NOx regulation that will result in the retirement of the Company's combustion turbines in Astoria, New York in 2023.",

On March 30, 2020, the state released its proposed implementing regulations. The Company expects the state to promulgate the final implementing regulations in March 2021, at which time regulated entities will then prepare and submit permit applications.\n\n## Customers\n\nNRG sells  to  a  wide  variety  of  customers,  primarily  end-use  customers  in  the  residential,  commercial  and  industrial sectors. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers, such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company had no customer that comprised more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries had 4,104 employees, approximately 23% of whom were covered by U.S. collective bargaining agreements. During 2020, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.\n\nNRG believes  its  employees  are  vital  to  its  success  and  is  committed  to  offering  employees  a  rewarding  career  that provides opportunities for growth and the ability to make valuable contributions toward the achievement of the Company's business objectives.

In 2020, NRG completed a gender and race pay equity study to ensure that the Company's pay decisions were not influenced by gender, race, or other similar factors. The  study  showed  equitable  pay  practices  after  accounting  for  education,  experience,  performance  and  location.  NRG  also conducted company-wide unconscious bias training to help all employees recognize, understand, and reduce implicit bias and offers various other related guides and tools to its employees and management.\n\n## Talent Development\n\nNRG deploys various talent development strategies and programs with the goal of ensuring a pipeline of leadership who can execute on the Company's strategy and drive value for all stakeholders. The Board of Directors regularly engages with management  on  leadership  development  and  succession  planning,  including  providing  feedback  on  development  plans  and bench strength for key senior leader positions. The Board of Directors also has a structured program that allows directors to interact  directly  with  individuals  deeper  within  the  organization  whom  management,  through  a  robust  talent  assessment program, as well as mentoring relationships, has identified as high potential future leaders. The Company has a performance management tool that emphasizes a continuous feedback loop and a robust online training curriculum with topics including leadership, communication and productivity.\n\n## Total Rewards\n\nNRG seeks to provide the median target of compensation and benefits, benchmarked against direct peers, industry, and, where  appropriate,  general  peers.  To  ensure  incentives  are  properly  aligned  with  business  needs  and  can  attract  and  retain qualified  employees,  the  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  actively  reviews  the  Company's  total  rewards programs, including benchmarking programs against peer groups, assessing the risks of programs and evaluating the design of the annual and long-term incentive programs.

A  widespread healthcare  crisis,  such  as  an  outbreak  of  a  communicable  disease,  could  adversely  affect  the  global  economy  and  the Company's  ability  to  conduct  its  business  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time.  For  example,  the  ongoing  global  COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted local and global economies, disrupted financial markets and international trade, resulted in increased  unemployment  levels  and  impacted  local  and  global  supply  chains,  all  of  which  negatively  impact  the  electricity industry and the Company's business. In addition, federal, state, and local governments have implemented various mitigation measures, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activities. Although the operations of the Company are considered an essential service, some of these measures have  adversely  impacted  the  ability  of  NRG  employees,  contractors,  suppliers,  customers,  and  other  business  partners  to conduct  business  activities.  This  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations,  financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity.\n\nIn particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could:\n\n- \u00b7 adversely impact demand for the Company's electricity services and other products and services and the ability of customers to pay their bills;\n- \u00b7 cause an increase in costs for  the  Company as a result  of  emergency  measures  taken  by  state  and  local  regulatory authorities in response to the COVID-19 crisis, including regulatory changes prohibiting customer disconnects and late fees;\n- \u00b7 impact  the  ability  of  the  Company's  partners  or  counterparties  to  perform  their  obligations  under  existing arrangements, including development projects, power purchase and sale arrangements, hedging arrangements or other commercial activities; and\n- \u00b7 cause other unpredicted events which may have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity.\n\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity increases the longer the virus, or any variants thereof, impacts the level of economic activity in the United States and abroad. NRG cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future  impact  of  COVID-19,  or  any  resurgence  of  COVID-19  or  other  pandemic  may  have  on  the  Company's  results  of operations, financial position, risk exposure and liquidity.\n\n## Risks Related to the Acquisition of Direct Energy\n\n## The acquisition of Direct Energy may not achieve its intended results.\n\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of cost savings and operating efficiencies of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of NRG and Direct Energy are integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, lower-than-expected revenues or income generated by  the  combined  company  and  diversion  of  management's  time  and  energy,  which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the Company's business, financial results and prospects.\n\n## The  Company will  be  subject  to  business  uncertainties  related  to  Direct  Energy  that  could  adversely  affect  its  financial results.\n\nUncertainty about the effects of the acquisition of Direct Energy on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on NRG's business. Although the Company intends to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair its ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel for a period of time, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with it to seek to change existing business relationships.\n\nEmployee  retention  and  recruitment  may  be  particularly  challenging,  as  employees  and  prospective  employees  may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company. If, despite the Company's retention and recruiting efforts, key employees  depart  or  fail  to  accept  employment  with  NRG  because  of  issues  relating  to  the  uncertainty  and  difficulty  of integration or a desire not to remain with NRG, the Company's financial results could be affected.",

NRG  could  have  difficulty  integrating  the  acquired  assets  and  personnel  of  Direct Energy with its own. The integration of NRG and Direct Energy may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks that could impact the Company negatively include:\n\n- \u00b7 the difficulty of managing and integrating Direct Energy and its operations;\n- \u00b7 the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of management;\n- \u00b7 changes in our business focus and/or management;\n- \u00b7 difficulties  in  implementing  and  maintaining  uniform  processes,  systems,  standards,  controls,  procedures,  practices, policies and compensation standards;\n- \u00b7 unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications, and other systems;\n- \u00b7 the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n- \u00b7 the  potential  impairment  of  relationships  with  employees  and  partners  as  a  result  of  any  integration  of  new management personnel;\n- \u00b7 unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition of Direct Energy, including delays to the integration of Direct Energy's business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- \u00b7 the potential difficulty in managing an increased number of locations and employees;\n- \u00b7 the potential loss of valuable employees;\n- \u00b7 difficulty addressing any possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n- \u00b7 unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations; and\n- \u00b7 the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired.\n\nIf  the  Company is not successful in addressing these risks effectively, the business could be impacted. Many of these factors will be outside of the Company's control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially affect NRG's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## Risks Related to the Operation of NRG's Business\n\n## NRG's financial  performance  may  be  impacted  by  price  fluctuations  in  the  retail  and  wholesale  power  and  natural  gas markets, as well as fluctuations in coal and oil markets and other market factors that are beyond the Company's control.\n\nMarket prices for power, capacity, ancillary services, natural gas, coal and oil are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances,  especially  in  the  day-ahead  and  spot  markets.  Long  and  short-term  power  and  gas  prices  may  also  fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of the Company's control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in generation capacity in the Company's markets, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new plants, expansion of existing plants, the continued operation of uneconomic power plants due to state subsidies, or additional transmission capacity;\n- \u00b7 environmental regulations and legislation;\n- \u00b7 electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions;\n- \u00b7 changes in power and gas transmission infrastructure;\n- \u00b7 fuel price volatility and transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n- \u00b7 changes in law, including judicial decisions;\n- \u00b7 weather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of climate change;\n- \u00b7 changes in commodity prices and the supply of commodities, including but not limited to natural gas, coal and oil;\n- \u00b7 changes in the demand for power or gas, or in patterns of power or gas usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools and practices, distributed generation, and more efficient end-use technologies;\n- \u00b7 development of new fuels, new technologies and new forms of competition for the production of power;\n- \u00b7 economic and political conditions;\n- \u00b7 federal, state and provincial power regulations and legislation, and regulations and actions of the ISO and RTOs;\n- \u00b7 changes in prices related to RECs; and\n- \u00b7 changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.\n\nWhile  retail  rates  are  generally  designed  to  allow  retail  sellers  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  to  pass  through  price fluctuations  and  other  changes  to  costs,  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  pass  through  all  such  changes  to  customers.  For example, serving retail power customers in ISOs that have a capacity market exposes the Company to the risk that capacity costs  can  change  and  may  not  be  recoverable,  or  the  Company  may  engage  in  sales  of  power  at  fixed  prices.  Additionally, increases in wholesale costs to retail customers may cause additional customer defaults or increased customer attrition, or may be limited by regulatory rules.\n\nFurther, low natural gas prices can cause natural gas to be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. Because the Company enters into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate its base load coal-fired generating facilities, the Company may experience periods where it holds excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in the Company reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities. In addition, the Company may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of its generating requirements.\n\nSuch factors and the associated fluctuations in power prices have affected the Company's wholesale and retail profitability in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\n\n## Volatile  power  and  gas  supply  costs  and  demand  for  power  and  gas  could  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of NRG's retail operations.\n\nNRG's retail power operations purchase a significant portion of their supply from third parties. All of the gas sold by the Company in retail and wholesale markets is purchased from third parties. As a result, financial performance depends on the ability  to  obtain  adequate  supplies  of  power  and  gas  from  third  parties  at  prices  below  the  prices  it  charges  its  customers. Consequently, the Company's earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which the wholesale power or gas prices rise at a greater rate than the rates the Company can charge to customers. The price of wholesale electricity and gas supply purchases associated with the retail operations' energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to, among other factors:\n\n- \u00b7 varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of entering into related contracts;\n- \u00b7 subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas;",

In addition, many of NRG's generation facilities are exposed to market risk because they operate as \"merchant\" facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output. Without the benefit of long-term power sales or purchase agreements, and without long-term load obligations, NRG cannot be sure that it will be able to sell or purchase power at commercially attractive rates or that its generation facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of the Company's property, plants and equipment, the closing of certain of its facilities or the loss of retail customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Competition  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and  the  market  value  of  its assets.\n\nNRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its  business,  and  additional  competitors  may  enter  the  industry.  The Company's  retail  operations  specifically  face  competition  for  customers.  Competitors  may  offer  different  products,  lower prices,  and  other  incentives,  which  may  attract  customers  away  from  the  Company.  In  some  retail  electricity  markets,  the principal competitor may be the incumbent utility. The incumbent utility has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers and strong brand recognition. Furthermore, NRG may face competition from other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services, who may develop businesses that will compete with NRG.\n\nThe Company's plant operations face competition from newer or more efficient plants owned by competitors, which may put some of the Company's plants at a disadvantage to the extent these competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the Company's plant. Over time, the Company's plants may be unable to compete with these more efficient plants, which could result in retirements.\n\nNRG's competitors may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more  effective  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  greater  ability  to  incur  losses,  longer-standing  relationships  with customers,  greater  potential  for  profitability  from  retail  sales  or  greater  flexibility  in  the  timing  of  their  sale  of  generation capacity and ancillary services than NRG does. Competitors may also have better access to subsidies or other out-of-market payments that put NRG at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nNRG's competitors  may  be  able  to  respond  more  quickly  to  new  laws  or  regulations  or  emerging  technologies,  or  to devote greater resources to marketing of retail power than NRG can. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share.\n\nThere can be no assurance that NRG will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## NRG's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel supplies.\n\nNRG relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel a majority of its power generation facilities. Grid operations depend on the continuing financial viability  of  contractual  counterparties,  as  well  as  the  infrastructure  (including  rail  lines,  rail  cars,  barge facilities,  roadways,  riverways  and  natural  gas  pipelines)  available  to  serve  generation  facilities  and  to  ensure  that  there  is sufficient power produced to meet retail demand. As a result, the Company's wholesale generation facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its generation facilities if no fuel is available at any price, if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.\n\nNRG routinely hedges both its wholesale sales and purchases to support its retail load obligations. In order to hedge these obligations, the Company may enter into long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel. Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel supplier or transporter.",

        "page_content": "Disruptions  in  the  Company's  fuel  supplies  or  power  supply  arrangements  may  therefore  require  it  to  find  alternative  fuel sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to deliver to retail customers or other counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to counterparties for failure to deliver power or sell electricity or natural gas as contracted. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG also buys significant quantities of electricity and fuel on a short-term or spot market basis. Prices sometimes rise or fall significantly over a relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. Retail rates may also not rise at the same rate or may not rise at all. This may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG's plant operating characteristics and equipment, particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be available at any price or the Company may not be able to transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with different quality coal can lead to emission or operating problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of specific plants and on the Company's results of operations.\n\n## There may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale or purchase obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.\n\nThe  Company  may  sell  fixed  price  gas  as  a  proxy  for  power.  Because  the  obligations  under  most  of  the  Company's forward sale agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company does not have sufficient lower-cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company would be required to supply replacement power either by running its other, higher cost power plants  or  by  obtaining  power  from  third-party  sources  at  market  prices  that  could  substantially  exceed  the  contract  price.  If NRG fails to deliver the contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.\n\n## NRG's trading operations and use of hedging agreements could result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of operations,  and  NRG's  hedging  activities  may  increase  the  volatility  in  the  Company's  quarterly  and  annual  financial results.\n\nThe Company typically enters  into  hedging  agreements,  including  contracts  to  purchase  or  sell  commodities  at  future dates  and  at  fixed  prices,  to  manage  the  commodity  price  risks  inherent  in  its  business.  The  Company's  risk  management policies and hedging procedures may not mitigate risk as planned, and the Company may fail to fully or effectively hedge its commodity  supply  and  price  risk.  In  addition,  these  activities,  although  intended  to  mitigate  price  volatility,  expose  the Company to other risks. When the Company sells or buys power or gas forward, it gives up the opportunity to buy or sell at the future price, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The Company also relies on counterparty performance under its hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the Company's business, operating results or financial position.\n\nNRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the Company's results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity prices.\n\nNRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly related to the operation of the Company's generation facilities or the management of related risks. These trading activities take place in volatile markets and some of these trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would expect to settle these trades financially rather than through the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.\n\nNRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts. These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for",

As a result, the Company's quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices.\n\n## NRG may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks effectively.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  market  risks  through  its  retail  and  wholesale  operations,  which  involve  the  purchase  of electricity  and  natural  gas  for  resale,  the  sale  of  energy,  capacity  and  related  products,  and  the  purchase  and  sale  of  fuel, transmission services and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from location and timing differences that may be associated with buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and delivering energy to a buyer.\n\nNRG  undertakes  these  market  activities  through  agreements  with  various  counterparties.  Many  of  the  Company's agreements  with  counterparties  include  provisions  that  require  the  Company  to  provide  guarantees,  offset  or  netting arrangements, letters of credit, a first lien on assets and/or cash collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the Company's default or insolvency. The amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price  of  the  commodity  in  a  given  contract  and  the  market  price  of  the  commodity.  Significant  movements  in market prices can result in the Company being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company's strategy may depend on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to the Company's counterparties may negatively affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\nFurther,  if  any  of  NRG's  facilities  experience  unplanned  outages  or  if  retail  customers  use  more  power  or  gas  than expected,  the  Company  may  be  required  to  procure  additional  power  or  gas  at  spot  market  prices  to  fulfill  contractual commitments.  Without  adequate  liquidity  to  meet  margin  and  collateral  requirements,  the  Company  may  be  exposed  to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.\n\n## Operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on NRG's revenues and results of operations, and NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.\n\nThe ongoing operation of NRG's facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and the inability to transport the Company's product to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled  outages  due  to  mechanical  failures  or  other  problems  occur  from  time  to  time  and  are  an  inherent  risk  of  the Company's business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Company's operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce the Company's revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or non-performance penalties or require NRG to incur significant costs as a result of running one of its higher cost units or obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy the Company's forward power sales obligations. NRG's inability to operate the Company's plants efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate earnings and cash flow from the Company's asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn  addition,  NRG  provides  plant  operations  and  commercial  services  to  a  variety  of  third-parties.  There  is  a  risk  that mistakes, mis-operations, or actions taken by these third-parties could be attributed to NRG, including the risk of investigation or penalties being assessed to NRG in connection with the services it offers, or that regulators could question whether NRG had the appropriate safeguards in place.\n\nPower  generation  involves  hazardous  activities,  including  acquiring,  transporting  and  unloading  fuel,  operating  large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company's operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties.\n\nNRG  maintains  an  amount  of  insurance  protection  that  it  considers  adequate,  obtains  warranties  from  vendors  and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, but the Company cannot provide any assurance that these measures will  be  sufficient  or  effective  under  all  circumstances  and  against  all  hazards  or  liabilities  to  which  it  may  be  subject. A successful claim for which the Company is not fully insured or protected could hurt its financial results and materially harm NRG's financial condition.

Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced profitability.\n\nNRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof) needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## NRG and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance.\n\nNRG  and  its  subsidiaries  have  issued  certain  guarantees  of  the  performance  of  others,  which  obligate  NRG  and  its subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by the third parties, NRG could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Company.\n\n## Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.\n\nNRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel, chemicals and other services required for the operation of certain of its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as, when and where required or at comparable prices.\n\nAt times, NRG may rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. In many cases for renewable generation, these purchases are specific to a facility, which at times may be in the early  stages  of  development.  The  Company  may  also  hedge  a  portion  of  its  exposure  to  power  and  fuel  price  fluctuations through various physical or financial agreements with counterparties. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations, and in case of renewable generation, such counterparties may be subject to additional risks, such  as  facility  development  and  transmission  risks,  unfavorable  weather  and  atmospheric  conditions,  and  mechanical  or operational  failures.  NRG  may  not  be  able  to  enter  into  replacement  agreements  on  terms  as  favorable  as  its  existing agreements, or at all. If the Company was unable to enter into replacement PPAs, the Company would sell its plants' power at market  prices.  If  the  Company  is  unable  to  enter  into  replacement  fuel  or  fuel  transportation  purchase  agreements  or  other replacement  hedging  agreements,  the  Company  would  be  exposed  to  market  price  volatility  and  the  risk  that  fuel  and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price.\n\nThe failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.\n\n## NRG  relies  on  power  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  that  it  does  not  own  or  control  and  that  are  subject  to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's core regions.\n\nNRG depends on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by others to deliver power to its customers. If  transmission  or  distribution  is  disrupted,  including  by  force  majeure  events,  or  if  the  transmission  or  distribution infrastructure  is  inadequate,  NRG's  ability  to  deliver  power  may  be  adversely  impacted.  The  Company  also  cannot  predict whether transmission or distribution facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.\n\nIn  addition,  in  certain  of  the  markets  in  which  NRG  operates,  energy  transmission  congestion  may  occur  and  the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs associated with power sales or purchases, or retail sales, particularly where the Company's load is not co-located with its retail sales obligations. If NRG were liable for such congestion costs, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected.",

        "page_content": "## NRG relies on storage, transportation assets and suppliers, which they do not own or control, to deliver natural gas.\n\nThe Company depends on natural gas pipelines and other transportation and storage facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale and retail markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. The Company's ability  to  provide  natural  gas  for  its  present  and  projected  sales  will  depend  upon  its  suppliers'  ability  to  obtain  and  deliver supplies of natural gas, as well as NRG's ability to acquire supplies directly from new sources. Factors beyond the control of the Company and its suppliers may affect the Company's ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties' control over  the  drilling  of  new  wells  and  the  facilities  to  transport  natural  gas  to  the  Company's  receipt  points,  development  of additional interstate pipeline infrastructure, availability of supply sources competition for the acquisition of natural gas, priority allocations, impact of severe weather disruptions to natural gas supplies and the regulatory and pricing policies of federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the U.S. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of the Company to sell and deliver its products and services may be hindered. As a result, the Company may be responsible for damages incurred by its customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. These conditions could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Rates and terms for service of certain residential and commercial customers in Alberta are subject to regulatory review and approval.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of Direct Energy, the Company owns Direct Energy Regulated Services, which serves as a regulated rate supplier for residential and commercial energy customers in portions of the province of Alberta. It is required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for sales of power and natural  gas.  These  proceedings  typically  involve  multiple  parties,  including  governmental  bodies  and  officials,  consumer advocacy  groups  and  various  consumers  of  energy,  who  have  differing  concerns  but  who  have  the  common  objective  of limiting  rate  increases  or  even  reducing  rates.  Decisions  are  subject  to  appeal,  potentially  leading  to  additional  uncertainty associated  with  the  approval  proceedings.  The  potential  duration  of  such  proceedings  creates  a  risk  that  rates  ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for the Company to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective.  Established  rates  are  also  subject  to  subsequent  reviews  by  regulators,  whereby  various  portions  of  rates could be adjusted,  subject  to  refund  or  disallowed.  In  certain  instances,  the  Company  could  agree  to  negotiated  settlements related  to  various  rate  matters  and  other  cost  recovery  elements.  These  settlements  are  subject  to  regulatory  approval.  The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the Company to recover its costs or earn an adequate return. In addition, subsequent legislative or regulatory action could alter the terms on which the regulated business operates and future earnings could be negatively impacted. The Company also operates a competitive energy supply business in Alberta that is not subject to rate regulation and is subject to stringent requirements to segregate operations and information relating to the competitive business from the regulated business. Failure to comply with these and other requirements on the business could subject the Company's regulated and competitive businesses in Alberta to fines, penalties, and restrictions on the ability to continue business.\n\n## Because NRG owns less than a majority of the ownership interests of some of its project investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over their operations.\n\nNRG  has  limited  control  over  the  operation  of  some  project  investments  and  joint  ventures  because  the  Company's investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a degree  of  influence  with  respect  to  the  management  and  operation  of  projects  in  which  it  owns  less  than  a  majority  of  the ownership  interests  by  negotiating  to  obtain  positions  on  management  committees  or  to  receive  certain  limited  governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may  be  dependent  on  its  co-venturers  to  operate  such  projects.  The  Company's  co-venturers  may  not  have  the  level  of experience, technical expertise, human resources management or other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the Company's interest in projects.\n\n## NRG may be unable to integrate the operations of acquired entities in the manner expected.\n\nNRG enters into acquisitions that result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions depends on whether the businesses can be integrated into NRG in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of  valuable  employees,  the  disruption  of  NRG's  businesses,  processes  and  systems  or  inconsistencies  in  standards,  controls, procedures,  practices,  policies  and  compensation  arrangements,  any  of  which  could  divert  the  attention  of  management  and adversely  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the  acquisitions.  NRG  may  have  difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits",

The acquisition of companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence, the risk of overpaying for assets or customers, the ability to retain customers and the inability to arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company's acquisitions may not be successfully integrated. In the case of dispositions, such risks may relate to employment matters, counterparties, regulators and other stakeholders in the disposed business, risks relating to separating  the  disposed  assets  from  NRG's  business,  risks  related  to  the  management  of  NRG's  ongoing  business,  risks unknown to NRG at the time, and other financial, legal and operational risks related to such disposition. In addition, NRG may be subject to material trailing liabilities from disposed businesses. Any such risk may result in one or more costly disputes or litigation.  There  can  be  no  assurances  that  any  future  acquisitions  will  perform  as  expected  or  that  the  returns  from  such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them. There can also be no assurances that NRG will realize the anticipated benefits from any such dispositions. The failure to realize the anticipated returns or benefits from an acquisition or disposition could adversely affect NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## The  Company has made investments,  and  may  continue  to  make  investments,  in  new  business  initiatives  predominantly focused on consumer products and in markets that may not be successful, may not achieve the intended financial results or may result in product liability and reputational risk that could adversely affect the Company.\n\nNRG continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. Such initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current  operations,  inadequate  return  on  capital,  and  unidentified  issues  not  discovered  in  the  diligence  performed  prior  to launching an initiative or entering a market.\n\nAs  part  of  these  initiatives,  the  Company  may  be  liable  to  customers  for  any  damage  caused  to  customers'  homes, facilities,  belongings  or  property  during  the  installation  of  Company  products  and  systems,  such  as  mass  market  back-up generators and residential HVAC system repairs, installation and replacements. Where such work is performed by independent contractors, such as repairs performed under the Company's home warranty and protection plan products, the Company may nonetheless face claims and costs for damage. In addition, shortages of skilled labor for Company projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase its costs. The products that the Company sells or manufactures may expose the Company to  product liability  claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although the Company maintains liability insurance, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to the Company on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, any product liability claim or damage caused by the Company could significantly impair the Company's brand  and  reputation,  which  may  result  in  a  failure  to  maintain  customers  and  achieve  the  Company's  desired growth initiatives in these new businesses.\n\n## NRG's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees or inability to replace employees as they retire.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 23% of NRG's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company's union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the Company could experience reduced power  generation  or  outages.  Although  NRG's  ability  to  procure  such  labor  is  uncertain,  contingency  staffing  planning  is completed as part of each respective contract negotiations. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a number of the Company's employees at NRG's plants are close to retirement. The Company's inability to replace retiring workers could create potential knowledge and expertise gaps as such workers retire.\n\n## Changes in technology may impair the value of NRG's power plants and the attractiveness of its retail products, and the Company may potentially be affected by emerging technologies that may over time affect change in capacity markets and the energy industry overall with the inclusion of distributed generation and clean technology.\n\nResearch and development activities are ongoing in the industry to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to produce  power,  including  wind,  photovoltaic  (solar)  cells,  hydrogen,  energy  storage,  and  improvements  in  traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the costs",

Technology, including distributed technology or changes in retail rate structures, may also have a material impact on the Company's ability to retain retail customers.\n\nSome emerging technologies,  such  as  distributed  renewable  energy  technologies,  broad  consumer  adoption  of  electric vehicles and energy storage devices, could affect the price of energy. These emerging technologies may affect the financial viability of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on wholesale market prices, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Risks that are beyond NRG's control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, hostile cyber intrusions, data breaches or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nNRG's generation facilities and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well  as  events  occurring  in  response  to  or  in  connection  with  such  activities,  all  of  which  could  cause  environmental repercussions  and/or  result  in  full  or  partial  disruption  of  the  facilities  ability  to  generate,  transmit,  transport  or  distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than  other  domestic  targets.  Any  such  environmental  repercussions  or  disruption  could  result  in  a  significant  decrease  in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant  weather  events  or  terrorist  actions  could  damage  or  shut  down  the  power  or  gas  transmission  and  distribution facilities upon which the Company is dependent, which may reduce retail volume for extended periods of time. Power or gas supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant loss of retail customer demand.\n\nNumerous  functions  affecting  the  efficient  operation  of  NRG's  businesses  depend  on  the  secure  and  reliable  storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems, as well as electronic control systems used at the generation facilities and for the distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as  well  as  significant  expense  to  repair  security  breaches  or  system  damage.  The  operation  of  NRG's  generation  plants, including STP, and of NRG's energy and fuel trading businesses rely on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, are subject to the  risk  that  such  systems  could  be  the  target  of  disruptive  actions,  particularly  through  cyber-attack  or  cyber  intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information could be lost or stolen, causing NRG to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to NRG's reputation. In addition, NRG may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its cyber systems and plants.\n\nIn addition, the Company requires access to sensitive data in the ordinary course of business. Examples of sensitive data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data, credit and debit card account numbers, driver's license numbers, social security numbers and bank account information. NRG provides  sensitive  data  to  vendors  and  service  providers,  who  require  access  to  this  information  in  order  to  provide services  to  NRG,  such  as  call  center  operations.  If  a  significant  breach  occurs  or  if  sensitive  data  that  was  entrusted  to  the Company were mishandled, the reputation of NRG and its businesses may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished,  or  NRG  and  its  retail  operations  may  be  subject  to  legal  claims,  any  of  which  may  contribute  to  the  loss  of customers and have a negative impact on the business and/or results of operations.\n\n## Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Laws\n\n## NRG's  business  is  subject  to  substantial  energy  regulation  and  may  be  adversely  affected  by  legislative  or  regulatory changes,  as  well  as  liability  under,  or  any  future  inability  to  comply  with,  existing  or  future  energy  regulations  or requirements.\n\nNRG's business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign and provincial laws. Compliance with, or changes to, the requirements under these legal and regulatory regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, reduce the Company's ability to hedge exposure or to sell retail power within certain states or to certain classes of retail customers, or restrict the Company's marketing practices, its ability to pass through costs to retail customers, or its ability to compete on favorable terms with competitors, including the incumbent utility. Retail competition and home warranty services are regulated on a state-by-state or at the province-by-province level and are highly dependent on state and provincial laws, regulations and policies, which could change at any moment. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of a non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.\n\nPublic  utilities  under  the  FPA  are  required  to  obtain  FERC  acceptance  of  their  rate  schedules  for  wholesale  sales  of electricity.

        "page_content": "companies and power marketing affiliates in the U.S. make sales of electricity in interstate commerce and are public utilities for purposes  of  the  FPA.  FERC  has  granted  each  of  NRG's  generating  and  power  marketing  companies  that  make  sales  of electricity outside of ERCOT the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC's orders that grant NRG's generating and  power  marketing  companies  market-based  rate  authority  reserve  the  right  to  revoke  or  revise  that  authority  if  FERC subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG's market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of NRG's generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated those rules, they are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority. If NRG's generating and power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain FERC's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates NRG charges for power from its facilities.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  the  Company's  generation  assets  are  also  subject  to  the  reliability  standards  promulgated  by  the designated  Electric  Reliability  Organization  (currently  NERC)  and  approved  by  FERC.  If  NRG  fails  to  comply  with  the mandatory  reliability  standards,  NRG  could  be  subject  to  sanctions,  including  substantial  monetary  penalties  and  increased compliance obligations. NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power  markets  impose,  and  in  the  future  may  continue  to  impose,  mitigation,  including  price  limitations,  offer  caps,  nonperformance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these  markets.  These  types  of  price  limitations  and  other  regulatory  mechanisms  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the profitability of NRG's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.\n\nThe regulatory environment has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting wholesale and retail competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases, transmission. These changes are ongoing, and the Company cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on NRG's business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, as well as proposals to reinstate the vertical monopoly utility of the markets or require divestiture by generating companies to reduce their market share. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, the Company's business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, since 2010, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the United States and internationally.  These  regulations,  and  any  further  changes  thereto,  or  adoption  of  additional  regulations,  including  any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG's ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting NRG's ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.\n\n## NRG's business may be affected by interference in the competitive wholesale marketplace.\n\nNRG's  generation  and  competitive  retail  operations  rely  on  a  competitive  wholesale  marketplace.  The  competitive wholesale marketplace may be impacted by out-of-market subsidies, including bailouts of uneconomic nuclear plants, imports of power from Canada, renewable mandates or subsidies, mandates to sell power below its cost of acquisition and associated costs,  as  well  as  out-of-market  payments  to  new  or  existing  generators.  These  out-of-market  subsidies  to  existing  or  new generation  undermine  the  competitive  wholesale  marketplace,  which  can  lead  to  premature  retirement  of  existing  facilities, including those owned by the Company. If these measures continue, capacity and energy prices may be suppressed, and the Company may not be successful in its efforts to insulate the competitive market from this interference. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in competitive retail markets or own and operate facilities that could be provided by competitive market participants.\n\nThe integration  of  the  Capacity  Performance  product  into  the  PJM  market  and  the  Pay-for-Performance  mechanism  in ISO-NE could lead to substantial changes in capacity income and non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nBoth ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. NRG may experience substantial changes in capacity income and non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",

Such regulation includes licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation  and  modification  of  all  aspects  of  nuclear  reactor  power  plant  design  and  operation,  environmental  and  safety performance,  technical  and  financial  qualifications,  decommissioning  funding  assurance  and  transfer  and  foreign  ownership restrictions. The current facility operating licenses for STP expire on August 20, 2047 (Unit 1) and December 15, 2048 (Unit 2).\n\nThere are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power facility. These include liabilities related to the handling, treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and capital expenditures. Additionally, aging equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading  and  improvement.  Any  unexpected  failure,  including  failure  associated  with  breakdowns,  forced  outages,  or  any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. STP will be obligated to continue storing spent nuclear fuel if the U.S. DOE continues to fail to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose of STP's spent nuclear fuel. See also Item 1 -Regulatory Matters - Nuclear Operations - Decommissioning Trusts and Item 1 - Environmental Matters - Federal Environmental Initiatives - Nuclear Waste for further discussion. Costs associated with these risks could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition or cash flow to the extent not covered by the Decommissioning Trusts or recovered from ratepayers. In addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide power from more expensive alternative sources - either NRG's own plants, third party generators or the ERCOT - to cover the Company's then existing forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or modification could also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.\n\nWhile STP maintains property and liability insurance for losses related to nuclear operations, there may be limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available. See also Item 15 -Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies , Nuclear Insurance .  An  accident  at  STP  or  another  nuclear  facility  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  financial condition, its operational results, or liquidity as losses may exceed the insurance coverage available and/or may result in the obligation to pay retrospective premium obligations.\n\n## NRG is subject  to  environmental  laws  that  impose  extensive  and  increasingly  stringent  requirements  on  the  Company's ongoing  operations,  as  well  as  potentially  substantial  liabilities  arising  out  of  environmental  contamination.  These environmental requirements and liabilities could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nNRG is subject to the environmental laws of foreign and U.S., federal, state and local authorities. The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and obtain numerous governmental permits and approvals to build and operate the Company's plants. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time. Should NRG fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its operations, the Company could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions seeking to curtail the Company's operations. In  addition,  when  new  requirements  take  effect  or  when  existing  environmental  requirements  are  revised,  reinterpreted  or subject to changing enforcement policies, NRG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\n## NRG's businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change, and policies at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG emissions and mitigate climate change could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nFluctuations in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, may affect consumer demand for electricity or natural gas. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause it  to  incur  significant  costs  in  preparing  for  or  responding  to  these  effects.  These  or  other  changes  in  climate  could  lead  to increased operating costs or capital expenses. NRG's customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change  and  may  incur  significant  costs  in  preparing  for  or  responding  to  these  efforts,  including  increasing  the  mix  and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply.",

        "page_content": "Hazards customary to the power production industry include the potential for unusual weather conditions, which could affect fuel pricing and availability, the Company's route to market or access to customers, i.e., transmission and distribution lines, transportation and delivery, or critical plant assets. The contribution of climate change to the frequency or intensity of weather-related events could affect NRG's operations and planning process.\n\nClimate change could also affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for the continued operation of NRG's generation plants. NRG monitors water risk carefully. If it is determined that a water  supply  risk  exists  that  could  impact  projected  generation  levels  at  any  plant  risk  mitigation  efforts  are  identified  and evaluated for implementation.\n\nFurther,  demand  for  NRG's  energy-related  services  could  be  similarly  impacted  by  consumers'  preferences  or  market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage.\n\nNRG's GHG emissions for 2020 can be found in Item 1, Business -Environmental Regulatory Matters. GHG regulation, at  the  state  or  federal  level,  could  increase  the  cost  of  electricity  generated  by  fossil  fuels,  and  such  increases  could  reduce demand for the power NRG generates and markets. Any increase in costs at a national, regional or state level could adversely affect NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows\n\n## Changes in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations, particularly in California, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect NRG's business and financial results.\n\nThere has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfers, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere could impact how NRG processes personal information of employees, customers, and others. Effective January 1, 2020, the California  Consumer  Privacy  Act  of  2018  (the  'CCPA')  grants  certain  rights  to  California  residents  with  respect  to  their personal information, and the California electorate recently approved Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act (the 'CPRA'), which will replace the CCPA effective January 1, 2023 and grant additional rights to California residents as well as create a new state privacy regulator. As new laws are created, NRG cannot determine the impact that they may have on the Company's business. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with laws may result in proceedings or actions against the Company by governmental entities or individuals. Moreover, any inquiries or investigations, any other government actions, or any  actions  by  individuals  may  be  costly  to  comply  with,  result  in  negative  publicity,  increase  operating  costs,  require significant management time and attention, and lead to remedies that may harm the business, including fines, demands or orders that existing business practices be modified or terminated.\n\nThe  General  Data  Protection  Regulation,  adopted  in  the  European  Union,  requires  companies  to  satisfy  strict  new requirements regarding the handling of personal information, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is processed to exercise a number of rights with respect to their personal information, such as correcting or requiring deletion of data  about  themselves.  The  CCPA  requires  companies  to  make  new  disclosures  to  consumers  about  such  companies'  data collection, use, and sharing practices and inform consumers of their personal information rights such as deletion rights, allows consumers to opt out of data sales to third parties, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CPRA will add more  disclosure  obligations  (including  an  obligation  to  disclose  retention  periods  or  criteria  for  categories  of  personal information), grant consumers additional rights (including rights to correct their data, limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information, and opt out of the sharing of personal information for certain targeted behavioral advertising purposes), which will likely result in greater regulatory activity and enforcement in the privacy area.\n\n## NRG's retail operations are subject to changing rules and regulations that could have a material impact on the Company's profitability.\n\nThe competitiveness of NRG's retail operations partially depends on regulatory policies that establish the structure, rules, terms and conditions on which services are offered to retail customers. These policies can include, among other things, controls on the retail rates that NRG can charge, the imposition of additional costs on sales, restrictions on the Company's ability to obtain new customers through various marketing channels and disclosure requirements. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in competitive retail markets or own and  operate  facilities  that  could  be  provided  by  competitive  market  participants.  Additionally,  state,  federal  or  provincial imposition of net metering or RPS programs can make it more or less expensive for retail customers to supplement or replace their reliance on grid power.\n\n## The  Company's  international  operations  are  exposed  to  political  and  economic  risks,  commercial  instability  and  events beyond  the  Company's  control  in  the  countries  in  which  it  operates,  which  risks  may  negatively  impact  the  Company's business.\n\nThe  Company's  international  operations  depend  on  products  manufactured,  purchased  and  sold  in  the  U.S.  and internationally,  including  in  countries  with  political  and  economic  instability.  In  some  cases,  these  countries  have  greater",

        "page_content": "political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in NRG's other markets. Operating a business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the Company to a number of risks, including: multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; imposition of currency restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; national and international conflict, including terrorist  acts;  and  political  and  economic  instability  or  civil  unrest  that  may  severely  disrupt  economic  activity  in affected countries.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Related to the Company's Indebtedness and Economic and Financial Market Conditions\n\nNRG's level  of  indebtedness  could  adversely  affect  its  ability  to  raise  additional  capital  to  fund  its  operations  or  return capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry.\n\nNRG's substantial debt could have negative consequences, including:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing NRG's vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n- \u00b7 requiring a substantial portion of NRG's cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG's ability to pay dividends or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have less debt; and\n- \u00b7 exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest, primarily through its Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company's credit documents contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's ability to return  capital  to  stockholders  or  otherwise  engage  in  activities  that  may  be  in  its  long-term  best  interests.  NRG's  failure  to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all  of  the  Company's  indebtedness.  In  addition,  the  Company  recently  amended  its  corporate  credit  agreement  to  include  a sustainability-linked  metric  and  issued  sustainability-linked  bonds,  which  could  result  in  increased  interest  expense  to  the Company  if  the  sustainability  metrics  set  forth  therein  are  not  met.  Furthermore,  financial  and  other  restrictive  covenants contained in any project level subsidiary debt may limit the ability of NRG to receive distributions from such subsidiary.\n\nIn addition, NRG's ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including: general economic and capital market conditions;  credit  availability  from  banks  and  other  financial  institutions;  investor  confidence  in  NRG,  its  partners  and  the regional wholesale power markets; NRG's financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries; NRG's level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements; maintenance of acceptable credit ratings; cash flow; and provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\n\nNRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.\n\n## Adverse  economic  conditions  could  adversely  affect  NRG's  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash flows.\n\nAdverse  economic  conditions  and  declines  in  wholesale  energy  prices,  partially  resulting  from  adverse  economic conditions, may impact NRG's results of operations. The breadth and depth of negative economic conditions may have a wideranging impact on the U.S. business environment. In addition, adverse economic conditions also reduce the demand for energy commodities.  Reduced  demand  from  negative  economic  conditions  continues  to  impact  the  key  domestic  wholesale  energy markets NRG serves. The combination of lower demand for power and increased supply of natural gas has put downward price pressure on wholesale energy markets in general, further impacting NRG's energy marketing results. In general, economic and commodity market conditions will continue to impact NRG's unhedged future energy margins, liquidity, earnings growth and overall financial condition. In addition, adverse economic conditions, declines in wholesale energy prices, reduced demand for power and other factors may negatively impact the trading price of NRG's common stock and impact forecasted cash flows, which may require NRG to evaluate its goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Any such impairment could have a material impact on NRG's financial statements.",

NRG  brings  the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services in major competitive power and gas markets in the U.S. and Canada in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. As of  December 31, 2020, the  Company sold energy, services,  and  innovative,  sustainable  products  and  services  directly  to  retail  customers  under  the brand names NRG, Reliant, Green Mountain Energy, Stream, and XOOM Energy, as well as other brand names owned by NRG, supported by approximately 23,000 MW of generation.\n\nFor discussion of COVID-19 related considerations refer to Item 1 - Business.\n\n## Business Environment\n\nThe industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2020 and for the future medium term include:\n\nCommodities Markets - The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2020, the average natural gas prices at Henry Hub was 21% lower than in 2019.\n\nIf  long-term  gas  prices  increase,  the  Company  is  likely  to  encounter  higher  realized  energy  prices,  leading  to  higher energy revenues as lower priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts with higher gas and power prices. This impact is partially offset by the retail operations, as NRG's retail gross margins have historically decreased as natural gas prices increase.\n\nNRG's retail gross margins have historically improved as natural gas prices decline. This would be partially offset by lower realized energy prices, leading to lower energy revenues as higher priced hedge contracts mature and are replaced by contracts  with  lower  gas  and  power  prices.  To  further  mitigate  this  impact,  NRG  may  increase  its  percentage  of  coal  and nuclear  capacity  sold  forward  using  a  variety  of  hedging  instruments,  as  described  under  the  heading  \"Energy-Related Commodities\"  in  Item  15  Note  6, Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities, to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "Natural  gas  prices  are  a  primary  driver  of  coal  demand.  The  low-priced  commodity  environment  has  stressed  coal equities, leading coal suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection, launch debt exchanges, rationalize assets, and cut production. If  multiple  parties  withdraw  from  the  market,  liquidity  could  be  challenged  in  the  short  term.  Inventory  overhang  will  be utilized to offset production losses. Coal prices are typically affected by the price of natural gas.\n\nElectricity Prices - The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the  Company's  profitability.  An  increase  in  supply  cost  volatility  in  the  competitive  retail  markets  may  result  in  smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table  summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. ERCOT power prices decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the lower power prices in summer and lower gas prices in the first half of the year. Power prices in the East and West/Other decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 due to lower prices associated with lower demand due to COVID-19.\n\n|                                                                                                       | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                       | Year Ended December 31                | Year Ended December 31                | 2020 vs 2019                          |\n| Region                                                                                                | 2020                                  | 2019                                  | Change %                              |\n| Texas  (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| ERCOT -

Intercompany financial transactions hedging generation with the retail operations make up $12.18/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2020 and $5.40/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nThe average realized power prices were relatively stable year over year due to the Company's hedging program.\n\nIncreased Awareness of, and Action to Combat, Climate Change - Diverse groups of stakeholders, including investors, asset  managers,  financial  institutions,  non-government  organizations,  industry  coalitions,  individual  companies,  consumer groups and academic institutions, are increasingly engaged in efforts to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to well below  2  degrees  Celsius.  As  a  result,  policymakers  and  regulators  at  regional,  national,  sub-national  and  local  levels  of government,  both  in  the  United  States  and  other  parts  of  the  world,  are  increasingly  focused  on  actions  to  combat  climate change.\n\nIn the United States, the current Administration has stated that limiting climate change is one of its top priorities. In its early days, the Administration issued an Executive Order on \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.\" This included commitments  to  reset  the  United  States'  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  targets  under  the  Paris  Climate  Agreement, integrate environmental justice considerations into all aspects of its climate and environmental policy, consider climate change and conservation in federal permitting decisions and align government procurement strategy and standards with climate goals.",

        "page_content": "To  enable  climate  policy  development  and  implementation,  the  Administration  has  pledged  to  adopt  a  \"whole-ofgovernment\" approach and is establishing various new climate-oriented positions and working groups. For example, it created the  White  House  Office  of  Domestic  Climate  Policy,  led  by  the  first-ever  National  Climate  Advisor  and  Deputy  National Climate Advisor, which will create a central office in the White House that is charged with coordinating and implementing the President's domestic climate agenda. The newly established National Climate Task Force will assemble representatives from across 21 federal agencies and departments. The Federal Reserve is creating a committee to deepen its understanding of the risks that climate change poses to the financial system. The SEC has created the new role of Senior Policy Advisor for Climate and Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") to oversee and coordinate the agency's efforts related to climate risk and other  ESG  developments,  and  to  examine  how  these  issues  intersect  with  the  regulatory  framework  across  its  offices  and divisions. An interagency working group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Revitalization will identify and deliver federal  resources  to  revitalize  the  economics  of  coal,  oil,  gas  and  power  plant  dependent  communities.  Outside  the  United States,  a  foreign  climate  agenda  will  be  advanced  through  the  Special  Presidential  Envoy  for  Climate  in  concert  with departments including State and Treasury.\n\nNRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate risks and opportunities to stakeholders. The Company became an early supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") recommendations after they were issued in 2017, published a TCFD mapping disclosure in December 2020 and will issue a stand-alone TCFD report in 2021.\n\nLower Carbon Infrastructure Development - Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported  and  continue  to  support  the  development  of  renewable  generation,  demand-side  and  smart  grid,  and  other  lower carbon infrastructure technologies. In addition, the costs associated with the development of lower carbon infrastructure, such as  wind  and  solar  generating  facilities,  continue  to  decline.  These  factors  continue  to  drive  increases  in  the  development  of lower carbon infrastructure in the markets where the Company participates, which may impact the ability of the Company's generating  facilities  to  participate  in  those  markets.  According  to  ERCOT,  Inc.,  36%  of  2020  energy  consumption  in  the ERCOT market was generated from carbon emission-free resources, with wind power contributing 23%. In addition, subsidies and  incentives  have  contributed  to  the  increase  in  renewable  power  sources,  and  customer  awareness  and  preferences  are shifting toward sustainable solutions. Increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.\n\nDigitization and Customization -  The electric industry is experiencing major technology changes in the way power is distributed  and  used  by  end-use  customers.  The  electric  grid  is  shifting  from  a  centralized  analog  system,  where  power  is generated  from  limited  sources  and  flows  in  one  direction,  to  a  decentralized  multidirectional  system,  where  power  can  be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage.\n\nWeather - Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG does business influence the Company's financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels and may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG's operations are typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts  of  its  business  at  once.  A  significant  portion  of  the  Company's  business  is  located  within  Texas,  and  extreme  weather conditions occurring in Texas may have a material impact on the Company's financial position.\n\nFor  discussion  of  the  recent  weather  event  in  Texas,  see Other  Significant  Events  -  Extreme  Weather  Event  in  Texas During February 2021 below.",

        "page_content": "## Other Significant Events\n\nThe following additional significant events occurred during 2020 and through the filing date:\n\n## Extreme Weather Event in Texas During February 2021\n\nDuring February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration, resulting in a power emergency,  blackouts,  and  an  estimated  all-time  peak  demand  of  77  GWs  (without  load  shed).  Ahead  of  the  event,  NRG launched residential  customer  communications calling for  conservation  across  all  of  its  brands,  and  initiated  residential  and commercial and industrial demand response programs to curtail customer load. The Company maximized available generating capacity and brought in additional resources to supplement in-state staff with technical and operating experts from the rest of its U.S. fleet. NRG is committed to working with all necessary stakeholders on a comprehensive, objective, and exhaustive root cause analysis of the entirety of the energy system.\n\nThe estimated financial impact is still preliminary, due to customer meter and settlement data not being finalized, as well as potential customer and counterparty risk and expected ERCOT default allocations. Based on a preliminary analysis, Winter Storm Uri's financial impact is not expected to be adverse to NRG's financial results. The Company separately stress-tested assumptions and although at a lower probability, this stress-test analysis indicated a potential plus or minus $100 million to income  from  continuing  operations  in  2021.  NRG's  integrated  platform  continues  to  deliver  stable  results  through unprecedented events.\n\n## Direct Energy Acquisition\n\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company acquired Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc. Direct Energy is a  leading  retail  provider  of  electricity,  natural  gas,  and  home  and  business  energy  related  products  and  services  in  North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increases NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and complements its integrated model. It also broadens the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it does not currently operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.\n\nThe  Company  paid  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $3.625  billion  in  cash,  subject  to  a  purchase  price  adjustment  of $77 million. The Company funded the purchase price using a combination of $715 million of cash on hand, $166 million from a draw on its Revolving Credit Facility (of which $107 million was used to fund acquisition costs and financing fees that are not included in the aggregate purchase price above) as well as approximately $2.9 billion in secured and unsecured corporate debt issued in December 2020. The Company also increased its collective collateral facilities by $3.4 billion through a combination of  amending  its  Revolving  Credit  Facility,  amending  its  credit  default  swap  facility,  entering  into  a  revolving  accounts receivable financing facility, entering into an uncommitted repurchase facility and entering into multiple agreements to issue letters of credit. For further discussion on the increase of collateral facilities, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources,  Item  15  Note  13,  Receivables Securitization and Repurchase Facility, and Item 15 -  Note 14, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases.\n\n## Issuance of 2029 Senior Unsecured Notes and 2031 Senior Unsecured Notes\n\nOn December 2, 2020, NRG issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Unsecured Notes\") and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% senior notes due 2031 (the \"2031 Unsecured Notes, together with the 2029 Unsecured Notes, the \"Unsecured Notes\").\n\n## Issuance of 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes\n\nOn December 2, 2020, NRG issued $1.4 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes, consisting of $500 million 2.000% senior secured first lien notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Secured Notes\") and $900 million 2.450% senior secured first lien notes due 2027 (the \"2027 Secured Notes\"), at a discount. The 2027 Secured Notes were issued under NRG's Sustainability-Linked  Bond  Framework,  which  links  attractive  financing  terms  with  the  realization  of  certain  sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Receivables Securitization and Repurchase Facility\n\nOn September 22, 2020, NRG Receivables LLC, a bankruptcy remote, special purpose, indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a revolving accounts receivable financing facility (the \"Receivables Facility\") for an amount up to $750 million, subject  to  adjustments  on  a  seasonal  basis,  with  issuers  of  asset-backed  commercial  paper  and  commercial  banks  (the \"Lenders\".) As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $198 million in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.",

Under  the  Repurchase  Facility,  the  Company  can  borrow  up  to  $75  million,  collateralized  by  a subordinated  note  issued  by  NRG  Receivables  LLC  to  NRG  Retail  LLC  in  favor  of  the  originating  entities  representing  a portion of the balance of receivables sold to NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility.\n\nFor further discussion on the Receivables Facility and Repurchase Facility, see Note 9, Receivables Securitization and Repurchase Facility.\n\n## Midwest Generation Lease Purchase\n\nOn September 29, 2020, Midwest Generation acquired all of the ownership interests in the Powerton facility and Units 7 and 8 of the Joliet facility, which were being leased through 2034 and 2030, respectively, for approximately $260 million. The purchase was funded with cash-on-hand.

The sale of the 290 MW solar project closed on February 3, 2021. On October 21, 2019, the Company had repaid the Agua Caliente Borrower 1 notes associated with the project of $83 million.\n\n## Sale of 4.8 GW of Fossil Generation Assets\n\nOn February 28, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight  Capital  Partners,  to  sell  approximately  4,850  MWs  of  fossil  generating  assets  from  its  East  and  West  regions  of operations for total proceeds of $760 million, subject to standard purchase price adjustments and certain other indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG is entering into a tolling agreement for its 866 MW Arthur Kill plant in New York City through April 2025.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, and is subject to various closing conditions, approvals and consents, including FERC, NYSPSC, and antitrust review under Hart-Scott-Rodino.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn 2020, the Company completed $224 million of share repurchases at an average price of $33.05 per share, including $27 million of equivalent shares purchased in lieu of tax withholdings on equity compensation issuance.\n\n## Renewable Power Purchase Agreements\n\nNRG began execution of its strategy to procure mid to long-term generation through power purchase agreements in 2019.

The tenor of these agreements is an average between eleven and twelve years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business.

These amendments include improved terms for NRG.\n\n## Dividend Increase\n\nIn the first  quarter  of  2020,  NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.20 from $0.12 per share, as part of a long-term capital  allocation  policy  adopted  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019  that  targets  allocating  50%  of  cash  available  for  allocation generated each year to growth investments and 50% to be returned to shareholders. The return of capital to shareholders is expected to be completed through the increased dividend supplemented by share repurchases. The long-term capital allocation policy targets an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in years subsequent to 2020. In 2021, NRG further increased the annual dividend to $1.30 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Economic Gross Margin\n\nIn  addition  to  gross  margin,  the  Company  evaluates  its  operating  performance  using  the  measure  of  economic  gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not  a  substitute  for  the  Company's  presentation  of  gross  margin,  which  is  the  most  directly  comparable  GAAP  measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to  investors  as  it  is  a  key  operational  measure  reviewed  by  the  Company's  chief  operating  decision  maker.  Economic  gross margin is defined as the sum of energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, or other operating costs.\n\nThe tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 based on the Company's reportable segments:\n\n|                                                                                                          | Year Ended December 31, 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| ($ in millions, except otherwise noted)                                                                  | Texas                          | East                           | West/Other                     | Corporate/ Eliminations        | Total                          |\n| Retail revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  6,061                       | $  1,401                       | $  -

The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged.\n\nThe reversals of acquired gain or loss positions were valued based upon the forward prices on the acquisition date.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 the $95 million gain in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in New York capacity prices, as well as the  reversal  of  previously  recognized  unrealized  losses  on  contracts  that  settled  during  the  period.  The  $214  million  loss  in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by a decrease in the value of open positions as  a  result  of  decreases  in  ERCOT  power  prices  and  heat  rate  contraction,  as  well  as  the  reversal  of  previously  recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 the $33 million gain in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period. The $53 million loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains, partially offset by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of gains on ERCOT heat rate positions due to heat rate expansion.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy  commodities  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020  and  2019.

For the same period in 2019, NRG recorded an income tax benefit of $3.3 billion on pre-tax income of $786 million. The  effective  tax  rate  was  33.0%  and  (424.2)%  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  large benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to a $3.5 billion release of the Company's valuation allowance. Refer to Item 15 - Note 21, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the release in valuation allowance.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, NRG's overall effective tax rate was different than the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to state tax expense, recognition of state valuation allowance on NOLs, and return to provision adjustments.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                         | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions, except effective income tax rate)                                                                                                         | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Income from continuing operations before income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                   | $  761                    | $  786                    |\n| Tax at federal statutory tax rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | 160                       | 165                       |\n| State taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 18                        | 13                        |\n| Deferred impact of state tax rate changes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                       | 2                         | 12                        |\n| Changes in valuation allowance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 24                        | (3,492)                   |\n| Permanent differences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | 8                         | (9)                       |\n| Return to provision adjustments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | 36                        | -                         |\n| Recognition of uncertain tax benefits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                   | 3                         | (10)                      |\n| Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -                         | (13)                      |\n| Income tax expense/(benefit) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                | $  251                    | $  (3,334)                |\n| Effective income tax rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | 33.0 %                    | (424.2) %                 |\n\nThe effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business  mix  of  earnings  and  losses  and  changes  in  valuation  allowances  in  accordance  with  ASC  740, Income  Taxes, or ASC 740.

The increase was primarily driven by $2.9 billion of newly-issued secured and unsecured corporate debt and a $1.5 billion increase in collateral facilities to fund the Direct Energy acquisition. As of February 26, 2021, NRG had $3.8 billion of liquidity available to continue to support its operations. Changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed under the heading Cash Flow Discussion .  Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 were predominantly held in money market funds invested in treasury securities, treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt.\n\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRG's common stockholders, and to fund other liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nOn  July  24,  2020,  Moody's  affirmed  NRG's  corporate  family  rating  of  Ba1,  with  positive  outlook.  The  agency  also affirmed the ratings on all NRG's outstanding debt, including the Ba2 rating on senior unsecured bonds, Baa3 rating on senior secured bonds with fall-away security provisions and Baa2 rating on senior secured bonds without the fall-away feature. On July 27, 2020, S&P upgraded the NRG corporate family rating to BB+ with a stable outlook and senior unsecured rating to BB+.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's current credit ratings:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                      | S&P        | Moody's      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| NRG Energy, Inc. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | BB+ Stable | Ba1 Positive |\n| 3.75% Senior Secured Notes, due 2024 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | BBB-       | Baa3         |\n| 2.00% Senior Secured Notes, due 2025 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | BBB-       | Baa3         |\n| 7.25% Senior Notes, due 2026 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | BB+        | Ba2          |\n| 2.45% Senior Secured Notes, due 2027 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | BBB-       | Baa3         |\n| 6.625% Senior Notes, due 2027 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | BB+        | Ba2          |\n| 5.75% Senior Notes, due 2028 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | BB+        | Ba2          |\n| 3.375% Senior Notes, due 2029 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | BB+        | Ba2          |\n| 4.45% Senior Secured Notes, due 2029 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | BBB-       | Baa3         |\n| 5.25% Senior Notes, due 2029 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | BB+        | Ba2          |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes, due 2031 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | BB+        | Ba2          |\n| Revolving Credit Facility, due 2024 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BBB-       | Baa3         |",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity\n\nThe principal sources of liquidity for NRG's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand,  cash  flows  from  operations  and  financing  arrangements.  As  described  in  Item  15  Note  14, Long-term  Debt  and Finance Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes.\n\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized  by  the  following:  (i)  market  operations  activities;  (ii)  debt  service  obligations,  as  described  more  fully  in Item 15 -  Note 14, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases , to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with return of capital and dividend payments to shareholders as described in Item 15 -  Note 17, Capital Structure ,  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements, acquisition opportunities, and debt repayments.\n\n## Direct Energy Acquisition\n\nOn July 24, 2020, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Centrica plc to acquire Direct Energy, a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthens its integrated model.

The Company intends to fund the repurchase from cash from operations. NRG continues to look at optimizing its debt structure and seeking out lower interest rates.\n\n## Market Operations\n\nThe Company's market operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions; and (v) collateral for project development. As of December 31, 2020, market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $50 million and $768 million outstanding in letters  of  credit  to  third  parties  primarily  to  support  its  market  activities  for  both  wholesale  and  retail  transactions.  As  of December 31, 2020, total funds deposited by counterparties was $19 million in cash and $75 million of letters of credit.\n\nFuture  liquidity  requirements,  including  those  related  to  the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy,  may  change  based  on  the Company's hedging activities and structures, power purchases and sales, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.",

        "page_content": "## First Lien Structure\n\nNRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors of its senior debt. NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that  it  would  otherwise  be  required  to  post  from  time  to  time  to  support  its  obligations  under  out-of-the-money  hedge agreements for forward sales of power or gas used as a proxy for power. To the extent that the underlying hedge positions for a counterparty are out-of-the-money to NRG, the counterparty would have a claim under the first lien program. The first lien program limits the volume that can be hedged, not the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. Within the first lien structure, the Company can  hedge  up  to  80%  of  its  coal  and  nuclear  capacity  and  10%  of  its  other  assets  with  these  counterparties  for  the  first 60 months and then declining thereafter. Net exposure to a counterparty on all trades must be positively correlated to the price of the relevant commodity for the first lien to be available to that counterparty. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.\n\nThe Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2020, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  amount  of  MW  hedged  against  the  Company's  coal  and  nuclear  assets  and  as  a percentage relative to the Company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as of December 31, 2020:\n\n| Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First Lien Structure  (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| In MW . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 692    | 803    | 801    | 0      |\n| As a percentage of total net coal and nuclear capacity  (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                        | 15%    | 18%    | 18%    | -%     |\n\n## Small Book Acquisitions\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Company  acquired  multiple  books  of  customers  totaling  approximately  56,000  customers  for  $22 million.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  Company's  capital  expenditures  for  maintenance,  environmental,  and  growth investments for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                        | Maintenance   | Environmental   | Growth  Investments (a)   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| Texas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | $  (99)  $    | (1)             | $  (30)  $                | (130)   |\n| East . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (20)          | (2)             | (23)                      | (45)    |\n| West/Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | (30)          | -               | -                         | (30)    |\n| Corporate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | (7)           | -               | (18)                      | (25)    |\n| Total capital expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | (156)         | (3)             | (71)                      | (230)   |\n| Other investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | -             | -               | (32)                      | (32)    |\n| Total capital expenditures and investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                           | $  (156)  $   | (3)             | $  (103)  $               | (262)   |\n\nGrowth investments in East for the year ended December 31, 2020 include the Astoria generating facility, for which the Company has proposed to replace existing units with a single, new state-of-the-art Simple Cycle Combustion Turbine having a total  generating capacity of 437 MW. The Company is working to obtain the permits and regulatory approvals necessary to commence  construction  of  the  project.  NRG  is  targeting  2023  for  commercial  operation.  Additionally,  included  in  other investments  are  expenditures  for  Encina  site  improvements  classified  as  ARO  payments.  Demolition  at  the  Encina  site  is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022. The Company expects to initiate the planning and marketing process of the Encina site in 2021.\n\n## Environmental Capital Expenditures Estimate\n\nNRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2021 through 2025 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $61 million. These costs are primarily associated with the cost of complying with the federal CCR rule and ash storage projects.",

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company utilized U.S. federal NOLs of $134 million due to current year taxable income. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has cumulative U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $10.1 billion, which will begin expiring in 2031 and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of $5.4 billion. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $347 million, which do not have an expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $14 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $384 million of tax credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, primarily due to state and local jurisdictions, of up to $26 million in 2021.\n\nThe Company has $15 million of tax effected uncertain state tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a noncurrent tax liability of $18 million (including accrued interest) until such final resolution with the related taxing authority.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2017. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2012.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n## Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts\n\nNRG and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate market transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial and performance guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees,  surety  bonds  and  indemnifications.  See  also  Item  15  Note  28, Guarantees, to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## Retained or Contingent Interests\n\nNRG does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.\n\n## Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity\n\nVariable interest in Equity investments -  As of December 31, 2020, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest  percentage  of  50%  or  less  in  energy  and  energy-related  entities  that  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting. Ivanpah is considered a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary.\n\nNRG's  pro-rata  share  of  non-recourse  debt  held  by  unconsolidated  affiliates  was  approximately  $829  million  as  of December 31, 2020. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See  also  Item  15  Note  18, Investments  Accounted  for  by  the  Equity  Method  and  Variable  Interest  Entities, to  the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.",

These Senior Notes and Senior Secured First Lien Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the 'Guarantors'). See Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.\n\nNRG  conducts  much  of  its  business  through  and  derives  much  of  its  income  from  its  subsidiaries.  Therefore,  the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the 'Non-Guarantors'). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.\n\nIn March 2020, the SEC adopted final rules that amend the financial disclosure requirements for subsidiary issuers and guarantees  of  registered  debt  securities  under  Rule  3-10  of  Regulation  S-X,  permitting  registrants  to  disclose  summarized financial information for each subsidiary issuer and guarantor. These final rules were codified in Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X.",

Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk , NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict  risk  of  loss  based  on  market  price  and  volatility.  NRG's  risk  management  policy  places  a  limit  on  one-day  holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2020, NRG's net derivative liability was $63 million, a decrease to total fair value of $130 million as compared to December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by roll-off trades that settled during the period, as well as losses in fair value.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $102 million in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $105 million in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nNRG's  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  based  upon  the  Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities.  The  application  of  these  policies  involves  judgments  regarding  future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have  a  significant  effect,  not  only  on  the  operation  of  the  business,  but  on  the  results  reported  through  the  application  of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, NRG evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.\n\nNRG's significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 -  Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.",

ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivative instruments  immediately  in  earnings.  In  certain  cases,  NRG  may  apply  hedge  accounting  to  the  Company's  derivative instruments. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether the overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between the changes in fair  value  of  the  derivative  instrument  and  the  underlying  hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives instruments accounted for as hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur.\n\nFor purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, NRG uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.\n\nUpon repayment of the Term Loan in 2019, all of the Company's interest rate swaps were terminated. During the fourth quarter of 2020, NRG entered into $1.6 billion of interest rate hedges associated with anticipated certain financing needs. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate hedges were settled in connection with the issuance of fixed rate debt,  resulting in a gain of $11 million that was recorded as a reduction to interest expense. In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions prior to termination, NRG estimated the forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time  period.  Judgments  related  to  the  probability  of  forecasted  borrowings  were  based  on  the  estimated  timing  of  project construction, which can vary based on various factors. The probability that forecasted borrowings will occur by the end of a specified  time  period  could  change  the  results  of  operations  by  requiring  amounts  classified  in  OCI  to  be  reclassified  into earnings, creating increased variability in the Company's earnings.\n\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption",

        "page_content": "that NRG has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on expected  load  requirements,  available  baseload  capacity,  internal  forecasts  of  sales  and  generation  and  historical  physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.\n\n## Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  NRG's  deferred  tax  assets  were  primarily  the  result  of  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOLs,  the difference  between  book  and  tax  basis  in  property,  plant,  and  equipment,  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.  The  realization  of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax  assets  requires  judgment  in  assessing  the  likely  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  the Company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\n\nA valuation allowance of $266 million and $242 million was recorded against NRG's gross deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, NRG released the majority  of  its  valuation  allowance  against  its  U.S.  federal  and  state  deferred  tax  assets,  resulting  in  a  non-cash  benefit  to income tax expense of approximately $3.5 billion.\n\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation  allowance  are  appropriate  considering  changes  in  facts  or  circumstances.  As  of  each  reporting  date,  management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the Company's deferred tax assets. In making the determination to release the majority of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019, the Company evaluated a number of factors, including its recent history of pre-tax earnings, utilization of $593 million of NOLs in 2019, as well as its forecasted future pre-tax earnings. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that its future U.S. federal tax benefits are more-likely-than-not to be realized. Given the Company's current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\n\nNRG continues to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $266 million as of December 31, 2020 against net deferred tax assets consisting of state net operating losses and foreign NOL carryforwards in jurisdictions where the Company does not currently believe that the realization of its deferred tax assets is more likely than not.\n\nConsiderable  judgment  is  required  to  determine  the  tax  treatment  of  a  particular  item  that  involves  interpretations  of complex tax laws, including the impact of the Tax Act effective December 22, 2017. NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities  for  income  tax  returns  filed  in  the  U.S.  federal  jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including operations located in Australia and Canada. NRG continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2017. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2012.\n\n## Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value\n\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , or ASC 360, NRG evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n- \u00b7 Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n- \u00b7 Adverse business climate;\n- \u00b7 Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n- \u00b7 Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n- \u00b7 Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net  cash  flows  expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the",

        "page_content": "impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nFor assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets heldfor-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. NRG considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such  information,  the  Company  may  consider  prices  of  similar  assets,  consult  with  brokers,  or  employ  other  valuation techniques.  NRG  will  also  discount  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  associated  with  the  asset  using  a  single  interest  rate representative  of  the  risk  involved  with  such  an  investment  or  asset.  The  use  of  these  methods  involves  the  same  inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company concluded its Home Solar business was held for sale as a result of advanced negotiations  to  sell  the  business  and  recorded  an  impairment  loss  of  $29  million  in  the  West/Other  segment  to  adjust  the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities to fair market value based on indicative sale prices. On November 13, 2020, the Company completed the sale of the Home Solar business for $66 million.\n\nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the Company's projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Company  identified  a  long-lived  asset  impairment  related  to  the  Cottonwood  facility,  as  further described in Item 15 -  Note 11 , Asset Impairments . The Company recognized an impairment loss of $32 million in 2020 in the West/Other segment associated with the Company's long-term services agreement and related lease payments, as the carrying amounts of the assets from the contract were higher than the estimated operating cash flow though the remaining lease period.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\nNRG  is  also  required  to  evaluate  its  equity  method  investments  to  determine  whether  or  not  they  are  impaired  in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures , or ASC 323. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether a decline in the value is considered an other-than-temporary decline in  value.  The  evaluation  and  measurement  of  impairments  under  ASC  323  involves  the  same  uncertainties  as  described  for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that NRG makes with respect to its equity method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, NRG would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under ASC 323. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $18 million in the Texas segment, which included the anticipated drawdown of the $12 million letter of credit posted in September 2019 to cover certain project debt reserve requirements.\n\n## Other Impairments\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $14 million of impairment losses related to intangible assets in the Texas segment.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nAt  December  31,  2020,  NRG  reported  goodwill  of  $579  million,  consisting  of  $165  million  associated  with  the acquisition of Midwest Generation and $414 million for retail operations acquisitions, including Stream Energy and XOOM, which were acquired in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThe  Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations ,  or  ASC  805,  and  ASC 350, to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit",

        "page_content": "level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit may be below the carrying amount. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, where necessary, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.\n\nThe Company performed its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of the Texas (Texas segment) and East Retail (East segment) reporting units. The Company determined it was more-likely-than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed to these reporting units were more than their carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment existed for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe  Company  performed  a  quantitative  assessment  for  the  Midwest  Generation  (East  segment)  reporting  unit.  The Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit's cash flow exceeded its carrying value and, as such, the Company concluded that goodwill associated with the reporting unit was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Company believes the methodology and assumptions used in its quantitative assessments were consistent with the views of market participants. Significant inputs to the determinations of fair value were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Company  applied  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  to  the  long-term  budgets  for  the  Midwest  Generation plants, resulting in fair value over the carrying value of the reporting unit of 115%. The significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:\n- \u00b7 The Company's views of power, capacity and fuel prices consider market prices for the next five years and the Company's fundamental view for the longer term, driven by the Company's long-term view of the price of natural gas. The Company's fundamental view for the longer term reflects the implied prices and heat rate that would support new build of a combined cycle gas plant. The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;\n- \u00b7 The  Company's  estimate  of  generation,  fuel  costs,  capital  expenditure  requirements  and  the  existing  and anticipated impact of environmental regulations;\n- \u00b7 The Company's fundamental view for the longer term, cash flows for the plants in the region were included in the fair value calculation through the end of each plants' estimated useful life; and\n- \u00b7 Projected  generation  and  resulting  energy  gross  margin  in  the  long-term  budgets  is  based  on  an  hourly dispatch  that  simulates  dispatch  of  each  unit  into  the  power  market.  The  dispatch  simulation  is  based  on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant\n\nFair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying  assumptions  and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nNRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and  the  amount  of  the  loss,  or  range  of  loss,  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  Gain  contingencies  are  not  recorded  until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 -  Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments\n\nSee  Item  15  Note  2, Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies, to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a discussion of recent accounting developments.",

        "page_content": "## Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may  result  from  market  changes  associated  with  the  Company's  retail  operations,  merchant  power  generation,  or  with  an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks, the Company uses various fixed-price forward purchase and sales contracts, futures and option contracts traded on NYMEX, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:\n\n- \u00b7 Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;\n- \u00b7 Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and\n- \u00b7 Hedge fuel requirements for the Company's generating facilities.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nCommodity  price  risks  result  from  exposures  to  changes  in  spot  prices,  forward  prices,  volatilities,  and  correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's merchant generation operations and load serving obligations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative  instruments  to  hedge  the  variability  in  future  cash  flows  from  forecasted  sales  and  purchases  of  electricity, natural gas and fuel. These instruments include forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts traded on various exchanges, such as NYMEX and ICE, as well as over-the-counter markets. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management's assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors.\n\nWhile some of the contracts the Company uses to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available  from  external  sources,  other  commodities  and  certain  contracts  are  not  actively  traded  and  are  valued  using  other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices, contract quantities, or both. NRG uses the Company's best estimates  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  those  derivative  contracts.  However,  it  is  likely  that  future  market prices could vary from those used in recording mark-to-market derivative instrument valuation and such variations could be material.\n\nNRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports, and VaR. NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss  in  the  fair  value  of  the  Company's  energy  assets  and  liabilities,  which  includes  generation  assets,  load  obligations,  and bilateral  physical  and  financial  transactions.  The  key  assumptions  for  the  Company's  VaR  model  include:  (i)  lognormal distribution of prices; (ii) one-day holding period; (iii) 95% confidence interval; (iv) rolling 36-month forward looking period; and (v) market implied volatilities and historical price correlations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the VaR for NRG's commodity portfolio, including generation assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions calculated using the VaR model was $30 million.\n\nThe following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                 | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| VaR as of December 31,                                                                                                                                        | $  30  | $  42  |\n| For the year ended December 31,                                                                                                                               |        |        |\n| Average . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  30  | $  44  |\n| Maximum . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 47     | 55     |\n| Minimum . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 22     | 33     |\n\nDue to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VaR, the evolving nature of the competitive markets for electricity and related derivatives, and the seasonality of changes in market prices, the VaR calculation may not capture the full extent of commodity price exposure. As a result, actual changes in the fair value of mark-to-market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated VaR, and such changes could have a material impact on the Company's financial results.\n\nIn  order  to  provide  additional  information,  the  Company  also  uses  VaR  to  estimate  the  potential  loss  of  derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was $13 million as of December 31, 2020, primarily driven by asset-backed transactions.",

        "page_content": "## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to retail credit risk related to its C&I and Mass Market customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the  loss  of  in-the-money  forward  value.  NRG  manages  retail  credit  risk  through  the  use  of  established  credit  policies  that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures, such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to C&I and Mass customers was diversified across  many  customers  and  various  industries,  as  well  as  government  entities.  The  Company's  provision  for  credit  losses resulting from credit risk was $108 million, $95 million and $85 million for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline, primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts as of December 31, 2020, a $0.50 per  MMBtu  decrease  in  natural  gas  prices  across  the  term  of  the  marginable  contracts  would  cause  an  increase  in  margin collateral posted of approximately $226 million and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh decrease in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately $204 million. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established  credit  approval  process;  (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation measures  such  as  margin,  collateral,  prepayment  arrangements,  or  volumetric  limits;  (iv)  the  use  of  payment  netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the  amount  and  timing  of  expected  cash  flows.  The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  counterparty  risk  by  having  a  diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate counterparty credit exposure to a significant portion of the Company's counterparties totaled $210 million, of which the Company held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $14 million resulting  in  a  net  exposure  of  $204  million.  NRG  periodically  receives  collateral  from  counterparties  in  excess  of  their exposure.  Collateral  amounts  shown  include  such  excess  while  net  exposure  shown  excludes  excess  collateral  received. Approximately 54% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2022. The following table highlights the net counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality. Net counterparty credit exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with  counterparties  where  netting  is  permitted  under  the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate credit exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                      | 96 %                                 |\n| Financial institutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 4                                    |\n| Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Investment grade . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 59 %                                 |\n| Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 41                                   |\n| Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |",

        "page_content": "The Company has $47 million of exposure to two wholesale counterparties in excess of 10% of the total net exposure discussed  above  as  of  December  31,  2020.  Changes  in  hedge  positions  and  market  prices  will  affect  credit  exposure  and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, the Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any counterparty.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and include credit  policies  that,  under  certain  circumstances,  require  that  losses  arising  from  the  default  of  one  member  on  spot  market transactions  be  shared  by  the  remaining  participants.  As  a  result,  the  counterparty  credit  risk  to  these  markets  is  limited  to NRG's applicable share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE,  NYMEX  and  Nodal.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long-term contracts, primarily solar PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market  and  extrapolation  of  observable  market  data  with  similar  characteristics.  Based  on  these  valuation  techniques,  as  of December 31, 2020, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $645 million for the next five years.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nNRG was previously  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  through  its  issuance  of  variable  rate  debt.  Exposures  to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and  put  or  call  options.  These  contracts  reduce  exposure  to  interest  rate  volatility  and  result  in  primarily  fixed  rate  debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRG's risk management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations.\n\nThe Company previously entered into interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2019, NRG had no interest rate derivative instruments, as a result of the early termination of such contracts in connection with the repayment of the 2023 Term Loan Facility during the second quarter of 2019.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, NRG entered into $1.6 billion of interest rate hedges associated with anticipated certain financing needs. As of December 31, 2020 the interest rate hedges were settled in connection with the issuance of fixed rate debt resulting in a gain of $11 million that was recorded as a reduction to interest expense.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's debt fair value was $9.4 billion and carrying value was $8.8 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by $765 million.\n\n## Credit Risk Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of the Company's hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed \"adequate assurance\" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a downgrade in the Company's credit rating. The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2020, was $26 million. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately $35 million as of December 31, 2020. If called for  by  the  counterparty,  $1  million  of  additional  collateral  would  be  required  for  all  contracts  with  credit  rating  contingent features as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Currency Exchange Risk\n\nNRG's foreign earnings and investments may be subject to foreign currency exchange risk, which NRG generally does not hedge.  As  these  earnings  and  investments  are  not  material  to  NRG's  consolidated  results,  the  Company's  foreign  currency exposure is limited.",

Based on  this  evaluation,  the  Company's  principal  executive  officer,  principal  financial  officer  and  principal  accounting  officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated under the caption \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" and under the caption \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in NRG's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NRG's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls\n\nNRG's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;\n- 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and\n- 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInternal  control  over  financial  reporting  cannot  provide  absolute  assurance  of  achieving  financial  reporting  objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial reporting,  as  such  term  is  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rule  13a-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the  Company  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company's evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , the  Company's  management  concluded  that  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period  ended  December  31,  2020,  and  the  related  notes  and  financial  statement  schedule  II  (collectively,  the  consolidated financial  statements),  and  our  report  dated  March  1,  2021  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  those  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also, projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania March 1, 2021",

Mission Del Sol owns one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding membership interests of Sunrise Power Company, LLC (together with Long Beach, the \"California Project Companies\"). Arthur Kill, Connecticut Jet Power, Devon, Middletown, Montville and Oswego, together with the California Project Companies, are referred to as the \"Project Companies\".\n\n## Consideration\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, NRG has agreed to sell, or cause to be sold, as applicable, to  Generation  all  of  the  outstanding  membership  interests  of  the  Subsidiaries  for  an  aggregate  base  purchase  price  of  $760 million,  subject  to  adjustments  for  working  capital,  indebtedness,  and  certain  operations  of  the  Holdcos  and  the  Project Companies during the interim period between the date of the Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction (the \"Closing\").\n\n## Representations and Warranties and Covenants\n\nThe Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of NRG and Generation. The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of the other party to the Purchase Agreement, and such representations and warranties should not be relied on by any other person. In addition, such representations and warranties (a) have been qualified by disclosure schedules that the parties have delivered in connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, (b) are subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Purchase Agreement, which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors, (c) in certain cases, were made as of a specific date, and (d) may have  been  used  for  purposes  of  allocating  risk  between  the  respective  parties  rather  than  establishing  matters  of  fact. Accordingly,  no  person  should  rely  on  the  representations  and  warranties  as  characterizations  of  the  actual  state  of  facts. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the execution of the Purchase Agreement.\n\nGeneration has agreed to obtain, at its sole cost, a representation and warranty insurance policy. As a result, NRG will not be liable for any breach of its representations and warranties that occurs after the Closing.\n\nBetween the date of the Purchase Agreement and the Closing, subject to certain exceptions, NRG agrees to cause the Holdcos and the Project Companies to be operated in the ordinary course of business consistent with laws and permits and past practice and to use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve, maintain and protect the assets and business of the Holdcos and the Project Companies.\n\nFollowing the Closing, NRG will be required to pay all costs incurred by Generation or the applicable Project Companies arising  out  of  or  related  to  certain  environmental  liabilities  (the  \"Specific  Environmental  Liabilities\")  relating  to  certain remedial actions or the ownership of the Project Companies or the generation facilities owned by the Project Companies, other than certain costs to decommission such facilities, prior to the date of the Closing (the \"Closing Date\"), subject to a $39 million cap established as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the \"Seller Environmental Liability Cap\"). NRG's obligations to pay such costs will terminate on the earlier to occur of the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date and the date on which NRG has paid  Generation  an  amount  equal  to  the  Seller  Environmental  Liability  Cap,  subject  to  an  extension  of  such  term  and  a corresponding increase in the Seller Environmental Liability Cap to the extent there are remaining costs to address Specific Environmental Liabilities that have been reasonably estimated but not yet incurred prior to such anniversary date.\n\n## Conditions to Closing and Deliverables\n\nThe  Transaction  is  subject  to  various  conditions  to  Closing,  including:  (a)  the  accuracy  of  the  representations  and warranties of each party at the time of Closing, (b) compliance by each party with its covenants), (c) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Closing, (d) certain contractual consents having been obtained, (e) receipt of certain regulatory approvals, as necessary (including HSR, FERC, and NYSPSC authorizations), and (f) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect",

In  addition,  ArcLight  Energy  Partners  Fund  VII,  L.P.,  the  parent company  of  Generation,  has  executed  and  delivered  a  parent  guaranty  with  respect  to  the  obligations  of  Generation  in connection with the Transaction.\n\n## Indemnification and Termination\n\nBoth NRG and Generation have agreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify the other party for losses arising from certain  breaches  of  the  Purchase  Agreement.  In  addition,  NRG  has  agreed  to  indemnify  Generation  for  liabilities  related  to certain environmental matters and certain ongoing actions or proceedings, among other things.\n\nThe  Purchase  Agreement  contains  certain  customary  termination  rights  for  each  of  NRG  and  Generation,  including among other things, that either party may terminate the Purchase Agreement if (a) the parties mutually agree in writing, (b) the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2021, which date may be extended for an additional 90 days to enable the parties to satisfy certain regulatory conditions, or (c) the other party has incurably breached a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the Purchase Agreement resulting in a failure of a condition set forth in the Purchase Agreement. If NRG terminates the Purchase Agreement as a result of a breach by Generation of certain representations, warranties covenants or other agreements, Generation will be required to pay NRG a termination fee equal to 10 percent of the purchase price as adjusted in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.\n\n## Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers\n\nAs  previously  disclosed  in  a  Current  Report  on  Form  8-K,  filed  with  the  SEC  on  February  4,  2021,  the  Company announced that Ga\u00ebtan Frott\u00e9 was appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective February 4, 2021.

Curci,  the  Senior  Vice President and General Counsel, to Executive Vice President and General Counsel, effective on February 22, 2021. Mr. Curci will continue to be responsible for the day-to-day legal operations of the Company.\n\nIn addition, on March 1, 2021, the Compensation Committee approved changes to Mr. Curci's annual compensation. Mr. Curci's annual base salary increased to $500,000 effective February 22, 2021.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over operating revenues\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  had  $9,093  million  of  operating revenues.  Operating  revenue  is  derived  from  various  revenue  streams  in  different  geographic  markets  and  the Company's processes and related information technology (IT) systems used to record revenue differ for each of these revenue streams.",

        "page_content": "We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of  audit  evidence  over  operating  revenues  as  a  critical  audit  matter which required a high degree of auditor judgment due to the number of revenue streams and IT systems involved in the revenue  recognition  process.  This  included  determining  the  revenue  streams  over  which  procedures  were  to  be performed and evaluating the nature and extent of evidence obtained over the individual revenue streams as well as operating revenue in the aggregate. It also included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the performance of certain procedures.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.  We, with the assistance of IT professionals, applied auditor judgment to determine the revenue streams over which procedures were performed as well as the nature and extent of such procedures. For each revenue stream over which procedures were performed, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's revenue recognition processes; involved IT professionals, who assisted in testing certain IT applications used by the Company in its revenue recognition processes; and assessed the recorded revenue by selecting transactions and comparing the amounts recognized to underlying documentation, including contracts with customers. In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency  of  audit  evidence  obtained  over  operating  revenues  by  assessing  the  results  of  procedures  performed, including the appropriateness of such evidence .\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2004.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania March 1, 2021",

NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services in major competitive power and gas markets in the U.S. and Canada in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders.  NRG  is  a  customer-centric  business  focused  on  perfecting  the  integrated  model  by  balancing  retail  load  with generation  supply  within  its  deregulated  markets.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Company  sold  energy,  services,  and innovative,  sustainable  products  and  services  directly  to  retail  customers  under  the  names  NRG,  Reliant,  Green  Mountain Energy, Stream and XOOM Energy, as well as other brand names owned by NRG, supported by approximately 23,000 MW of generation.\n\nNRG also conducts business under the brand name of Direct Energy as a result of the Company's acquisition of Direct Energy,  a  North  American  subsidiary  of  Centrica  plc,  on  January  5,  2021.  Direct  Energy  is  a  leading  retail  provider  of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S.  states  and  8  Canadian  provinces.  Following  the  acquisition,  the  Company  serves  more  than  6  million  customers.  In addition,  Direct  Energy  is  a  participant  in  the  wholesale  gas  and  power  markets  in  the  United  States  and  Canada.    Note  4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions for further discussion of the acquisition of Direct Energy.\n\nThe Company began managing its integrated model based on the combined results of the retail and wholesale generation businesses  with  a  geographical  focus  in  2020.  As  a  result,  the  Company  changed  its  business  segments  from  Retail  and Generation to Texas, East and West/Other beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The Company's updated segment structure reflects how management makes financial decisions and allocates resources.\n\nThe Company's businesses are segregated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas;\n- \u00b7 East, which includes the remaining activity related to customer operations and all activity related to plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Other, which includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to plant and market operations in the West, (ii) activity related to the Cottonwood power plant that was sold to Cleco on February 4, 2019 and is being leased back until 2025, (iii) the remaining renewables activity, including the Company's equity method investments in Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC and Agua Caliente (which was sold on February 3, 2021), the remaining Home Solar assets  (which  were  primarily  sold  on  November  13,  2020)  and  the  NFL  stadium  solar  generating  assets,  and  (iv) activity related to the Company's equity method investment for the Gladstone power plant in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.\n\nAll affected disclosures presented herein have been recast to reflect these changes for all periods presented. For further discussion of segment reporting, refer to Note 20, Segment Reporting .\n\nThe acquired operations of Direct Energy will be integrated into the existing NRG segment structure. Domestic customer and market operations will be combined into the corresponding geographical segments of Texas, East and West/Other. The East segment will also include the deregulated customer and market operations of Canada. The West/Other segment will also include activity related to the regulated operations in Alberta, Canada and the services businesses.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nIn  March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic and the President of the United States  declared  the  COVID-19  outbreak  a  national  emergency.  Electricity  was  deemed  a  'critical  and  essential  business operation' under various state and federal governmental COVID-19 mandates. NRG had activated its Crisis Management Team (\"CMT\") in January 2020 to proactively manage the Company's response to the impacts of COVID-19.\n\nNRG  continues  to  remain  focused  on  protecting  the  health  and  well-being  of  its  employees,  while  supporting  its customers and the communities in which it operates and assuring the continuity of its operations. In June 2020, summer-critical office employees returned to the offices and safety protocols were successfully implemented.\n\nThe Company continues to maintain certain restrictions on business travel and face-to-face sales channels, remote work practices  remain  in  place  and  there  are  enhanced  cleaning  and  hygiene  protocols  in  all  of  its  facilities.  In  addition,  select essential employees and contractors are continuing to report to plant and certain office locations. The Company also continues to  require  pre-entry  screening,  including  temperature  checks,  separation  of  work  crews,  additional  personal  protective\n\n## NRG ENERGY, INC.

The Company has not experienced any material disruptions in its ability to continue its business operations to date.\n\nThe  first  COVID-19  vaccine  became  available  in  the  United  States  in  December  2020.  NRG  continues  to  advocate alongside state and federal trade groups for the high prioritization of essential electric industry personnel for inoculation against COVID-19. States are receiving weekly doses of vaccines and allocating those doses to frontline healthcare workers, elderly populations and high risk individuals. NRG continues to monitor state information, as well as dosage and allocation numbers to anticipate the latest timing of vaccine distribution to our essential employees. The Company will continue to evaluate additional return to normal work operations on a location-by-location basis as COVID-19 conditions evolve.\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nOn  December  31,  2018,  as  described  in  Note  4, Acquisitions,  Discontinued  Operations  and  Dispositions , the Company concluded that the sale of its South Central Portfolio to Cleco, excluding the Cottonwood facility, met held-for-sale criteria and should be presented as a discontinued operation, as the sale represented a strategic shift in the business in which NRG operates. The financial information for all historical periods was recast in 2018 to reflect the presentation of these entities as discontinued operations.\n\nOn  August  31,  2018,  as  described  in  Note  4, Acquisitions,  Discontinued  Operations  and  Dispositions ,  the  Company deconsolidated NRG Yield, Inc. and its Renewables Platform for financial reporting purposes. The financial information for all historical periods was recast in 2018 to reflect the presentation of these entities, as well as the Carlsbad project, as discontinued operations. As a result of the sale of NRG Yield, the Company no longer controls the Agua Caliente project. Due to this change in control, the Company deconsolidated the Agua Caliente project from its financial results and began accounting for the project as an equity method investment.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  The  ASC, established by the FASB, is the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. In addition, the rules  and  interpretative  releases  of  the  SEC  under  authority  of  federal  securities  laws  are  also  sources  of  authoritative  U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include NRG's accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company  has  a  controlling  interest.  All  significant  intercompany  transactions  and  balances  have  been  eliminated  in consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity.  However,  a  controlling  financial  interest  may  also  exist  through  arrangements  that  do  not  involve  controlling  voting interests. As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810, Consolidations, or  ASC 810, to determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests, referred to as a VIE, should be consolidated.\n\n## Net Income/(Loss) attributable to NRG Energy, Inc.\n\nThe following table reflects the net income/(loss) attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. after removing the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest:\n\n|                                                                                                            | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                              | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Income from continuing operations, net of income tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  510                    | $  4,117                  | $  465                    |\n| Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | -                         | 321                       | (197)                     |\n| Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. stockholders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  510                    | $  4,438                  | $  268                    |\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.\n\n## Funds Deposited by Counterparties\n\nFunds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by the Company as a result of collateral posting obligations from its  counterparties. Some amounts are segregated into separate accounts that are not contractually restricted but, based on the Company's intention, are not available for the payment of general corporate obligations. Depending on market fluctuations and the settlement of the underlying contracts, the Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades.

Following the adoption of the new standard, the Company's process of estimating expected credit losses remains materially consistent with its historical practice. Information prior to January 1, 2020, which was previously referred to as the allowance and provision for bad debt, has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period.\n\nRetail trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet net of the allowance for credit losses. The Company accrues an allowance for current expected credit losses based on (i) estimates of uncollectible revenues by analyzing accounts receivable aging and current and reasonable forecasts of expected economic factors including, but not limited to, unemployment rates and weather-related  events,  (ii)  historical  collections  and  delinquencies,  and  (iii)  counterparty  credit  ratings  for  commercial  and industrial  customers.  The  Company  writes  off  customer  contract  receivable  balances  against  the  allowance  for  credit  losses when it is determined a receivable is uncollectible.\n\nThe following table represents the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                              | Year Ended December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Beginning balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  43                          |\n| Provision for credit losses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 108                            |\n| Write-offs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (101)                          |\n| Recoveries collected . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | 17                             |\n| Ending balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | $  67                          |\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nThe  following  table  provides  a  reconciliation  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  funds  deposited  by counterparties reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                       | $  3,905                  | $  345                    | $  563                    |\n| Funds deposited by counterparties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                             | 19                        | 32                        | 33                        |\n| Restricted cash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                               | 6                         | 8                         | 17                        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties and restricted cash shown  in the statements of cash flows . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  3,930                  | $  385                    | $  613                    |\n\nRestricted cash consists primarily of funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use.\n\n## Inventory\n\nInventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and consists principally of fuel oil, coal and raw materials used to generate electricity or steam. The Company removes these inventories as they are used in the production of electricity or steam. Spare parts inventory is valued at weighted average cost. The Company removes these inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects. The Company expects to recover the fuel oil, coal, raw materials, and spare parts costs in the ordinary course of business. Finished goods inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with  cost  being  determined  on  a  first-in  first-out  basis.  The  Company  removes  these  inventories  as  they  are  sold  to customers. Sales of inventory are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of business acquisitions, fair value; however, impairment adjustments  are  recorded  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  their  carrying  values  may  not  be recoverable. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the Company's 44% ownership interest in STP as part of the Company's property, plant, and equipment. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized as incurred, while repairs  and  maintenance  that  do  not  improve  or  extend  the  life  of  the  respective  asset  are  charged  to  expense  as  incurred. Depreciation, other than nuclear fuel, is computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is amortized based on units",

Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Asset Impairments\n\nLong-lived  assets  that  are  held  and  used  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360. An impairment loss is  indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an asset's carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in  operating  costs  and  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Fair  values  are  determined  by  a  variety  of valuation methods, including third-party appraisals, sales prices of similar assets, and present value techniques.\n\nInvestments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 323, InvestmentsEquity Method and Joint Ventures ,  or  ASC  323,  which  requires  that  a  loss  in  value  of  an  investment  that  is  an  other-thantemporary  decline  should  be  recognized.  The  Company  identifies  and  measures  losses  in  the  value  of  equity  method investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value. For further discussion of these matters, refer to Note 11, Asset Impairments .\n\n## Development Costs and Capitalized Interest\n\nDevelopment  costs  include  project  development  costs,  which  are  expensed  in  the  preliminary  stages  of  a  project  and capitalized when the project is deemed to be commercially viable. Commercial viability is determined by one or a series of actions including, among others, Board of Director approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the Company to significant  future  obligations  that  can  only  be  discharged  by  the  use  of  a  Company  asset.  When  a  project  is  available  for operations, capitalized interest and capitalized project development costs are reclassified to property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the project's related assets. Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be unrecoverable.\n\nInterest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects is capitalized until the project under construction is ready for its intended use. The amount of interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $2 million, $3 million and $7 million, respectively.\n\n## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nDebt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, or as an asset if the issuance costs relate to revolving debt agreements or certain other financing arrangements.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible  assets  represent  contractual  rights  held  by  the  Company.  The  Company  recognizes  specifically  identifiable intangible assets including customer contracts, customer relationships, energy supply contracts, marketing partnerships, trade names, emission allowances, and fuel contracts when specific rights  and  contracts  are  acquired.  These  intangible  assets  are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units of production  basis.  As  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Company  had  accumulated  amortization  related  to  its  intangible assets of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\n\nEmission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ,  or  ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company first assesses qualitative factors to  determine  whether  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment.",

        "page_content": "In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that no impairment occurred, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value.\n\nFor  further  discussion  of  goodwill  and  goodwill  impairment  losses  recognized  refer  to  Note  12, Goodwill  and  Other Intangibles.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using  the  liability  method  in  accordance  with  ASC  740, Income  Taxes, or ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences.\n\nThe Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit - current and deferred, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and\n- \u00b7 Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income\n\nThe Company reports some of its revenues and expenses differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax return purposes, resulting in temporary and permanent differences between the Company's financial statements and income tax returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company measures its deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the deferred tax is realized.\n\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to  income  taxes.  Under  ASC  740,  tax  benefits  are  recognized  when  it  is  more-likely-than-not  that  a  tax  position  will  be sustained  upon  examination  by  the  authorities.  The  benefit  recognized  from  a  position  is  the  amount  of  benefit  that  has surpassed  the  more-likely-than-not  threshold,  as  it  is  more  than  50%  likely  to  be  realized  upon  settlement.  The  Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\nIn  accordance  with  ASC 805 and as discussed further in Note 21, Income Taxes ,  changes  to  existing  net  deferred  tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax benefits, are recorded to income tax (benefit)/expense.\n\n## Contract Amortization\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized through acquisitions related to the sale of electric capacity and energy in future periods for which the fair value has been determined to be significantly less or more than market are amortized to cost of operations over the term of each underlying contract based on actual generation and/or contracted volumes.\n\n## Lease Revenue\n\nCertain of the Company's revenues are obtained through leases of rooftop residential solar systems, which are accounted for  as  operating  leases  in  accordance  with  ASC  842, Leases. Pursuant  to  the  lease  agreements,  the  customers'  monthly payments  are  pre-determined  fixed  monthly  amounts  and  may  include  an  annual  fixed  percentage  escalation  to  reflect  the impact  of  utility  rate  increases  over  the  lease  term,  which  is  20  years.  The  Company  records  operating  lease  revenue  on  a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term. Certain customers made initial down payments that are being amortized over the life of the lease. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue.\n\n## Lessor Accounting\n\nCertain of the Company's revenues are obtained through PPAs or other contractual agreements. Many of these agreements are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 .\n\nCertain of these leases have no minimum lease payments and all of the rent is recorded as contingent rent on an actual basis  when  the  electricity  is  delivered.  Judgment  is  required  by  management  in  determining  the  economic  life  of  each generating facility, in evaluating whether certain lease provisions constitute minimum payments or represent contingent rent and other factors in determining whether a contract contains a lease and whether the lease is an operating lease or finance lease. Contingent rental income under ASC 840 was $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\n## Gross Receipts and Sales Taxes\n\nIn  connection  with  its  retail  sales,  the  Company  records  gross  receipts  taxes  on  a  gross  basis  in  revenues  and  cost  of operations  in  its  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,  the Company's  revenues  and  cost  of  operations  included  gross  receipts  taxes  of  $107  million,  $109  million  and  $99  million,",

Additionally,  the  Company  records  sales  taxes  collected  from  its  taxable  retail  customers  and  remitted  to  the various governmental entities on a net basis; thus, there is no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\n\n## Purchased Energy and Other Cost of Sales for Customer Operations\n\nThe cost of energy for electricity sales and services to retail customers is included in cost of operations and is based on actual and estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. A portion of the cost of energy, $98 million, $103 million  and  $105  million  as  of  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,  respectively,  was  accrued  and  consisted  of  estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities. In estimating supply volumes, the Company considers the effects of historical customer volumes, weather factors and usage by customer class. Transmission and distribution delivery fees are estimated using the same method used for electricity sales and services to retail customers. In addition,  ISO  fees  are  estimated  based  on  historical  trends,  estimated  supply  volumes  and  initial  ERCOT  ISO  settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable reporting period.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company accounts for derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge derivatives are immediately recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, if elected for hedge accounting, are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated OCI until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.\n\nThe Company's primary derivative instruments are power purchase or sales contracts, fuels purchase contracts, and other energy related commodities used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in market prices and interest rates. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of all derivatives that are designated as hedges for accounting purposes in order to determine that each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Internal analyses that measure the statistical correlation between the derivative and the associated hedged item determine the effectiveness of such a contract designated as a hedge. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly  effective  as  a  hedge,  hedge  accounting  will  be  discontinued  prospectively.  In  this  case,  the  gain  or  loss  previously deferred in accumulated OCI would be frozen until the underlying hedged instrument is delivered unless the transactions being hedged are no longer probable of occurring in which case the amount in OCI would be immediately reclassified into earnings. If the derivative instrument is terminated, the effective portion of this derivative deferred in accumulated OCI will be frozen until the underlying hedged item is delivered. The Company had no cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2020.\n\nRevenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized when the underlying physical transaction  is  delivered.  While  these  contracts  are  considered  derivative  financial  instruments  under  ASC  815,  they  are  not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.\n\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are  recognized  on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value  and  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  derivative  financial  instruments  are recognized in earnings.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\n\nThe local currencies are generally the functional currency of NRG's foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the weighted-average  rates  of  exchange  for  the  period.  The  resulting  currency  translation  adjustments  are  not  included  in  the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign entity takes place. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported within other income/(expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction  gains/(losses)  were  immaterial.  The  Company's  cumulative  translation  adjustment  balances  as  of  December  31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $(2) million, $(13) million and $(13) million, respectively.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial  instruments  which  potentially  subject  the  Company  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  trust funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives, and investments in debt securities. Trust funds are held in accounts managed  by  experienced  investment  advisors.  Certain  accounts  receivable,  notes  receivable,  and  derivative  instruments  are concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Receivables and other contractual arrangements are subject to collateral requirements under the",

        "page_content": "terms of enabling agreements. However, the Company believes that the credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the diversification and creditworthiness of its customer base. See Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for  a  further discussion of derivative concentrations.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. See Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for a further discussion of fair value of financial instruments.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  AROs  in  accordance  with  ASC  410-20, Asset  Retirement  Obligations, or  ASC  410-20. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of ASC 410-20 are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC 410-20 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\n\nUpon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. Over time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the  capitalized  cost  is  depreciated  over  the  useful  life  of  the  related  asset.  See  Note  15, Asset Retirement Obligations, for  a further discussion of AROs.\n\n## Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\nThe  Company  offers  pension  benefits  through  a  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  In  addition,  the  Company  provides postretirement  health  and  welfare  benefits  for  certain  groups  of  employees.  The  Company  accounts  for  pension  and  other postretirement  benefits  in  accordance  with  ASC  715, Compensation  -  Retirement  Benefits ,  or  ASC  715 . The  Company recognizes the funded status of the Company's defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records an offset for gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have not been included as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost  to  other  comprehensive  income.  The  determination  of  the  Company's  obligation  and  expenses  for  pension  benefits  is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. The Company's actuarial consultants assist in determining assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  its  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC  718, Compensation  -  Stock Compensation, or ASC 718 . The fair value of the Company's performance stock units is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo  valuation  model.  NRG  uses  the  Company's  common  stock  price  on  the  date  of  grant  as  the  fair  value  of  the Company's deferred stock units. The fair value of the Company's restricted stock units is derived from the closing price of NRG's  common  stock  at  the  grant  date.  Forfeiture  rates  are  estimated  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  Company's  historical forfeitures,  employment  turnover,  and  expected  future  behavior.  The  Company  recognizes  compensation  expense  for  both graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.\n\n## Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method\n\nThe Company has investments in various domestic energy projects, as well as one Australian project. The equity method of accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents the Company from exercising a controlling influence over the operating and financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of its Australian project, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Distributions from equity method investments that represent earnings on the Company's investment are included within cash flows from operating activities and distributions from  equity  method  investments  that  represent  a  return  of  the  Company's  investment  are  included  within  cash  flows  from investing activities.\n\n## Tax Equity Arrangements\n\nThe Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries represented third-party interests in the net assets under certain tax equity arrangements, which were consolidated by the Company, that had been entered into to finance the cost of solar  energy  systems  under  operating  leases.  The  Company  determined  that  the  provisions  in  the  contractual  agreements  of",

        "page_content": "these structures represented substantive profit sharing arrangements. Further, the Company had determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the redeemable noncontrolling interest that reflected the substantive profit sharing arrangements was a balance sheet approach that utilized the HLBV method. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as redeemable noncontrolling  interests  represented  the  amounts  the  investors  that  were  party  to  the  tax  equity  arrangements  would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual agreements, assuming the net  assets  of  the  funding  structures  were  liquidated  at  their  recorded  amounts.  The  investors'  interests  in  the  results  of operations  of  the  funding  structures  were  determined  as  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  at  the  start  and  end  of  each reporting  period,  after  taking  into  account  any  capital  transactions  between  the  structures  and  the  funds'  investors.  The calculations utilized to apply the HLBV method included estimated calculations of taxable income or losses for each reporting period. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased its partners' equity interest as further described in Note 18, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities . The Company has no remaining tax equity arrangements as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nTo the extent that the third-party has the right to redeem their interests for cash or other assets, the Company had included the noncontrolling interest attributable to the third party as a component of temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated  balance  sheet.  During  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  the  Company  repurchased  its  partners'  equity  interest.  The following  table  reflects  the  changes  in  the  Company's  redeemable  noncontrolling  interest  balance  for  the  years  ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                             | (In millions)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Balance as of December 31, 2017 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  78           |\n| Distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | (3)             |\n| Contributions from redeemable noncontrolling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | 26              |\n| Non-cash adjustments to redeemable noncontrolling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                | (8)             |\n| Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest - continuing operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                               | 1               |\n| Net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest - discontinued operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                           | (27)            |\n| Sale of NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform (a) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | (48)            |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 19              |\n| Distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | (2)             |\n| Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest - continuing operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                               | 3               |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 20              |\n| Repurchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | (20)            |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  -            |\n\n## Sale-Leaseback Arrangements\n\nNRG is party to sale-leaseback arrangements that provide for the sale of certain assets to a third party and simultaneously leases back the same asset to the Company. If the seller-lessee transfers control of the underlying assets to the buyer-lessor, the arrangement is accounted for under ASC 842-40, Sale-Leaseback Transactions. These arrangements are classified as operating leases on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10, Leases, for further discussion.\n\n## Marketing and Advertising Costs\n\nThe Company expenses its marketing and advertising  costs  as  incurred  and  includes  them  within  selling,  general  and administrative expenses. The costs of tangible assets used in advertising campaigns are recorded as fixed assets or deferred advertising costs and amortized as advertising costs over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the advertising campaign. The  Company  has  several  long-term  sponsorship  arrangements.  Payments  related  to  these  arrangements  are  deferred  and expensed over the term of the arrangement. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $74 million, $66 million and $73 million, respectively.\n\n## Reorganization Costs\n\nReorganization  costs  include  costs  incurred  by  the  Company  related  to  the  Transformation  Plan  implementation  and primarily reflect severance and contract modifications. There were no reorganization costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Reorganization costs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $23 million and $90 million, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business combination. In addition, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nIn recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information  available.  Estimates  are  used  for  such  items  as  plant  depreciable  lives,  tax  provisions,  uncollectible  accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs, the valuation of energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of impaired  assets.  As  better  information  becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  are  determinable,  the  recorded  estimates  are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Adopted in 2020\n\nASU 2020-09 - In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-09, Debt (Topic 470) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10762 ,  or ASU 2020-09, to reflect the SEC's amended disclosure rules for guaranteed debt securities  offerings.  The  final  rule  amends  the  disclosure  requirements  in  SEC  Regulation  S-X,  Rule  3-10,  which  require entities  to  separately  present  financial  statements  for  subsidiary  issuers  and  guarantors  of  registered  debt  securities  unless certain  exceptions  are  met.  The  amended  rule  allows  entities  to  provide  summarized  financial  information  of  the  parent company  and  its  issuers  and  guarantors  on  a  combined  basis  either  in  a  note  to  the  financial  statements  or  as  part  of management's discussion and analysis. ASU 2020-09 is effective for filings on or after January 4, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the amendments effective December 31, 2020. As the amendments contemplate changes in disclosures  only,  it  did  not  have  an  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations,  cash  flows,  or  statement  of  financial position.\n\nASU  2018-17 -  In  October  2018,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2018-17, Consolidations  (Topic  810):  Targeted Improvements  to  Related  Party  Guidance  for  Variable  Interest  Entities ,  or  ASU  No.  2018-17,  in  response  to  stakeholders' observations  that  Topic  810, Consolidations ,  could  be  improved  thereby  improving  general  purpose  financial  reporting. Specifically, ASU No. 2018-17 requires application of the variable interest entity (VIE) guidance to private companies under common  control  and  consideration  of  indirect  interest  held  through  related  parties  under  common  control  for  determining whether  fees  paid  to  decision  makers  and  service  providers  are  variable  interests.  The  Company  adopted  the  amendments effective  January  1,  2020  using  the  retrospective  approach.  The  adoption  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's results of operations, cash flows, or statement of financial position.\n\nASU 2018-15 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is  a  Service  Contract ,  or  ASU  No.  2018-15.  The  amendments  in  ASU  No.  2018-15  align  the  requirements  for  capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangement that include an internal-use software license). The amendment  also  requires  the  customer  to  amortize  the  capitalized  implementation  costs  of  a  hosting  arrangement  that  is  a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement. The Company adopted the amendments effective January 1, 2020 using  the  prospective  approach.  The  adoption  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations,  cash flows, or statement of financial position.\n\nASU 2018-13 - In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirement for Fair value Measurement) , or ASU No. 2018-13. The amendments in ASU No. 2018-13 eliminate such disclosures as the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value  hierarchy  and  add  new  disclosure  requirements  for  Level  3  measurements.  The  Company  adopted  the  amendments",

As the amendments contemplates changes in disclosures only, it did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, or statement of financial position.\n\nASU 2016-13 - In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements, or  ASU No. 2016-13, which was further amended through various updates issued by the FASB thereafter. The guidance in ASU No. 2016-13 provides a new model for recognizing credit losses on  financial  assets  carried  at  amortized  cost  using  an  estimate  of  expected  credit  losses,  instead  of  the  \"incurred  loss\" methodology previously required for recognizing credit losses that delayed recognition until it was probable that a loss was incurred. The estimate of expected credit losses is to be based on consideration of past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions. The Company adopted the standard and its subsequent corresponding updates effective January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach. Results for the reporting periods after January 1, 2020 are presented under Topic 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company's adoption of Topic 326 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, or statement of financial position.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU 2020-06 - In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , or ASU No. 2020-06. The  guidance  in  ASU  2020-06  reduces  the  number  of  accounting  models  for  convertible  debt  instruments  and  convertible preferred  stock.  In  addition,  ASU  2020-06  improves  and  amends  the  related  earnings  per  share  guidance.  This  standard  is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is  currently  in  the  process  of  assessing  the  impact  of  this  guidance  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  disclosures related to earnings per share.\n\nASU 2019-12 In  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying  the Accounting for Income Taxes, or ASU No. 2019-12, to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The guidance in ASU 2019-12 amends the general principles in Topic 740 to eliminate certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investment, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. This ASU also includes guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, or statement of financial position.\n\n## Note 3 -Revenue Recognition\n\n## Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606,  using  the  modified  retrospective  method  applied  to  contracts  that  were  not  completed  as  of  the  adoption  date.  The Company  recognized  the  cumulative  effect  of  initially  applying  the  new  standard  as  a  credit  to  the  opening  balance  of accumulated  deficit,  resulting  in  a  decrease  of  $15  million.  The  adjustment  primarily  related  to  costs  incurred  to  obtain  a contract  with  customers  and  customer  incentives.  Following  the  adoption  of  the  new  standard,  the  Company's  revenue recognition of its contracts with customers remains materially consistent with its historical practice. The Company's policies with respect to its various revenue streams are detailed below. The Company generally applies the invoicing practical expedient to  recognize  revenue  for  the  revenue  streams  detailed  below,  except  in  circumstances  where  the  invoiced  amount  does  not represent the value transferred to the customer.\n\n## Retail Revenue\n\nGross revenues for energy sales and services to retail customers are recognized as the Company transfers the promised goods and services to the customer. For the majority of its electricity and natural gas contracts, the Company's performance obligation with the customer is satisfied over time and performance obligations for its electricity and natural gas products are recognized as the customer takes possession of the product. The Company also allocates the contract consideration to distinct performance  obligations  in  a  contract  for  which  the  timing  of  the  revenue  recognized  is  different.  Additionally,  customer discounts and incentives reduce the contract consideration and are recognized over the term of the contract.\n\nEnergy sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated. Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading provided by the independent system operators, utilities, or electric distribution companies. Volume estimates are based on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer",

        "page_content": "usage  by  class.  Unbilled  revenues  are  calculated  by  multiplying  these  volume  estimates  by  the  applicable  rate  by  customer class. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed.\n\nAs contracts for retail electricity and natural gas can be for multi-year periods, the Company has performance obligations under these contracts that have not yet been satisfied. These performance obligations have transaction prices that are both fixed and variable, and that vary based on the contract duration, customer type, inception date and other contract-specific factors. For the fixed price contracts, the amount of any unsatisfied performance obligations will vary based on customer usage, which will depend on factors such as weather and customer activity and therefore it is not practicable to estimate such amounts.\n\n## Energy Revenue\n\nBoth physical and financial transactions consist of revenues billed to a third party at either market or negotiated contract terms to optimize the financial performance of the Company's generating facilities. Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission  to  the  customer  over  time,  using  the  output  method  for  measuring  progress  of  satisfaction  of  performance obligations. Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is equal to the value to the customer of NRG's performance obligation completed to date. Financial transactions used to hedge the sale of electricity are recorded net within operating revenues in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 815.\n\n## Capacity Revenue\n\nThe  Company's  largest  sources  of  capacity  revenues  are  capacity  auctions  in  PJM,  ISO-NE  and  NYISO.  Capacity revenues  also  include  revenues  billed  to  a  third  party  at  either  market  or  negotiated  contract  terms  for  making  installed generation and demand response capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. Capacity revenues are recognized over time, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is  recognized  based  on  the  invoiced  amount  which  is  equal  to  the  value  to  the  customer  of  NRG's  performance  obligation completed to date.\n\n## Performance Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, estimated future fixed fee performance obligations are $668 million, $289 million, $47 million, $36 million and $20 million for fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. These performance obligations are for  cleared  auction  MWs  in  the  PJM,  ISO-NE,  NYISO  and  MISO  capacity  auctions  and  are  subject  to  penalties  for  non performance.\n\n## Renewable Energy Credits\n\nRenewable energy credits are usually sold through long-term contracts. Revenue from the sale of self-generated RECs is recognized when related energy is generated and simultaneously delivered even in cases where there is a certification lag as it has been deemed to be perfunctory.\n\nIn a bundled contract to sell energy, capacity and/or self-generated RECs, all performance obligations are deemed to be delivered at the same time and hence, timing of recognition of revenue for all performance obligations is the same and occurs over time. In such cases, it is often unnecessary to allocate transaction price to multiple performance obligations.\n\n## Sale of Emission Allowances\n\nThe Company records its inventory of emission allowances as part of intangible assets. From time to time, management may authorize the transfer of emission allowances in excess of expected usage from the Company's emission bank to intangible assets held-for-sale for trading purposes. The Company records the sale of emission allowances on a net basis within operating revenue in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.",

The change in deferred revenue balances during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to the timing difference of when consideration was received and when the performance obligation was transferred.\n\nThe Company's customer acquisition costs consist of broker fees, commission payments and other costs that represent incremental costs of obtaining the contract with customers for which the Company expects to recover. The Company amortizes these amounts over the estimated life of the customer contract. As a practical expedient, the Company expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less.\n\nWhen the Company receives consideration from the customer that is in excess of the amount due, such consideration is reclassified  to  deferred  revenue,  which  represents  a  contract  liability.  Generally,  the  Company  will  recognize  revenue  from contract liabilities in the next period as the Company satisfies its performance obligations.",

Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthens its integrated  model.  It  also  broadens  the  Company's  presence  in  the  Northeast  and  into  states  and  locales  where  it  did  not previously operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.\n\nThe  Company  paid  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $3.625  billion  in  cash,  subject  to  a  purchase  price  adjustment  of $77 million. The Company funded the purchase price using a combination of $715 million of cash on hand, $166 million from a draw on its Revolving Credit Facility (of which $107 million was used to fund acquisition costs and financing fees that are not included in the aggregate purchase price above) as well as approximately $2.9 billion in secured and unsecured corporate debt issued in December 2020. The Company also increased its collective collateral facilities by $3.4 billion as of the Acquisition Closing Date to meet the additional liquidity requirements related to the acquisition, as detailed in the following table:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                          | December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Revolving Credit Facility commitment increase (a)                                      | $  802              |\n| Revolving Credit Facility new tranche (a)                                              | 273                 |\n| Credit default swap facility                                                           | 150                 |\n| Revolving accounts receivable financing facility                                       | 750                 |\n| Repurchase facility                                                                    | 75                  |\n| Facility agreement in connection with the sale of pre-capitalized trust securities (a) | 874                 |\n| Bilateral letter of credit facilities                                                  | 475                 |\n| Total Increases to Liquidity and Collateral Facilities                                 | $  3,399            |\n\nFor further discussion see Note 13, Receivables Securitization and Repurchase Facility and Note 14, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases .\n\nAcquisition costs of $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 are included in selling, general and administrative costs in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\n\nThe  acquisition  will  be  recorded  as  a  business  combination  under  ASC  805,  with  identifiable  assets  acquired  and liabilities assumed provisionally recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The initial accounting for the business combination is not complete because the evaluation necessary to assess the fair value of certain net assets acquired and the  amount  of  goodwill  to  be  recognized  are  still  in  process.  The  provisional  amounts  are  subject  to  revision  until  the evaluations are completed to the extent that additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.",

The Company concluded that the divested business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as the disposition represents a strategic shift in the business in which NRG operates and held-for-sale criteria  as  of  December  31,  2018.  As  such,  all  prior  period  results  for  the  operations  of  the  South  Central  Portfolio  were reclassified  as  discontinued  operations  at  December  31,  2018.  In  connection  with  the  transaction,  NRG  also  entered  into  a transition  services  agreement  to  provide  certain  corporate  services  to  the  divested  business,  which  have  been  substantially completed in 2020.\n\nThe South Central Portfolio includes the 1,153 MW Cottonwood natural gas generating facility. Upon the closing of the sale  of  the  South  Central  Portfolio,  NRG  entered  into  a  lease  agreement  with  Cleco  to  leaseback  the  Cottonwood  facility through 2025. Due to its continuing involvement with the Cottonwood facility, NRG did not use held-for-sale or discontinued operations treatment in accounting for the Cottonwood facility.\n\nSummarized results of South Central discontinued operations were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                  | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                    | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Operating revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | $  31                     | $  410                    |\n| Operating costs and expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | (23)                      | (346)                     |\n| Other income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -                         | 2                         |\n| Gain from operations of discontinued components . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                              | 8                         | 66                        |\n| Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                        | 20                        | -                         |\n| Gain from discontinued operations, including disposal, net of tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                    | $  28                     | $  66                     |\n\n## Sale of Ownership in NRG Yield, Inc. and its Renewables Platform\n\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interests in NRG Yield, Inc. and its Renewables Platform to GIP for total cash consideration of $1.348 billion. The Company concluded that the divested businesses met the criteria for discontinued operations, as the dispositions represented a strategic shift in the business in which NRG operates. As such, all prior period results for the transaction were reclassified as discontinued operations. In connection with the transaction, NRG entered into a transition services agreement to provide certain corporate services to the divested businesses in 2018, which concluded in 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an adjustment to reduce the purchase price by $15 million in connection with the completion of the Patriot Wind project. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reduced the liability related to the indemnification of NRG Yield for any increase in property taxes for certain solar properties by $22 million due to updated estimates.\n\n## Carlsbad\n\nOn February 6, 2018, NRG entered into an agreement with NRG Yield and GIP to sell 100% of its membership interests in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC, which owns the Carlsbad project, for $385 million of cash consideration, excluding working capital adjustments. The primary condition to close the Carlsbad transaction was the completion of the sale of NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform. At the time of the sale of NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform in August 2018, the Company concluded that the Carlsbad project met the criteria for discontinued operations and accordingly, all current and prior period results for Carlsbad were reclassified as discontinued operations. The transaction closed on February 27, 2019. Carlsbad will continue  to  have  a  ground  lease  and  easement  agreement  with  NRG  with  an  initial  term  ending  in  2039  and  two  ten-year extensions. As a result of the transaction, additional commitments related to the project totaled $23 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.",

As a result of the bankruptcy filings, NRG concluded that it no longer controlled GenOn as it was subject to the control of the Bankruptcy Court; and, accordingly, NRG deconsolidated GenOn and its subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes as of such date.\n\nBy eliminating a large portion of its operations in the PJM market with the deconsolidation of GenOn, NRG concluded that  GenOn  met  the  criteria  for  discontinued  operations,  as  this  represented  a  strategic  shift  in  the  business  in  which  NRG operated. As such, all prior period results for GenOn were reclassified in 2017 as discontinued operations.\n\nSummarized results of discontinued operations were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                             | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                               | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Interest income - affiliate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | $  -                      | $  3                      |\n| Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                  | -                         | 3                         |\n| Settlement consideration, insurance and services credit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                             | -                         | 63                        |\n| Pension and post-retirement liability assumption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                          | -                         | 21                        |\n| Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (3)                       | (53)                      |\n| (Loss)/income on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                        | (3)                       | 31                        |\n| (Loss)/income from discontinued operations, net of tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                    | $  (3)                    | $  34                     |\n\n## GenOn Settlement and Plan Confirmation\n\nEffective  July  16,  2018,  NRG  and  GenOn  consummated  the  GenOn  Settlement  whereby  the  Company  paid  GenOn approximately $125 million, which included (i) the settlement consideration of $261 million, (ii) the transition services credit of $28 million and (iii) the return of $15 million of collateral posted to NRG; offset by the (i) $151 million in borrowings under the intercompany secured revolving credit facility, (ii) related accrued interest and fees of $12 million, (iii) remaining payments due under the transition services agreement of $10 million, (iv) $4 million reduction of the settlement payment related to NRG assigning to GenOn approximately $8 million of historical claims against REMA and (v) certain other balances due to NRG totaling $2 million.",

        "page_content": "GenOn's plan of reorganization was confirmed on December 14, 2018. Pursuant to the confirmed plan, NRG retained the pension liability for GenOn employees for service provided prior to the completion of the reorganization. NRG also retained the liability  for  GenOn's  post-employment  and  retiree  health  and  welfare  benefits.  As  a  result  of  GenOn's  emergence  from bankruptcy, NRG took a deduction for GenOn tax losses of $9.5 billion, including a worthless stock deduction.\n\nOther than those obligations which survive or are independent of the releases described herein, the GenOn Settlement and the GenOn Chapter 11 plan provide NRG releases from GenOn and each of its debtor and non-debtor subsidiaries.\n\n## REMA Plan of Reorganization\n\nOn October 16, 2018, REMA and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for chapter 11 relief and a prepackaged plan of reorganization  in  the  United  States  Bankruptcy  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  Texas.  The  REMA  debtors'  plan  of reorganization has been formally accepted by REMA's voting creditors and is consistent with the releases NRG received under the GenOn Settlement and the GenOn plan.\n\n## GenMA Settlement\n\nThe Bankruptcy Court order confirming the plan of reorganization also approved the settlement terms agreed to among the GenOn Entities, NRG, the Consenting Holders, GenOn Mid-Atlantic, and certain of GenOn Mid-Atlantic's stakeholders, or the  GenMA Settlement, and directed the settlement parties to cooperate in good faith to negotiate definitive documentation consistent with the GenMA Settlement term sheet in order to pursue consummation of the GenMA Settlement. The definitive documentation  effectuating  the  GenMA  Settlement  was  finalized  and  effective  as  of  April  27,  2018.  Certain  terms  of  the compromise with respect to NRG and GenOn Mid-Atlantic are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Settlement of all pending litigation and objections to the Plan (including with respect to releases and feasibility);\n- \u00b7 NRG provided $38 million in letters of credit as new qualifying credit support to GenOn Mid-Atlantic; such letters of credit were never drawn and were returned and canceled on December 17, 2019 and\n- \u00b7 NRG paid approximately $6 million as reimbursement of professional fees incurred by certain of GenOn MidAtlantic's stakeholders in connection with the GenMA Settlement.\n\n## Dispositions\n\nOn February 28, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight  Capital  Partners,  to  sell  approximately  4,850  MWs  of  fossil  generating  assets  from  its  East  and  West  regions  of operations for total proceeds of $760 million, subject to standard purchase price adjustments and certain other indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG is entering into a tolling agreement for its 866 MW Arthur Kill plant in New York City through April  2025.  The  transaction  is  expected  to  close  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  and  is  subject  to  various  closing  conditions, approvals and consents, including FERC, NYSPSC, and antitrust review under Hart-Scott-Rodino.\n\nOn November 19, 2020, the Company entered an agreement to sell its 35% ownership in Agua Caliente to Clearway Energy for $202 million. The sale of the solar project closed on February 3, 2021.\n\nIn  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  the  Company  concluded  its  Home  Solar  business  was  held  for  sale  and  recorded  an impairment loss of $29 million, as further discussed in Note 11, Asset  Impairments .  On  November 13, 2020, the Company completed the sale of the Home Solar business for cash proceeds of $66 million, resulting in a $2 million loss on the sale. In connection  with  the  sale,  the  Company  extinguished  debt  of    $27  million  and  recognized  a  $5  million  loss  on  the extinguishment.\n\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company completed the sale of 100% of its ownership interests in BETM to Diamond Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC for $71 million, net of working capital adjustments, which resulted in a gain of $15 million on the sale. The sale also resulted in the release and return of approximately $119 million of letters of credit, $32 million of parent guarantees, and $4 million of net cash collateral to NRG.\n\nOn June 29, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Canal 3 to Stonepeak Kestrel for cash proceeds of approximately $16 million and recorded a gain of $17 million. Prior to the sale, Canal 3 entered into a financing arrangement and received cash proceeds of $167 million, of which $151 million was distributed to the Company. The related debt was non-recourse to NRG and was transferred to Stonepeak Kestrel in connection with the sale of Canal 3. The Company entered into a project management agreement in 2018 to manage construction of Canal 3 and substantial completion was reached in June 2019.\n\nThe  Company  completed  other  asset  sales  for  cash  proceeds  of  $15  million  and  $22  million  during  the  years  ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.",

NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forward contracts.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset  or  liability  at  the  measurement  date.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include infrequently-traded,  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingled  investment  funds,  and  are  measured  using present value pricing models.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.",

        "page_content": "## Non-derivative fair value measurements\n\nNRG's investments in debt securities are classified as Level 3 and consist of non-traded debt instruments that were valued based on third-party market value assessments.\n\nThe trust  fund  investments  are  held  primarily  to  satisfy  NRG's  nuclear  decommissioning  obligations.  These  trust  fund investments hold debt and equity securities directly and equity securities indirectly through commingled funds. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1. In addition, U.S. government and federal agency obligations are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of corporate debt securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. Certain equity securities, classified as commingled funds, are analogous to mutual funds, are maintained by investment companies,  and  hold  certain  investments  in  accordance  with  a  stated  set  of  fund  objectives.  The  fair  value  of  the  equity securities classified as commingled funds are based on net asset values per fund share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying equity securities. However, because the shares in the commingled funds are not publicly quoted, not traded in an active market and are subject to certain restrictions regarding their purchase and sale, the commingled funds are measured using net asset value practical expedient. See also Note 7, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.\n\n## Derivative fair value measurements\n\nA  portion  of  the  Company's  contracts  are  exchange-traded  contracts  with  readily  available  quoted  market  prices.  A majority  of  NRG's  contracts  are  non-exchange-traded  contracts  valued  using  prices  provided  by  external  sources,  primarily price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter and on-line exchanges. For the majority of NRG markets, the Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To the extent that NRG receives multiple quotes, the Company's prices reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices obtained from all sources that NRG believes provide the most liquid market for the commodity. If the Company receives one quote, then the mid-point of the bid-ask spread for that quote is used. The terms for which such price information is available vary by commodity, region and product. A significant portion of the fair value of the Company's  derivative  portfolio  is  based  on  price  quotes  from  brokers  in  active  markets  who  regularly  facilitate  those transactions and the Company believes such price quotes are executable. The Company does not use third party sources that derive price based on proprietary models or market surveys. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable  market  data  with  similar  characteristics.  Contracts  valued  with  prices  provided  by  models  and  other  valuation techniques make up 17% of derivative assets and 18% of derivative liabilities. The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit risk, which for interest rate swaps is calculated utilizing the bilateral method based on published default probabilities. For commodities, to the extent that NRG's net exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty's default swap rate. If the exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses NRG's default swap rate. For interest rate swaps and commodities, the credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume NRG's liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for NRG's assets. As of December 31, 2020 the credit reserve resulted in a $2 million increase primarily within cost of operations. As of December 31, 2019 the credit reserve did not result in a significant change in fair value in operations revenue and cost of operations.\n\nThe fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2020, and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and overthe-counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations could be material.\n\nNRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial power executed in illiquid markets as well as  financial  transmission  rights,  or  FTRs.  The  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  in  developing  fair  value  include  illiquid power location pricing which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value.",

ASC 815, entities may choose to offset cash collateral posted or received against the fair value of derivative positions executed with the same counterparties under the same master netting agreements. The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $50 million of cash collateral posted and $19 million of cash collateral received on its balance sheet.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nIn addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation  measures  such  as  margin,  collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements  that  allow  for  the  netting  of  positive  and  negative  exposures  of  various  contracts  associated  with  a  single counterparty.  Risks  surrounding  counterparty  performance  and  credit  could  ultimately  impact  the  amount  and  timing  of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.",

        "page_content": "## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  counterparty  credit  exposure,  excluding  credit  exposure  from  RTOs,  ISOs,  and  registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $210 million and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $14 million, resulting in a net exposure of $204 million. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 54% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2022. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate. The following  tables  highlight  net  counterparty  credit  exposure  by  industry  sector  and  by  counterparty  credit  quality.  Net counterparty  credit  exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with  counterparties  where  netting  is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                | Net Exposure  (% of Total)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                      | 96 %                         |\n| Financial institutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 4                            |\n| Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                        |\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Investment grade . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 59 %                                 |\n| Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 41                                   |\n| Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n\nThe  Company  currently  has  $47  million  exposure  to  two  wholesale  counterparties  in  excess  of  10%  of  the  total  net exposure discussed above as of December 31, 2020. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. Given the credit quality, diversification and term of the exposure in the portfolio, NRG does not anticipate a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations from nonperformance by any of NRG's counterparties.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and includes credit  policies  that,  under  certain  circumstances,  require  that  losses  arising  from  the  default  of  one  member  on  spot  market transactions  be  shared  by  the  remaining  participants.  As  a  result,  the  counterparty  credit  risk  to  these  markets  is  limited  to NRG's share of overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE  and  NYMEX.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, primarily solar PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market  and  extrapolation  of  observable  market  data  with  similar  characteristics.  Based  on  these  valuation  techniques,  as  of December 31, 2020, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $645 million for the next five years.",

        "page_content": "## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  retail  credit  risk  through  the  Company's  retail  electricity  providers,  which  serve  C&I customers and the Mass market. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses  may  result  from  both  nonpayment  of  customer  accounts  receivable  and  the  loss  of  in-the-money  forward  value.  The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to C&I and Mass customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. The Company is also subject to risk with respect to its residential solar customers. The Company's provision for credit losses was $108 million, $95 million, and $85 million for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Current economic conditions may affect the Company's customers' ability to pay bills in a timely manner, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses.\n\n## Note 6 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. The Company may elect to designate  certain  derivatives  as  cash  flow  hedges,  if  certain  conditions  are  met,  and  defer  the  change  in  fair  value  of  the derivatives to accumulated OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Certain derivative instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, and interest rate swaps.\n\nAs the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing of its generation assets and retail operations, some of NRG's  commercial  activities  qualify  for  NPNS  accounting.  Most  of  the  retail  load  contracts  either  qualify  for  the  NPNS exception or fail to meet the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the retail supply and fuels supply contracts are recorded under mark-to-market accounting. All of NRG's hedging and trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy.\n\n## Energy-Related Commodities\n\nTo  manage  the  commodity  price  risk  associated  with  the  Company's  competitive  supply  activities  and  the  price  risk associated  with  wholesale  power  sales  from  the  Company's  electric  generation  facilities  and  retail  power  sales  from  NRG's retail operations, NRG enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative hedging instruments, utilizing the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Forward contracts, which commit NRG to purchase or sell energy commodities or purchase fuels in the future;\n- \u00b7 Futures contracts, which are exchange-traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument;\n- \u00b7 Swap agreements, which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual, or notional, quantity;\n- \u00b7 Option contracts, which convey to the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell a commodity;\n- \u00b7 Extendable swaps, which include a combination of swaps and options executed simultaneously for different periods. This combination of instruments allows NRG to sell out-year volatility through call options in exchange for natural gas swaps with fixed prices in excess of the market price for natural gas at that time. The above-market swap combined with its later-year call option are priced in aggregate at market at the trade's inception; and\n- \u00b7 Weather derivative products used to mitigate a portion of lost revenue due to weather.\n\nThe objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated as hedges include:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated power purchases for the Company's retail sales;\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales that provides an acceptable return on the Company's electric generation operations; and\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of the Company's power plants.",

In order to manage the  Company's  interest  rate  risk,  NRG  entered  into  interest  rate  swap  agreements.  As  of  December  31,  2019,  NRG  had  no interest rate derivative instruments as a result of the early termination of such contracts in connection with the repayment of the 2023 Term Loan Facility during the second quarter of 2019.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, NRG entered into $1.6 billion of interest rate hedges associated with anticipated certain financing needs. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate hedges were settled in connection with the issuance of fixed rate debt, resulting in a gain of $11 million that was recorded as a reduction to interest expense.\n\n## Volumetric Underlying Derivative Transactions\n\nThe following table summarizes the net notional volume buy/(sell) of NRG's open derivative transactions broken out by commodity, excluding those derivatives  that  qualified  for  the  NPNS  exception  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  Option contracts are reflected using delta volume. Delta volume equals the notional volume of an option adjusted for the probability that the option will be in-the-money at its expiration date.\n\n| (In millions)                  |                                                                             | Total Volume      | Total Volume      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Commodity                      | Units                                                                       | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2019 |\n| Emissions                      | Short Ton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 1                 | 3                 |\n| Renewables Energy Certificates | Certificates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 5                 | 1                 |\n| Coal                           | Short Ton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 2                 | 10                |\n| Natural Gas                    | MMBtu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | (286)             | (181)             |\n| Power                          | MWh . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 57                | 38                |\n| Capacity                       | MW/Day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | (1)               | (1)               |",

The roll-off amounts were offset by realized gains or losses at the settled prices and are reflected in revenue or cost of operations during the same period.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the $68 million loss from open economic hedge positions was primarily the result of  a  decrease  in  the  value  of  forward  positions  as  a  result  of  decreases  in  ERCOT  power  prices  and  heat  rate  contraction, partially offset by an increase in value of forward positions as a result of decreases in New York capacity prices.\n\nThe gains from open economic hedge positions of $42 million and $97 million  for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were primarily the result of an increase in the value of forward purchases of ERCOT heat rate contracts due to ERCOT heat rate expansion.\n\n## Credit Risk Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of the Company's hedging agreements contain provisions that require the Company to post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in credit quality, generally termed \"adequate assurance\" under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a downgrade in the Company's credit rating. The collateral required for contracts that have adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as of December 31, 2020 was $26 million. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately $35 million as of December 31, 2020. If called for  by  the  counterparty,  $1  million  of  additional  collateral  would  be  required  for  all  contracts  with  credit  rating  contingent features as of December 31, 2020.\n\nSee Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for discussion regarding concentration of credit risk.",

        "page_content": "## Note 7 Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund\n\nNRG's  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Trust  Fund  assets,  which  are  for  the  decommissioning  of  STP,  are  comprised  of securities classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value based on actively quoted market prices. Although NRG is responsible  for  managing  the  decommissioning  of  its  44%  interest  in  STP,  the  predecessor  utilities  that  owned  STP  are authorized by the PUCT to collect decommissioning funds from their ratepayers to cover decommissioning costs on behalf of NRG. NRC requirements determine the decommissioning cost estimate which is the minimum required level of funding. In the event  that  funds  from  the  ratepayers  that  accumulate  in  the  nuclear  decommissioning  trust  are  ultimately  determined  to  be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the utilities will be required to collect through rates charged to rate payers all additional amounts, with no obligation from NRG, provided that NRG has complied with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts. Following completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, any excess will be refunded to the respective ratepayers of the utilities.\n\nNRG accounts for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations , or ASC 980, because the Company's nuclear decommissioning activities are subject to approval by the PUCT, with regulated rates that are  designed  to  recover  all  decommissioning  costs  and  that  can  be  charged  to  and  collected  from  the  ratepayers  per  PUCT mandate. Since the Company is in compliance with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts and the cost of  decommissioning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Texas  ratepayers,  not  NRG,  all  realized  and  unrealized  gains  or  losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) related to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust liability and are not included in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, consistent with regulatory treatment.\n\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and unrealized gains and losses for the securities held in the trust funds, as well as information about the contractual maturities of those securities.\n\n|                                                                                           | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020                 | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019   | As of December 31, 2019                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions, except otherwise noted)                                                     | Fair Value                | Unrealized Gains          | Unrealized Losses         | Weighted- average maturities (in years) | Fair Value                | Unrealized Gains          | Unrealized Losses         | Weighted- average maturities (in years) |\n| Cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . .                                           | $  23                     | $  -                      | $  -                      | -                                       | $  17                     | $  -                      | $  -                      | -                                       |\n| U.S. government and federal agency  obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 70                        | 6                         | -                         | 10                                      | 68                        | 4                         | -                         | 11                                      |\n| Federal agency mortgage-backed  securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 89                        | 4                         | -                         | 24                                      | 100                       | 3                         | -                         | 24                                      |\n| Commercial mortgage-backed securities                                                     | 36                        | 2                         | -                         | 27                                      | 29                        | 1                         | 1                         | 24                                      |\n| Corporate debt securities . . . . . . . . . . . .                                         | 144                       | 13                        | -                         | 12                                      | 109                       | 6                         | -                         | 11                                      |\n| Equity securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                   | 521                       | 372                       | -                         | -                                       | 466                       | 324                       | -                         | -                                       |\n| Foreign government fixed income  securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 7                         | 1                         | -                         | 10                                      | 5                         | -                         | -                         | 10                                      |\n| Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                             | $  890                    | $  398                    | $  -                      |                                         | $  794                    | $  338                    | $  1                      |                                         |\n\nThe following table summarizes proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities and the related realized gains and losses from these sales.

Depreciation expense of property, plant and equipment recorded during the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $295 million, $271 million and $356 million, respectively.\n\n## Note 10 -Leases\n\nThe  Company  leases  generating  facilities,  land,  office  and  equipment,  railcars,  and  storefront  space  at  retail  stores. Operating leases with an initial term greater than twelve months are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company made an accounting policy election for all asset classes not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for its short-term leases, which are leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less. The Company recognizes lease expense for all operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the future, should another systematic basis become more representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects to consume the remaining economic benefit of the right-of-use asset, the Company will use that basis for lease expense.\n\nThe Company considers a contract to be or to contain a lease when both of the following conditions apply: 1) an asset is either explicitly or implicitly identified in the contract and 2) the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. The Company has the right to control the use of the identified asset when the Company has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use.\n\nLease payments are typically fixed and payable on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. Lease payments under certain agreements may escalate over the lease term either by a fixed percentage or a fixed dollar amount. Certain leases may provide for variable lease payments in the form of payments based on usage, a percentage of sales from the location under lease, or index-based (e.g., the U.S. Consumer Price Index) adjustments to lease payments. The Company has no leases which contain residual value guarantees provided by the Company as a lessee.\n\nThe Company's leases may grant the Company an option to renew a lease for an additional term(s) or to terminate the lease after a certain period. As part of its transition from the guidance contained in ASC 840 to the updated guidance in ASC 842, the Company elected not to use the practical expedient of using hindsight to determine the lease term and in assessing impairment of the right-of-use assets.",

        "page_content": "As permitted by ASC 842, the Company made an accounting policy election for all asset classes not to recognize rightof-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for its short-term leases, which are leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less. For the initial measurement of lease liabilities, the discount rate that the Company uses is either the rate implicit in the lease, if known, or its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term an amount equal to the payments for the lease.\n\nIn transition to ASC 842, the Company elected to apply the effective date transition method as of the January 1, 2019 adoption  date.  In  accordance  with  this  method,  the  Company's  reporting  for  comparative  periods  prior  to  January  1,  2019 presented in the financial statements continues to be in conformity with the guidance in ASC 840. The Company elected the following practical expedients, which allow entities to:\n\n- \u00b7 Not reassess whether any contracts that existed prior to the January 1, 2019 implementation date are or contain leases;\n- \u00b7 Not reassess the lease classification for any leases that commenced prior to the January 1, 2019 implementation date, meaning that all commenced capital leases under ASC 840 will be classified as finance leases under ASC 842 and all commenced operating leases under ASC 840 will be classified as operating leases under ASC 842;\n- \u00b7 Not reassess initial direct costs for any leases;\n- \u00b7 Not reassess whether existing land easements, which were not previously accounted as leases under ASC 840, are or contain leases; and\n- \u00b7 Not separate lease and non-lease components for all asset classes, except office space leases and generation facilities leases.\n\nAs described in Note 4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions ,  upon  the  close  of  the  South  Central Portfolio sale in 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to leaseback the Cottonwood facility through May 2025. The lease  was  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  ASC  842-40, Sale  and  Leaseback  Transactions ,  as  an  operating  lease  and accordingly, a right-of-use asset and lease liability were established on the lease commencement date and will be amortized through the end of the lease.\n\n## Lease Cost:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                         | For the Year Ended  December 31, 2020   | For the Year Ended  December 31, 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Finance lease cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | $  3                                    | $  -                                    |\n| Operating lease cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 100                                     | 109                                     |\n| Short-term lease cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 3                                       | 3                                       |\n| Variable lease cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 6                                       | 6                                       |\n| Sublease income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | (17)                                    | (17)                                    |\n| Total lease cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  95                                   | $  101                                  |\n\n## Other information:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                    | For the Year Ended  December 31, 2020   | For the Year Ended  December 31, 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:                                          |                                         |                                         |\n| Operating cash flows from operating leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  101                                  | $  104                                  |\n| Financing cash flows from finance leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 1                                       | -                                       |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | 5                                       | -                                       |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . .             | 4                                       | 215                                     |",

The Cottonwood facility had estimated cash flows that were lower than its carrying amount and the assets were considered impaired. The fair value of the assets was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for the facility. The income approach utilized estimates of after-tax cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and included key inputs such as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\n\nThe Cottonwood facility is being leased through 2025 and the Company recognized an impairment loss of $32 million in 2020 in the West/Other segment associated with the Company's long-term services agreement and related lease payments, as the carrying amounts of the assets from the contract were higher than the estimated operating cash flow though the remaining lease period.\n\nThe Company also recorded the following impairments in 2020 based on specific triggering events that occurred:\n\nHome Solar  In  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  the  Company  concluded  its  Home  Solar  business  was  held  for  sale  and recorded an impairment loss of $29 million in the West/Other segment to adjust the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities to fair market value based on indicative sale prices.\n\nPetra Nova Parish Holdings During the first quarter of 2020, due to the decline in oil prices, NRG determined that the carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary. In determining the fair value, the Company utilized an income approach to estimate future project cash flows. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $18 million in the Texas segment, which included the anticipated  drawdown  of  the  $12  million  letter  of  credit  posted  in  September  2019  to  cover  certain  project  debt  reserve requirements.\n\nOther Impairments - For the year ended  December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $14 million of impairment losses related to intangible assets in the Texas segment.",

        "page_content": "## 2019 Impairment Losses\n\nPetra Nova Parish Holdings - During the third quarter of 2019, NRG contributed  $95 million in cash to Petra Nova and posted a $12 million letter of credit to cover certain project debt reserve requirements. The cash portion of the contribution was used by Petra Nova to prepay a significant portion of the project debt. As a result, the previously disclosed guarantee of up to $124 million  related  to  the  project  level  debt  provided  by  NRG  was  canceled  and  the  remaining  project  debt  became  nonrecourse to NRG. In relation to this contribution, the Company evaluated the project for impairment and determined that the carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary. In determining the fair value, the Company utilized an income approach and considered project specific assumptions for the estimated future project cash flows. The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss of $101 million.\n\nOther Impairments - For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded  $12 million of impairment losses primarily related to investments and intangibles.\n\n## 2018 Impairment Losses\n\nGuam -  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  the  Company  concluded  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  NRG Solar Guam, LLC, was held for sale after board approval and advanced negotiations to sell the business. Accordingly, the Company recorded the assets and liabilities at fair market value as of December 31, 2018 based on the contractual sale price, which resulted in an impairment loss of $12 million. On February 20, 2019, the Company completed the sale of Guam for cash consideration of approximately $8 million.\n\nKeystone and Conemaugh - On September 5, 2018, the Company sold its approximately  3.7% interests in the Keystone and  Conemaugh  generating  stations.  NRG  recorded  impairment  losses  of  $14  million  for  Keystone  and  $14  million  for Conemaugh to adjust the carrying amount of the assets to fair value based on the contractual sale price.\n\nDunkirk During the second quarter of 2018, NRG ceased its development of the project to add gas capability at the Dunkirk  generating  station.  The  project  was  put  on  hold  in  2015  pending  the  resolution  of  a  lawsuit  filed  by  Entergy Corporation against the NYPSC, which challenged the legality of its contract with Dunkirk. The lawsuit was later dropped and development continued, but the delay imposed a new requirement on Dunkirk to enter into the NYISO interconnection study process. The NYISO studies have concluded that extensive electric system upgrades would be necessary for the station to return to service. This would cause the Company to incur a material increase in cost and delay the project schedule that would render the  project  impractical.  Consequently,  the  Company  has  recorded  an  impairment  loss  of  $46  million,  reducing  the  carrying amount of the related assets to $0.\n\nOther Impairments - As of December 31, 2018, the Company recorded additional asset impairment losses of  $13 million and impairment losses on equity method investments of $15 million.\n\n## Note 12 Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\n## Goodwill\n\nNRG's  goodwill  balance  was  $579  million  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  goodwill consisted  of  $165  million  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  Midwest  Generation  and  $414  million  for  retail  operations acquisitions, including Stream Energy and XOOM, which were acquired in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nThe  Company's  intangible  assets  as  of  December  31,  2020,  primarily  reflect  intangible  assets  established  with  the acquisitions  of  various  companies,  including  Stream  Energy,  XOOM, other retail acquisitions,  and  Texas  Genco.  Intangible assets are comprised of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Emission Allowances - These intangibles primarily consist of SO2 emission allowances, including those established with the 2006 acquisition of Texas Genco, RGGI emission credits and California carbon allowances. These emission allowances are held-for-use and are amortized to cost of operations based on units of production.\n- \u00b7 In-market nuclear fuel contracts - These intangibles were established with the Texas Genco acquisition in 2006 and are amortized to cost of operations over expected volumes over the life of each contract.\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships -  These  intangibles  represent  the  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date  of  acquired  businesses' customer  base.  The  customer  relationships  are  amortized  to  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  based  on  the expected discounted future net cash flows by year.",

The  assets  of  NRG  Receivables  LLC  are  first available  to  satisfy  the  claims  of  the  Lenders  before  making  payments  on  the  subordinated  note  and  equity  issued  by  NRG Receivables LLC. The assets of NRG Receivables LLC are not available to the Company and its subsidiaries or creditors unless and until distributed by NRG Receivables LLC. Under the Receivables Facility, certain indirect subsidiaries of the Company sell  their  accounts  receivables to NRG Receivables LLC, subject to certain terms and conditions. In turn, NRG Receivables LLC grants a security interest in the purchased receivables to the Lenders as collateral for cash borrowings and issuances of letters of credit. Pursuant to the Performance Guaranty, the Company has guaranteed, for the benefit of NRG Receivables and the  lenders,  the  payment  and  performance  by  each  indirect  subsidiary  of  its  respective  obligations  under  the  Receivables Facility. The accounts receivables remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and any amounts funded by the Lenders to NRG Receivables LLC will be reflected as short-term borrowings. Cash flows from the Receivables Facility are reflected as financing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company will continue to service the accounts receivables sold in exchange for a servicing fee. The Receivables Facility is scheduled to expire on September 21, 2021, unless renewed by the mutual consent of the parties in accordance with its terms. Borrowings by NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility bear interest as defined under the Receivables Financing Agreement. The weighted average interest rate related to usage under the Securitization Facility as of December 31, 2020 was 0.537%. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $198 million in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.\n\n## Repurchase Facility\n\nOn September 22, 2020, the Company entered into an uncommitted repurchase facility ('Repurchase Facility') related to the  Receivables  Facility.  Under  the  Repurchase  Facility,  the  Company  can  borrow  up  to  $75  million,  collateralized  by  a",

The Repurchase Facility is scheduled to expire on September 22, 2021, unless renewed by the mutual consent of the parties in accordance with its terms.

Interest is payable on the Unsecured Notes on February 15  and  August  15  of  each  year  beginning  on  August  15,  2021  until  the  maturity  date  of  February  15,  2029  for  the  2029 Unsecured Notes and February 15, 2031 for the 2031 Unsecured Notes.\n\n## Issuance of 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes\n\nOn December 2, 2020, NRG issued $1.4 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes, consisting of $500 million 2.000% senior secured first lien notes due 2025 (the '2025 Secured Notes') and $900 million 2.450% senior secured first lien notes due 2027 (the '2027 Secured Notes' and, together with the 2025 Secured Notes, the '2025 and 2027 Senior  Secured  First  Lien  Notes'),  at  a  discount.  The  2027  Secured  Notes  were  issued  under  NRG's  Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which sets out certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to meet such sustainability targets will result in a 25 basis point increase to the interest rate payable on the 2027 Secured Notes from and including the interest period ending on June 2, 2026. The 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a first-priority basis by each of NRG's current and future subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under its credit agreement. The 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes will be secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under NRG's credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors. The collateral securing the 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes will be  released  if  the  Company  obtains  an  investment  grade  rating  from  two  out  of  the  three  rating  agencies,  subject  to  an obligation to reinstate the collateral if such rating agencies withdraw the Company's investment grade rating or downgrade its rating  below  investment  grade.  Interest  is  payable  on  the  2025  and  2027  Senior  Secured  First  Lien  Notes  on  June  2  and December 2 of each year beginning on June 2, 2021 until the maturity date of December 2, 2025 for the 2025 Secured Notes and until the maturity date of December 2, 2027 for the 2027 Secured Notes.\n\n## Issuance of 2029 Senior Notes\n\nOn May 14, 2019, NRG issued $733 million of aggregate principal amount at par of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2029, or the 2029 Senior Notes. The 2029 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NRG and are guaranteed by certain of  its  subsidiaries.  Interest  will  be  paid  semi-annually  beginning  on  December  15,  2019,  until  the  maturity  date  of  June  15, 2029. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes were utilized to redeem the Company's remaining 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024.\n\n## Issuance of 2024 and 2029 Senior Secured First Lien Notes\n\nOn May 28, 2019, NRG issued $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes, consisting of $600 million 2.75% senior secured first lien notes due 2024 and $500 million 4.45% senior secured first lien notes due 2029, or the Senior Secured First Lien Notes, at a discount. The Senior Secured First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a first-priority basis by each of NRG's current and future subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under its credit agreement. The Senior Secured First Lien Notes will be secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under NRG's credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and the  guarantors.

The proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  the  Senior  Secured  First  Lien  Notes,  together  with  cash  on  hand,  were  used  to  repay  the Company's 2023 Term Loan Facility.\n\n## 2019 Senior Note Redemptions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company redeemed $733 million of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024 and recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $29 million, which included the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs of $5 million.\n\n## 2048 Convertible Senior Notes\n\nThe  Convertible  Notes  are  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  ASC  470-20, Debt  with  Conversion  and  Other  Options . Under ASC 470-20, issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement,  are  required  to  separately  account  for  the  liability  (debt)  and  equity  (conversion  option)  components.  The Convertible  Notes  are  convertible,  under  certain  circumstances,  into  the  Company's  common  stock,  cash  or  a  combination thereof (at NRG's option) at a price of $46.24 per common share as of December 31, 2020, which is equivalent to an conversion rate of approximately 21.6242 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2019, the Convertible Notes were convertible at a price of $47.74 per common share, which is equivalent to an conversion rate of approximately 20.9479 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes. The carrying amounts of the liability components as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $503 million and $491 million, respectively, were calculated by estimating the fair value of similar liabilities without a conversion feature at inception and amortizing the debt discount using the effective interest rate over the life of the note.\n\n## Senior Notes Early Redemption\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, NRG had the following outstanding issuances of senior notes with an early redemption feature, or Senior Notes:\n\n- i. 7.250% senior notes, issued May 23, 2016 and due May 15, 2026, or the 2026 Senior Notes;\n- ii. 6.625% senior notes, issued August 2, 2016 and due January 15, 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes;\n- iii. 5.750% senior notes, issued December 7, 2017 and due January 15, 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes;\n- iv. 5.250% senior notes, issued May 24, 2019 and due June 15, 2029, or the 2029 Senior Notes;\n- v. 3.375% senior notes, issued December 2, 2020 and due February 15, 2029, or the 3.375% 2029 Senior Notes; and\n- vi. 3.625% senior notes, issued December 2, 2020 and Due February 15, 2031, or the 2031 Senior Notes.\n\nThe Company periodically enters into supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding entities under the Senior Notes as guarantors.\n\nThe  indentures  and  the  forms  of  notes  provide,  among  other  things,  that  the  Senior  Notes  will  be  senior  unsecured obligations of NRG. The indentures also provide for customary events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of principal  or  interest;  breach  of  other  agreements  in  the  indentures;  defaults  in  failure  to  pay  certain  other  indebtedness;  the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts of money against NRG and its subsidiaries; the failure of certain guarantees to be  enforceable;  and  certain  events  of  bankruptcy  or  insolvency.  Generally,  if  an  event  of  default  occurs,  the  Trustee  or  the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately. The terms of the indentures, among other things, limit NRG's ability and certain of its  subsidiaries'  ability  to  return  capital  to  stockholders,  grant  liens  on  assets  to  lenders  and  incur  additional  debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on the Senior Notes until their maturity dates.",

The Company recorded a loss  on  debt  extinguishment  of  $17  million,  which  included  the  write-off  of  previously  deferred  debt issuance  costs  of  $13  million.  As  a  result  of  the  repayment  of  the  outstanding  2023  Term  Loan  Facility,  the  Company terminated the related interest rate swap agreements, which were in-the-money, and received $25 million that was recorded as a reduction to interest expense.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility Modification\n\nOn  May  28,  2019,  the  Company  amended  its  existing  credit  agreement  to,  among  other  thing,  (i)  provide  for  a $184  million  increase  in  revolving  commitments,  resulting  in  aggregate  revolving  commitments  under  the  amended  credit agreement equal to $2.6 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date of the revolving loans and commitments under the amended credit agreement to May 28, 2024, (iii) provide for a release of the collateral securing the amended credit agreement if NRG obtains an investment grade rating form two out of the three rating agencies, subject to an obligation to reinstate the collateral if such rating agencies withdraw NRG's investment grade rating or downgrade NRG's rating below investment grade, (iv) reduce the applicable margins for borrowings under (a) ABR Revolving Loans from 1.25% to 0.75% and (b) Eurodollar Revolving Loans from 2.25% to 1.75%, (v) add a sustainability covenant and (vi) make certain other changes to the existing covenants.\n\nOn August 20, 2020, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the existing revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of $802 million, (ii) provide for a new tranche of revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of $273 million with a maturity date that is 30 months after the Acquisition Close Date. The maturity date of the new revolving tranche of commitments may, upon request by the Company, at the option of each applicable lender under the new tranche be extended by a further 12 months, but not beyond May 28, 2024, which is the maturity date of the existing and increased commitments. Other than with respect to the maturity date, the terms of all revolving commitments and loan made pursuant thereto are identical. The increase in the existing commitments, and the commitments with respect to the new tranche, are effective on August 20, 2020 but  only became available on the Acquisition Closing Date. For further discussion on the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy  see  Note  4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions .  Upon the Acquisition Closing Date, total revolving commitments available, subject to usage, under this amendment will be $3.7 billion.\n\nIn addition, the amendment includes changes to, among other things, (i) permit the borrowing of up to full amount of the revolving commitments in Canadian dollars, (ii) increase the swingline facility from $50 million to $100 million and provide a $10 million swingline facility in Canadian dollars, (iii) increase the credit facilities lien basket from the greater of $6 billion and 30% of total assets  to  the  greater  of  $10  billion  and  30%  of  total  assets,  (iv)  increase  the  credit  facilities  debt  basket  from $6 billion to $10 billion, (v) increase the basket for securitization indebtedness from $750 million to $1.7 billion, (vi) provide an additional indebtedness basket equal to $600 million for certain liquidity facilities, and (vii) make certain other changes to the existing covenants and other provisions.",

The  Dunkirk  Bonds  are  guaranteed  on  a  first-priority  basis  by  each  of NRG's current and future subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under its credit agreement. The Dunkirk Bonds are secured by  a  first  priority  security  interest  in  the  same  collateral  that  is  pledged  for  the  benefit  of  the  lenders  under  NRG's  credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors. The collateral securing the Dunkirk Bonds will, at the request of NRG, be released if NRG satisfies certain conditions, including receipt of an investment grade rating on its senior, unsecured debt securities from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to reversion if those rating agencies withdraw their investment grade rating of the Bonds or any of NRG's senior, unsecured debt securities or downgrade such rating below investment grade. The Dunkirk Bonds are subject to mandatory tender and purchase on April 3, 2023 and have a final maturity date of April 1, 2042.\n\nNRG used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem during 2020 the existing principal amount of outstanding Dunkirk Power LLC 5.875% tax exempt bonds due 2042.\n\n## Indian River Bonds\n\nOn December 17, 2020, NRG issued $57 million in aggregate principal amount of NRG Indian River 2020 1.25% taxexempt refinancing bonds due 2040 (the \"IR 2040 Bonds\") and $190 million aggregate principal amount of NRG Indian River Power 2020 1.25% tax-exempt refinancing bonds due 2045 (the \"IR 2045 Bonds\") (together the \"IR Bonds\"). The IR Bonds are guaranteed on a first-priority basis by each of NRG's current and future subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under its credit agreement. The IR Bonds are secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under NRG's credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and  the  guarantors.  The  collateral  securing  the  IR  Bonds  will,  at  the  request  of  NRG,  be  released  if  NRG  satisfies  certain conditions, including receipt of an investment grade rating on its senior, unsecured debt securities from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to reversion if those rating agencies withdraw their investment grade rating of the IR Bonds or any of NRG's  senior,  unsecured  debt  securities  or  downgrade  such  rating  below  investment  grade.  The  IR  Bonds  are  subject  to mandatory tender and purchase on October 1, 2025 and have final maturity dates of October 1, 2040 for the IR 2040 Bonds and October 1, 2045 for the IR 2045 Bonds.\n\nNRG used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem during 2020 the existing principal amounts of outstanding Indian River Power 6.000% tax exempt bonds due 2040 and Indian River Power LLC 5.375% tax exempt bonds due 2045.\n\n## Non-Recourse Debt\n\nThe following are descriptions of certain indebtedness of NRG's subsidiaries. All of NRG's non-recourse debt is secured by the assets in the respective project subsidiaries as further described below.\n\n## Credit Default Swap Facility\n\nOn January 4, 2019, the Company entered into an $80 million credit agreement to issue letters of credit, which is currently supporting the Cottonwood facility lease. Annual fees of 1.33% on the facility were paid quarterly in advance. On August 13, 2020, the agreement was amended permitting the Company to increase the size of the facility and fees on the facility were adjusted  to  reflect  the  costs  of  the  credit  default  swaps  that  serve  as  collateral  for  the  facility.  In  order  to  increase  the Company's collective collateral facilities in connection with the Direct Energy acquisition, NRG expanded the facility allowing for  the  issuance  of  an  additional  $150  million  of  letters  of  credit  as  of  December  31,  2020.  As  of  December  31,  2020, $229 million was issued under this facility.",

        "page_content": "## Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities\n\nIn December 2020 the Company entered into a series of Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities to allow for the issuance of up to $475 million of letters of credit. These facilities are uncommitted. As of December 31, 2020, $5 million was issued under these facilities.\n\n## Put Option Agreement for Senior Debt Issuance\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into a 3-year put option agreement with a Delaware trust formed by the Company upon completion of the sale of $900 million pre-capitalized trust securities redeemable November 15, 2023 (the 'P-Caps'). The Trust invested the proceeds from the sale of the P-Caps in a portfolio of principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities (the 'Eligible Treasury Assets'). Under the put option agreement, NRG has the right, from time to time, to issue  to  the  Trust  and  to  require  the  Trust  to  purchase  from  NRG,  on  one  or  more  occasions  (the  'Issuance  Right'),  up  to $900 million aggregate principal amount of NRG's 1.841% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2023 (the 'P-Caps Secured Notes') in exchange for all or a portion of the Eligible Treasury Assets corresponding to the portion of the Issuance Right. NRG will pay a semi-annual premium to the Trust at a rate of 1.65%.\n\nThe P-Caps are to be redeemed by the Trust on November 15, 2023 or earlier upon an early redemption of the P-Caps Secured Notes. Following any distribution of P-Caps Secured Notes to the holders of the P-Caps, NRG may similarly redeem such P-Caps Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption price described below, plus accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Any P-Caps Secured Notes outstanding and held by the Trust as a result of the exercise of the Issuance Right that remain outstanding will also mature on November 15, 2023.\n\nThe Issuance Right will be exercised automatically in full if (1) NRG fails to pay the facility fee when due or any amount due and owing under the trust expense reimbursement agreement or fails to purchase and pay for any Eligible Treasury Assets that are due and not paid on their payment date and such failure is not cured within 30 days, or (2) upon certain bankruptcy events of NRG.\n\nNRG will be required to mandatorily exercise the Issuance Right if (1) an Acquisition Triggering Event has occurred, (2) NRG's  consolidated  stockholders'  equity,  determined  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  but  excluding  accumulated  other comprehensive income (or loss), equity of non-controlling interests attributable thereto and treasury stock at cost, has fallen below $2.0 billion, which amount may be adjusted from time to time upon the occurrence of certain specified events, (3) an event of default under the P-Caps Secured Notes Indenture (as defined below) has occurred or would have occurred had the PCaps  Secured  Notes  been  outstanding,  (4)  NRG  breaches  its  covenant  to  maintain  sufficient  capacity  under  other  material agreements to permit the issuance of the P-Caps Secured Notes in full, (5) a Collateral Enforcement Event (as defined below) has  occurred,  (6)  a  change  of  control  triggering  event  has  occurred  in  respect  of  NRG  or  (7)  certain  events  relating  to  the Trust's status as an 'investment company' under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 'Investment Company Act'),  have  occurred.  Upon  the  occurrence  of  any  event  described  in  clause  (1),  (2),  (3),  (4)  or  (7)  of  this  paragraph,  the Issuance Right will be exercised in full, and upon the occurrence of any event described in clause (5) or (6) of this paragraph, the Issuance Right will be exercised with respect to the applicable portion of the available amount of P-Caps Secured Notes specified in the Facility Agreement.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  issuance  of  the  P-Caps,  on  December  2,  2020,  NRG  entered  into  a  facility  agreement  for  the issuance  of  letters  of  credit  (the  'LC  Agreement')  and  Deutsche  Bank  Trust  Company  Americas  as  collateral  agent  (the 'Collateral Agent') and administrative agent pursuant to which certain financial institutions (the 'LC Issuers') are permitted to join with commitments to provide letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $874 million to support the operations of NRG and its subsidiaries and minority investments, including to replace certain currently outstanding letters of credit and other credit support issued for the account of entities being acquired pursuant to the Acquisition. In addition, on December 2, 2020,  the  Trust  entered  into  a  pledge  and  control  agreement  (the  'Pledge  Agreement'),  among  NRG,  the  Trust  and  the Collateral Agent for the LC Issuers, under which the Trust agreed to grant a pledge over the Eligible Treasury Assets in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the LC Issuers. Pursuant to the LC Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent is entitled to withdraw Eligible Treasury Assets from the Trust's pledged account, following notice to NRG, in the event NRG has failed to reimburse amounts drawn under any letter of credit issued pursuant to the LC Agreement, and the LC Issuers have the right to instruct the Collateral Agent to enforce the pledge over the Eligible Treasury Assets upon the occurrence of any event of default under the LC Agreement (a 'Collateral Enforcement Event'). As of December 31, 2020 no letters of credit were issued under this agreement .\n\n## Agua Caliente Borrower 1\n\nOn January 22, 2019, the lenders of the Agua Borrower 1 notes notified Agua Caliente Borrower 1, a subsidiary of the Company, of certain defaults under the financing agreement as it relates to the bankruptcy filing made by PG&E on January 29, 2019. PG&E is the offtaker of the underlying contracts, which are material to the project. The financing was entered into along with  Agua  Caliente  Borrower  2,  LLC,  a  subsidiary  of  Clearway  Energy  Inc.,  which  is  joint  and  several  to  the  parties.  On",

These benefits are based on pay, service history and age at retirement. Most pension benefits are provided through taxqualified plans. NRG also provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees. Cost sharing provisions vary by the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nNRG maintains  two  separate  qualified  pension  plans,  the  NRG  Pension  Plan  for  Bargained  Employees  and  the  NRG Pension Plan. Participation in the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees depends upon whether an employee is covered by a bargaining agreement.\n\nNRG expects  to  contribute  $30  million  to  the  Company's  pension  plans  in  2021,  of  which  $14  million  relates  to  the GenOn plan.\n\n## NRG Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe annual net periodic benefit cost/(credit) related to NRG's pension and other postretirement benefit plans include the following components:\n\n|                                                                                                                | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                  | 2020                                       | 2019                                       | 2018                                       |\n| Service cost benefits earned . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  10                                      | $  10                                      | $  23                                      |\n| Interest cost on benefit obligation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 38                                         | 46                                         | 44                                         |\n| Expected return on plan assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | (61)                                       | (59)                                       | (62)                                       |\n| Amortization of unrecognized net loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 5                                          | 3                                          | -                                          |\n| Settlement/curtailment expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | -                                          | -                                          | 7                                          |\n| Net periodic benefit (credit)/cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  (8)                                     | $  -                                       | $  12                                      |",

The fair value of the common/collective trust investments is valued at fair value which is equal to the sum of the market value of all of the fund's underlying investments. Certain common/collective trust investments have readily determinable fair value as they publish daily net asset value, or NAV, per share and are categorized as Level 2. Certain other common/collective trust investments and partnerships/joint ventures use NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient for valuation, and thus have been removed from the fair value hierarchy table.\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit obligations:\n\n|                                                                               | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                               | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average Assumptions                                                  | 2020                 | 2019                 | 2020                          | 2019                          |\n| Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 2.56 %               | 3.26 %               | 2.54 %                        | 3.26 %                        |\n| Interest crediting rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 3.12 %               | -                    | 1.62 %                        | -                             |\n| Rate of compensation increase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .             | 3.00 %               | 3.00 %               | - %                           | - %                           |\n| Health care trend rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | -                    | -                    | 7.2% grading  to 4.5% in 2028 | 7.5% grading to  4.5% in 2028 |\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit expense:\n\n|                                                         | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                         | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average  Assumptions                           | 2020                 | 2019                 | 2018                 | 2020                          | 2019                          | 2018                          |\n| Discount rate . . . . . . . .                           | 3.26 %               | 4.38%/4.20%          | 3.71%/4.04%          | 3.26%                         | 4.37%                         | 3.71% /4.08%                  |\n| Interest crediting rate . .                             | 3.66 %               | -                    | -                    | 2.28 %                        | -                             | -                             |\n| Expected return on plan  assets . . . . . . . . . . . . | 5.93 %               | 6.35 %               | 6.17 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Rate of compensation  increase . . . . . . . . . . .    | 3.00 %               | 3.00 %               | 3.00 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Health care trend rate . .                              | -                    | -                    | -                    | 7.5% grading  to 4.5% in 2028 | 7.8% grading  to 4.5% in 2025 | 8.2% grading to  4.5% in 2025 |",

        "page_content": "NRG  uses  December  31  of  each  respective  year  as  the  measurement  date  for  the  Company's  pension  and  other postretirement benefit plans. The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG's defined benefit retirement plans as of December 31. The discount rate assumptions represent the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at December 31. The Company utilizes the Aon AA Above Median, or AA-AM, yield curve to select the appropriate discount rate assumption for each retirement plan. The AA-AM yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 6 months to 99 years. Each bond issue used to build this yield curve must be non-callable, and have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings.\n\nNRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize  the  long-term  return  of  plan  assets  for  a  prudent  level  of  risk.  Risk  tolerance  is  established  through  careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The Investment Committee reviews the asset  mix  periodically  and  as  the  plan  assets  increase  in  future  years,  the  Investment  Committee  may  examine  other  asset classes such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building block approach to determining the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.

STPNOC, which operates and maintains STP, provides its employees a defined benefit pension plan, as well as postretirement health and welfare benefits. Although NRG does not sponsor the STP plan, it reimburses STPNOC for 44% of the contributions made towards its retirement plan obligations.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, STPNOC announced that the defined benefit pension plan will be frozen for non-union employees on December 31, 2021, This resulted in the curtailment of benefits, thereby requiring a remeasurement, including an update to the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations. As a result, during 2019, NRG recognized a gain of $8 million related to the curtailment of benefits and an increase of $32 million to the pension liability was recorded to other comprehensive income. The Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, NRG reimbursed STPNOC $8 million and $24 million, respectively, for its contribution to the plans. In 2021, NRG expects to reimburse STPNOC $18 million for its contribution to the plan.\n\nThe Company has recognized the following in its statement of financial position, statement of operations and accumulated OCI related to its 44% interest in STP:\n\n|                                                                                                         | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                         | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| (In millions)                                                                                           | 2020                 | 2019                 | 2020                          | 2019                          |\n| Funded status - STPNOC benefit plans  . . . . . . . . . .                                               | $  (99)  $           | (77)  $              | (20)  $                       | (20)                          |\n| Net periodic benefit cost/(credit) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                      | 7                    | 9                    | (4)                           | (4)                           |\n| Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations  recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) . | 22                   | (13)                 | 5                             | 6                             |\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nNRG's employees are also eligible to participate in defined contribution 401(k) plans.\n\nThe Company's contributions to these plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                                             | Year Ended December 31,   |   Year Ended December 31, |   Year Ended December 31, |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                               | 2020                      |                      2019 |                      2018 |\n| Company contributions to defined contribution plans . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  22                     |                        22 |                        28 |\n\n## Note 17 Capital Structure\n\nFor the period from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2020, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized and 500,000,000 shares of common stock authorized.

The return of capital to shareholders is expected to be completed through the increased dividend supplemented by share repurchases. The long-term capital allocation policy targets an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in years subsequent to 2020. In 2021 NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.30 per share, representing an 8% increase. The Company's common stock dividends are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations.\n\nOn January 21, 2021, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.325 per share, or $1.30 per share on an annualized basis, payable on February 16, 2021, to stockholders of record as of February 1, 2021.\n\nEmployee  Stock  Purchase  Plan -  In  March  2019,  the  Company  reopened  participation  in  the  ESPP,  which  allows eligible  employees  to  elect  to  withhold  between  1%  and  10%  of  their  eligible  compensation  to  purchase  shares  of  NRG common stock at the lesser of 95% of its market value on the offering date or 95% of the fair market value on the exercise date. An offering date will occur each April 1 and October 1. An exercise date will occur each September 30 and March 31. The ESPP, that was suspended in 2018, allowed eligible employees to elect to withhold up to 10% of their eligible compensation to purchase shares of NRG common stock at the lesser of 85% of its fair market value on the offering date or 85% of the fair market value on the exercise date. An offering date occurred each January 1 and July 1. An exercise date occurred each June 30 and December 31. As of December 31, 2020, there remained 2,753,591 shares of treasury stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP.\n\nShare Repurchases - In 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase  $1.5 billion of its common stock.  The  Company  executed  $1.25  billion  of  these  share  repurchases  in  2018,  with  the  remaining  $0.25  billion completed in the first quarter of 2019. In 2019, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase an additional $1.25 billion of its common stock. The Company executed $1.194 billion of these share repurchases in 2019 and completed the remaining $56 million under the 2019 authorization by February 27, 2020. The remaining repurchases in 2020 were made under the long-term capital allocation policy discussed above.\n\nThe following table summarizes the shares repurchases made during the years 2018, 2019 and

Both projects have project financing with the U.S. DOE. On January 29, 2019, PG&E Corp. and primary operating subsidiary utility PG&E filed for Chapter 11 relief in the California Bankruptcy Court. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, Agua Caliente and the two Ivanpah units were issued notices of events of default under their respective loan agreements. On September 9, 2019, PG&E filed a plan of reorganization that would assume all power purchase agreements, including those held by Agua Caliente and the two Ivanpah units. The California Bankruptcy Court approved the PG&E plan and the Confirmation Order was entered on June 19, 2020. The plan went effective, and PG&E emerged from bankruptcy on July 1, 2020. In July 2020, the U.S. DOE agreed  to  waivers  of  the  bankruptcy-related  events  of  default  with  respect  to  the  Agua  Caliente  and  Ivanpah  projects. Subsequent  to  PG&E's  emergence  from  bankruptcy,  the  Agua  Caliente  and  the  Ivanpah  projects  were  allowed  to  resume distributions, and as of December 31, 2020, NRG received $50 million. In November 2020, Clearway Energy Inc. agreed to buy NRG's 35% interest in Agua Caliente. The transaction closed on February 3, 2021.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nNRG accounts for its interests in certain entities that are considered VIEs under ASC 810, Consolidation , for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary, under the equity method.\n\nThrough its consolidated subsidiary, NRG Solar Ivanpah LLC, NRG owns a 54.5% interest in Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC, or Ivanpah, the owner of three solar electric generating projects located in the Mojave Desert with a total capacity of 393 MW. NRG considers this investment a VIE under ASC 810 and NRG is not considered the primary beneficiary. The Company accounts for its interest under the equity method of accounting.\n\nThe Ivanpah solar electric generating projects were funded in large part by loans guaranteed by the U.S. DOE and equity from the projects' partners. During the first quarter of 2018, all interested parties sought a restructuring of Ivanpah's debt in order  to  avoid  a  potential  event  of  default  with  respect  to  the  loans  in  connection  with  several  recent  events.  Ensuing negotiations  culminated  in  a  settlement  during  the  second  quarter  of  2018  between  the  parties  which  resulted  in  certain transactions, including the release of reserves totaling $95 million to fund equity distributions to the partners, which reduced the equity  at  risk,  and  the  prepayment  of  certain  of  the  debt  balance  outstanding,  and  the  amendment  of  certain  of  Ivanpah's governing  documents.  The  equity  distributions  and  prepayment  of  debt  were  funded  by  the  agreed  upon  release  of  reserve funds. These events were considered to be a reconsideration event in accordance with ASC 810. As a result, NRG determined that it is not the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated Ivanpah. NRG recognized a loss of $22 million on the deconsolidation and subsequent recognition of Ivanpah as an equity method investment. The deconsolidation of Ivanpah reduced the Company's",

The power generation facility is managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the facility are funded by each of the participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is sourced from local mines in Queensland. NRG and the joint venture  participants  receive  their  respective  share  of  revenues  directly  from  the  off  takers  in  proportion  to  the  ownership interests in the joint venture. Power generated by the facility is primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter, with excess power sold to the Queensland Government-owned utility under long-term supply contracts. NRG's investment in Gladstone was $131 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Entities that are Consolidated\n\nThe Company has a controlling financial interest in certain entities which have been identified as VIEs under ASC 810. These arrangements are  related  to  the  Receivables  Facility,  as  further  described  in  Note  13, Receivables  Securitization  and Repurchase Facility, and  tax  equity  arrangements entered into with third-parties in order to finance the cost of solar energy systems under operating leases eligible for certain tax credits as further described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .

Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding. Diluted income per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic income per share, while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.\n\nDilutive effect for equity compensation and other equity instruments - The outstanding non-qualified stock options, nonvested restricted stock units, and market stock units and relative performance stock units are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic income per share. However, these instruments are included in the denominator for purposes of computing diluted income per share under the treasury stock method. The 2048 Convertible Senior Notes are convertible, under certain circumstances, into the Company's common stock, cash or combination thereof (at NRG's option). There is no dilutive effect for the 2048 Convertible Senior Notes due to the Company's expectation to settle the liability in cash.",

        "page_content": "During the year ended December 31, 2019, NRG released the majority of its valuation allowance against its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, resulting in a non-cash benefit to income tax expense of approximately $3.5 billion. In making the determination to release the majority of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019, the Company evaluated a number of factors, including its recent history of pre-tax earnings, utilization of $593 million of NOLs in 2019, as well as its forecasted future pre-tax earnings. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the majority of its future tax benefits are morelikely-than-not to be realized. Given the Company's current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Senate passed the CARES Act to provide emergency relief related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains federal income tax provisions which, among other things: (i) increases the amount of interest expense that businesses are allowed to deduct by increasing the adjusted taxable income limitation from 30% to 50% for tax years that begin  in  2019  and  2020;  (ii)  permits  businesses  to  carry  back  to  each  of  the  five  tax  years  NOLs  arising  from  tax  years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2020; and (iii) temporarily removes the 80% limitation on NOLs until tax years beginning after 2020. The CARES Act provisions did not have a material impact on the tax positions of the Company.\n\nThe following represented the domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes:\n\n|                                                                                                                 | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                   | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| U.S.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  749                    | $  771                    | $  468                    |\n| Foreign . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 12                        | 15                        | (1)                       |\n| Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  761                    | $  786                    | $  467                    |\n\nReconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to NRG's effective tax rate were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                             | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions, except effective income tax rate)                                                             | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Income from continuing operations before income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . .                               | $  761                    | $  786                    | $  467                    |\n| Tax at federal statutory tax rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | 160                       | 165                       | 98                        |\n| State taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 18                        | 13                        | 18                        |\n| Permanent differences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | 8                         | (9)                       | 7                         |\n| Changes in valuation allowance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 24                        | (3,492)                   | (106)                     |\n| Deferred impact of state tax rate changes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                     | 2                         | 12                        | -

The Company believes certain state net operating losses may not be realizable under the more-likely-than-not measurement and as such, a valuation allowance was recorded as of December 31, 2020 as discussed below.\n\nNOL carryforwards -  As  of December 31, 2020, the Company had tax-effected cumulative U.S. NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $2.1 billion and $351 million, respectively. The Company estimates it will need to generate future taxable income to fully realize the net federal deferred tax asset before the expiration of certain carryforwards commences in 2031. In addition, NRG has tax-effected cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $102 million with no expiration date.",

        "page_content": "Valuation allowance -  As of December 31, 2020, the Company's tax-effected valuation allowance was $266 million, consisting of state NOL carryforwards and foreign NOL carryforwards. The valuation allowance was recorded based on the assessment  of  cumulative  and  forecasted  pre-tax  book  earnings  and  the  future  reversal  of  existing  taxable  temporary differences.\n\n## Taxes Receivable and Payable\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, NRG recorded a current tax payable of $12 million that represents a tax liability due for state income taxes that is primarily comprised of Texas margin tax. NRG has a tax receivable of $1 million, comprised of refunds due from state income tax estimated payments and return filings.\n\n## Uncertain tax benefits\n\nNRG has identified uncertain tax benefits with after-tax value of $15 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, for which NRG has recorded a non-current tax liability of $18 million and $17 million, respectively. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company recognized expense of $1 million related to interest in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, NRG had cumulative interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax benefits of $3 million and $2 million, respectively.\n\nTax jurisdictions - NRG is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including operations located in Australia and Canada.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2017. With few exceptions, state and local income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2012.\n\nThe following table summarizes uncertain tax benefits activity:\n\n|                                                                                                                                   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                     | 2020                 | 2019                 |\n| Balance as of January 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  15                | $  26                |\n| Increase due to current year positions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 3                    | 2                    |\n| Settlements, payments and statute closure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | (3)                  | (13)                 |\n| Uncertain tax benefits as of December 31 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | $  15                | $  15                |\n\n## Note 22 Stock-Based Compensation\n\n## NRG Energy, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nOn April 27, 2017, the NRG LTIP was amended to increase the number of shares available for issuance by 3,000,000. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a total of 25,000,000 shares of NRG common stock were authorized for issuance under the NRG LTIP. There were 9,385,730 and 9,935,750 shares of common stock remaining available for grants under the NRG LTIP as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  respectively.  The  NRG  LTIP  is  subject  to  adjustments  in  the  event  of  reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, and a combination of shares, merger or similar change in NRG's structure or outstanding shares of common stock.\n\nUpon adoption of the amended NRG LTIP effective April 27, 2017, no shares of NRG common stock remain available for future issuance under the NRG GenOn LTIP.

DSUs granted under the Company's LTIPs are fully vested at the date of issuance. Fair  value  of  the  DSUs,  which  is  based  on  the  closing  price  of  NRG  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  is  recorded  as compensation expense in the period of grant.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's outstanding DSU awards and changes during the year:\n\n|                                                                                                                               | Units    | Weighted Average Grant  Date Fair Value per Unit   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                | 331,223  | $  23.98                                           |\n| Granted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 58,861   | 35.59                                              |\n| Converted to Common Stock . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | (47,378) | 26.87                                              |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                    | 342,706  | 25.37                                              |\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $13 million each year. The aggregate intrinsic values for DSUs converted to common stock for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $2 million, $2 million and $6 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of DSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $35.59, $34.84 and $33.43, respectively.\n\n## Performance Stock Units\n\nPSUs entitle the recipient to stock upon vesting. The amount of the award is subject to the Company's achievement of certain performance measures over the vesting period. PSUs include RPSUs and MSUs. As of December 31, 2020, non-vested PSUs consist primarily of RPSUs.\n\nRelative Performance Stock Units RPSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's Total Shareholder Return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the Company's current proxy peer group and the total returns of select indexes, or Peer Group. Each RPSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of NRG common stock to be paid (if any) as of the vesting date for each RPSU will depend on the Company's percentile rank within the Peer Group. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each RPSU is linearly interpolated for TSR performance between the following points: (i)  0%  if  ranked  below  the  25th  percentile;  (ii)  25%  if  ranked  at  the  25th percentile; (iii) 100% if ranked at the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if the Company's absolute TSR is less than negative 15%); and (iv) 200% if ranked at the 75th percentile or above. The value of the common stock on the date of grant is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant.\n\nMarket  Stock  Units  MSUs are restricted  grants  where  the  quantity  of  shares  increases  and  decreases  alongside  the Company's TSR. Each MSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each MSU is : (i) zero shares, if the TSR has decreased by more than 25% over the performance period, (ii) three-quarters of one share, if the TSR has decreased by 25% over the performance period; (iii) interpolated between threequarters of one share and one share, if the TSR has decreased less than 25% over the performance period; (iv) one share, if there is no change in TSR over the performance period; (v) interpolated between one share and two shares, if TSR increases less than 100% during the performance period; and (vi) two shares, if the TSR increases 100% over the performance period. The value of the common stock on the date of grant was based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant. The Company last granted MSUs during the year ended December 31, 2016. As of March 1, 2021 all MSUs were vested.",

No NQSOs were granted in 2020, 2019 or 2018. NRG recognized compensation costs for NQSOs over the requisite service period for the entire award. No compensation expense was recognized during 2020, 2019 or 2018 as it was fully recognized in prior years.

NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedges. To the extent  that  the  underlying  hedge  positions  for  a  counterparty  are  out-of-the-money  to  NRG,  the  counterparty  would  have  a claim under the first lien program. As of December 31, 2020, hedges under the first lien were in-the-money for NRG on a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\n## Nuclear Insurance\n\nSTP  maintains  required  insurance  coverage  for  liability  claims  arising  from  nuclear  incidents  pursuant  to  the  PriceAnderson Act. The current liability limit per incident is $13.8 billion, subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and  the  number  of  licensed  reactors.  An  inflation  adjustment  must  be  made  at  least  once  every  five  years  with  the  next adjustment expected to be effective no later than November 1, 2023. Under the Price-Anderson Act, owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are required to purchase primary insurance limits of $450 million for each operating site. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act requires an additional layer of protection through mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power  reactors  resulting  in  an  additional  $13.3  billion  in  funds  available  for  public  liability  claims.

        "page_content": "assessment per incident, per reactor, is approximately $138 million, taking into account a 5% adjustment for administrative fees,  payable  at  approximately  $21  million  per  year,  per  reactor.  NRG  would  be  responsible  for  44%  of  the  maximum assessment, or $9 million per year, per reactor, and a maximum of $61 million per incident, per reactor. In addition, the U.S. Congress  retains  the  ability  to  impose  additional  financial  requirements  on  the  nuclear  industry  to  pay  liability  claims  that exceed $13.8 billion for a single incident. The liabilities of the co-owners of STP with respect to the retrospective premium assessments for nuclear liability insurance are joint and several.\n\nSTP purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, or NEIL, and European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance, or EMANI, both of which are industry mutual insurance companies, of which STP is a member. STP has purchased $2.8 billion in limits for nuclear events and $1.0 billion in limits for non-nuclear events. The nuclear event limit remains the maximum available from NEIL. The upper $1.3 billion in nuclear events limits (excess of the first $1.5 billion in nuclear events limits) is a single limit blanket policy shared with two Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors, which have no affiliation with the Company. This shared limit is not subject to automatic reinstatement in the event of a loss. The NEIL primary policy covers both nuclear and non-nuclear property damage events, and a NEIL companion policy provides Accidental Outage coverage for the co-owners of STP's lost revenue following a property damage event, at a weekly indemnity limit of $3 million per unit up to a maximum of $274 million nuclear per unit and $184 million non-nuclear per unit, and is subject to an eight-week waiting period. NRG also purchases an Accidental Outage policy from NEIL, which provides protection for lost revenue due to an insurable event. This coverage allows for reimbursement up to $2 million per week per unit up to a maximum of $216 million nuclear and $144 million non-nuclear, and is subject to an eightweek waiting period. Accidental Outage coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. Under the terms of the NEIL and EMANI policies, member companies may be assessed up to ten and six times their annual premiums respectively if the NEIL or EMANI Board of Directors determines their surplus has been depleted due to the payment of property losses at any of the licensed reactors in a single policy year. NEIL and EMANI require that their members maintain an investment grade credit rating or ensure their annual retrospective obligation by providing a financial  guarantee,  letter  of  credit,  deposit  premium,  or  an  insurance  policy.  NRG  has  purchased  an  insurance  policy  from NEIL and EMANI to guarantee the Company's obligation; however note the NEIL aspect of this insurance will only respond to retrospective  premium  adjustments  assessed  within  twenty-four  months  after  the  policy  term,  whereas  NEIL's  Board  of Directors can make such an adjustment up to 6 years after the policy expires. All insurance coverage is subject to various sub limits and significant deductibles.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe Company's material legal proceedings are described below. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously. NRG records accruals for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. As  applicable,  the  Company  has  established  an  adequate  accrual  for  the  applicable  legal  matters,  including  regulatory  and environmental matters as further discussed in Note 25, Regulatory Matters , and Note 26, Environmental Matters . In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred. Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success. Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings  or  reasonably  estimate  the  scope  or  amount  of  any  associated  costs  and  potential  liabilities.  As  additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded accruals and that such difference could be material.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  proceedings  noted  below,  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  other  litigation  or  legal proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  management's  opinion,  the  disposition  of  these  ordinary  course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nWashington-St. Tammany and Claiborne Electric Cooperative v. LaGen On June 28, 2017, plaintiffs Washington-St. Tammany Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Claiborne Electric Cooperative, Inc. filed a lawsuit against LaGen in the United States District  Court  for  the  Middle  District  of  Louisiana.  The  plaintiffs  claim  breach  of  contract  against  LaGen  for  allegedly improperly charging the plaintiffs for costs related to the installation and maintenance of certain pollution control technology. Plaintiffs  sought  damages  for  the  alleged  improper  charges  and  a  declaration  as  to  which  charges  were  proper  under  the contract. In February 2020, the court dismissed this lawsuit without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On March 17, 2020, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge in Louisiana alleging  substantially  the  same  matters.  On  February  4,  2019,  NRG  sold  the  South  Central  Portfolio,  including  the  entities subject  to  this  litigation.  However,  NRG  has  agreed  to  indemnify  the  purchaser  for  certain  losses  suffered  in  connection therewith.",

        "page_content": "Sierra club et al. v. Midwest Generation LLC - In 2012, several environmental groups filed a complaint against Midwest Generation  with  the  Illinois  Pollution  Control  Board  (\"IPCB\")  alleging  violations  of  environmental  law  resulting  in groundwater contamination. In June 2019, the IPCB found that Midwest Generation violated the law because it had improperly handled coal ash at four facilities in Illinois and caused or allowed coal ash constituents to impact groundwater. On September 9, 2019, Midwest Generation filed a Motion to Reconsider numerous issues, which the court granted in part and denied in part on February 6, 2020. The IPCB will hold hearings to determine the appropriate relief. Midwest Generation has been working with the Illinois EPA to address the groundwater issues since 2010.\n\nXOOM Energy Litigation - XOOM has been a defendant in  two purported class action lawsuits in Maryland and New York. The plaintiffs generally claim that they did not receive the savings they were promised in their natural gas and electricity bills. In the Maryland lawsuit, the district court denied plaintiff's' bid to certify the case as a class action on August 18, 2020. The matter has been dismissed. In the New York case, XOOM filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted on September 21, 2018, later entering judgment in XOOM's favor on September 24, 2018. The plaintiffs in the New York case appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On July 26, 2019, the Second Circuit reversed the judgment of the district court and  remanded  to  the  district  court  with  instructions  that  plaintiffs  be  permitted  to  proceed  on  their  proposed  amended complaint. The New York case is in the discovery phase. This matter was known and accrued for at the time of the acquisition.\n\n## Note 25 Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. As such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at both the federal and state levels and in the regions in which NRG operates. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures, and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which NRG participates. These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that may impact NRG's wholesale and retail operations.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  regulatory  proceedings  noted  below,  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  parties  to  other  regulatory proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  or  have  other  regulatory  exposure.  In  management's  opinion,  the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nCalifornia  Station  Power  As  the  result  of  unfavorable  final  and  non-appealable  litigation,  the  Company  accrued  a liability associated with consumption of station power at the Company's Encina power plant facility in California after August 30, 2010. The Company has established an appropriate accrual pending potential regulatory action by SDG&E regarding the Company's Encina facility.\n\nSouth Central On August 4, 2016, NRG received a document hold notice from FERC regarding conduct in the MISO and PJM markets. FERC Office of Enforcement Staff investigated potential violations of MISO rules involving bidding for the Big Cajun 2 facility, as well as other aspects of NRG's operations in MISO. On August 18, 2020, FERC Office of Enforcement presented NRG with its preliminary findings. NRG responded to the preliminary findings on January 15, 2021. FERC has the authority to require disgorgement of profits and to impose penalties and NRG retains any liability following the sale of the South Central Portfolio.\n\nISO-NE On January 8, 2021, the Commission approved a settlement agreement the Company entered into to resolve FERC Enforcement Staff's investigation of offers submitted during the qualification period for the ISO-NE Forward Capacity Auction  in  2016.  The  settlement  was  approved  in  a  2-1  vote.  The  Commission  Chairman  dissented  on  the  basis  that  the investigation should have been terminated because the Company should not be penalized for reflecting a different expectation from that of the ISO-NE Internal Market Monitor in its forecast of future events submitted for independent review in the tariffprescribed bid review process. Under the settlement, the Company agreed to pay a civil penalty of $85 thousand and is subject to compliance monitoring.\n\n## Note 26 Environmental Matters\n\nNRG is subject  to  a  wide  range  of  environmental  laws  in  the  development,  construction,  ownership  and  operation  of power  plants.  These  laws  generally  require  that  governmental  permits  and  approvals  be  obtained  before  construction  and maintained  during  operation  of  power  plants.  The  electric  generation  industry  has  been  facing  increasingly  stringent requirements  regarding  air  quality,  GHG  emissions,  combustion  byproducts,  water  discharge  and  use,  and  threatened  and endangered species. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose additional restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  or  cash  flows.  The  Company  has  elected  to  use  a  $1 million disclosure threshold, as permitted, for environmental proceedings to which the government is a party.",

        "page_content": "## Air\n\nOn July 8, 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO2 emissions from the power sector. The ACE rule required states that have coal-fired EGUs to develop plans to seek heat rate improvements from coal-fired EGUs. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). Accordingly, we expect the EPA to promulgate a new rule to regulate GHG emissions from power plants.\n\n## Water\n\nEffluent Limitations Guidelines -  In  November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for  bottom  ash  transport  water;  and  (iii)  changing  several  deadlines.  The  Company  is  in  the  process  of  estimating  the environmental capital expenditures that will be required to comply. The capital expenditures required to comply will depend on elections regarding future operations of each coal-fired unit. NRG expects to make these elections for each unit in Q4 2021 at which time the EPA will be notified as required. Accordingly, we do not expect to provide estimates of ELG compliance costs until early 2022.\n\n## Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination\n\nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. In September 2017, the EPA agreed to reconsider the rule. On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the existing ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy ponds. In 2019 and 2020, the EPA proposed several changes to this rule. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Close Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B,\" which  further  amended  the  April  2015  Rule  to,  among  other  things,  provide  procedures  for  requesting  approval  to  operate existing  impoundments  with  an  alternative  liner.  The  Company  has  updated  its  estimates  of  required  environmental  capital expenditures.\n\n## Note 27 Cash Flow Information\n\nDetail of supplemental disclosures of cash flow and non-cash investing and financing information was:\n\n|                                                                                                           | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                             | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Interest paid, net of amount capitalized . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | $  340                    | $  372                    | $  436                    |\n| Income taxes paid, net of refunds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 24                        | 8                         | 9                         |\n| Non-cash investing activities:                                                                            |                           |                           |                           |\n| (Decreases)/additions to fixed assets for accrued capital expenditures . . . . . . .                      | (6)                       | 1                         | 20                        |\n\n## Note 28 Guarantees\n\nNRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. Examples of these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements, commodity sale  and  purchase  agreements,  retail  contracts,  joint  venture  agreements,  EPC  agreements,  operation  and  maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties, as well as affiliates. These contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. The Company is obligated with respect to customer deposits associated with the Company's retail operations. In some cases, NRG's maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability.",

Most of these letters of credit and surety bonds are issued in support of the Company's obligations to perform under commodity agreements and obligations associated with future closure and maintenance of ash sites, as well as for financing or other arrangements. A majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company to renew them on similar terms.\n\nThe material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as follows:\n\nAsset  sales -  The  purchase  and  sale  agreements  which  govern  NRG's  asset  or  share  investments  and  divestitures customarily contain guarantees and indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, or as a result of a change in tax laws. These obligations generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction. In several cases, the contract limits the liability of the indemnifier. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company currently has any material liability relating to such routine indemnification obligations, except for the California property tax indemnity for estimated increases in California property taxes of certain solar properties that  the  Company  agreed  to  indemnify  NRG  Yield  for,  as  part  of  the  agreement  to  sell  NRG  Yield  and  the  Renewables Platform. The California property tax indemnity is estimated to be $176 million as of December 31, 2020 and is included in the above table under asset sales guarantee obligations.\n\nOther guarantees - NRG has issued other guarantees of obligations including payments under certain agreements with respect to certain of its unconsolidated subsidiaries, payment or performance by fuel providers and payment or reimbursement of credit support and deposits. The Company does not believe that it will be required to perform under these guarantees.\n\nOther  indemnities -  Other  indemnifications  NRG  has  provided  cover  operational,  tax,  litigation  and  breaches  of representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who have provided services to the Company. NRG's maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications  can  range  from  a  specified  dollar  amount  to  an  indeterminate  amount,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.\n\nBecause many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company's liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the Company's liability would be, until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these contracts.",
