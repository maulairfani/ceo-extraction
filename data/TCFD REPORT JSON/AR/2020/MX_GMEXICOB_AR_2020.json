Our confidence in the future was and is unwavering .\n\nOur investments in the last ten years surpassed US$20 billion, which enabled us to consolidate this year as the largest industrial conglomerate in M\u00e9xico, with world-class assets and presence in four countries: M\u00e9xico, Per\u00fa, the US, and Spain.\n\nDuring 2020, Grupo M\u00e9xico's shares appreciated by 62% in MXN and 54% in USD, given the expectation of better market returns, productive capacity growth through investment, division-wide operating efficiency, financial discipline, higher metals prices, and the industrial and commercial reactivation since the fourth quarter.",
