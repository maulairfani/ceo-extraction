        "page_content": "## Chairman's introduction\n\n## Purpose during the pandemic\n\nThis year has taught us some valuable lessons, and underlined the importance of purpose in everything we do. Our strategy is working and we are confident Barclays is in a strong position for the challenges and opportunities ahead.\n\nFor most people, and indeed companies, the defining memory of 2020 will be the COVID-19 pandemic, which is of course still with us and has had such devastating consequences for the lives and livelihoods of millions around the world.\n\nWe have been fortunate in pursuing those priorities to have the commitment of so many dedicated and resilient colleagues. While many switched to working from home with remarkable adaptability, I would like to record particular thanks to the thousands who continued to work in branches, looked after clients from the trading floors, and staffed our contact centres so as to deal with a significantly heightened volume of questions from customers. It has been fantastically uplifting to witness the spirit in which our colleagues have taken on these challenges. Of course, our workforce was not immune to the worst health impacts of the virus either. For those colleagues we have lost or who suffered personally, or whose families have been affected, I extend my deepest sympathy.\n\nAs the pandemic unfurled, Barclays' priorities were clear. We first needed to ensure our operational and financial resilience, not least because banks would be called upon to play a key role in mitigating some of the financial and economic consequences of the crisis. That resilience then had to be put to real use in supporting our customers and clients. And we needed to do this while protecting the health and wellbeing of our many thousands of employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revisiting our Purpose\n\nWe want to ensure that, behind the headline, this real sense of Purpose is deeply embedded in the way in which the organisation takes decisions. This will not always be easy, and the interests of different groups of stakeholders can sometimes appear to collide, at least in the short term, but we will do our best to take the right decisions for the long term, even if that is not the easiest step in the short term.\n\nDuring the course of the last year, we revisited our expression of Purpose with a view to improving its connectivity to the actual things that we do day-in and day-out. Our commitment now is to 'deploy finance responsibly to support people and businesses, acting with empathy and integrity, championing innovation and sustainability, for the common good and the long term.'\n\nWe think that our statement of Purpose largely stood the test set by the pandemic. In an extremely difficult year for a lot of people and businesses, we deployed hundreds of millions of pounds in payment holidays and other schemes to support our retail customers, and lent billions of pounds more to those businesses, large and small, that needed it most to weather the immediate impact of the crisis.\n\nWe have done our best to support customers and communities in other ways. For example, we are very aware how frustrating it can be waiting to speak to a real person at times of high demand. At their peak, our contact volumes were up by 40%, while our contact centre capacity was cut by 70% as a result of the closure of operations in India and elsewhere\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndue to the pandemic. We were ultimately able to resolve this issue through a substantial deployment of technology to enable UK call centre staff to handle enquiries at home, as well as redeployment of some branch staff to bolster that capacity. We are appreciative of the patience and understanding shown by the vast majority of our customers.\n\nOne of our priorities for this coming year, and the years ahead, is to ensure that we 'bottle up' the agility and innovation that stood us in such good stead in weathering this crisis. This has prompted a far-reaching assessment of our operational mindset, and we will be embedding new ways of thinking about our work across the entire colleague population during the course of 2021, based in large part on lessons learnt from our experience in 2020.\n\nWith colleagues located in local communities around the UK, as well as near our big centres of operations in the US and India, we thought hard about other ways of making a contribution to the crisis response. A key element of our response was the launch of a \u00a3100m COVID-19 Community Aid Package, including a matching programme for colleagues. Of the \u00a395m donated to date, \u00a359m is already funding the COVID-19 relief efforts of 250+ charity partners around the world.\n\nThe pandemic also provided an opportunity - indeed a necessity - to innovate at unprecedented speed. The UK Government's Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) is a case in point, requiring us to go operationally live only a matter of days after being notified that the scheme was to be established.\n\n' We want to ensure that, behind the headline, this real sense of our Purpose is deeply embedded in the way in which the organisation takes decisions.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's introduction continued\n\nWe hope that initiatives such as this demonstrate clearly the ways in which Barclays can do good in society by deploying finance in multiple ways.\n\nFirst, the environment. Given the operational and other challenges of the last few years, Barclays had been slow to embrace its full responsibilities in the face of the climate challenge. Our shareholders and other stakeholders told us this, so we started a complete refresh of our environmental policies in the autumn of 2019. This led to our March 2020 announcement of our ambition to be net zero across scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050, and our commitment to align our financing to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nAs I said in my letter to shareholders and other stakeholders last year, we want to be increasingly proactive in making a substantive contribution in what we hope will become an age of greater corporate conviction. This is something all of our stakeholders expect of us. Let me take two examples:\n\nWe are extremely grateful for the support of practically all of our shareholders, who endorsed resolutions that we put before them in May 2020. Going forward, we have committed to be positive, thoughtful, authentic and open in our engagement with external stakeholders, and we recognise that the acceptable frontier of activity is moving very clearly in the direction of a green agenda. A further step was taken in November last year with the release of more detailed information on our targets, in particular in the energy and power sectors, and our overall framework for setting the measures by which we think we should be held accountable.\n\nIn June 2020, we established our Global Race at Work agenda with a goal of reinforcing our stance of zero tolerance on racism, and to improve opportunities and representation for ethnic minority colleagues. In October 2020, we presented colleagues with\n\nSecondly, we have been doing a lot more to embrace the Race at Work agenda. High profile incidents and protests in 2020 prompted organisations like Barclays to appraise what we have been doing to aid the fight against racism, and to ask ourselves: 'is it enough?'. We acknowledged that, despite our best intentions, the answer was likely 'no' and so we took action to address this.\n\nour 12-point Race at Work Action Plan focused on attracting, developing, advancing and retaining Black professionals at all levels. We have made tangible progress against each of these actions and, in 2021, we are now extending the work to include all other ethnically diverse colleagues, as well as customers, clients, and communities.\n\nOur results indicate that our strategy is working, though in a completely different way to that which we might have envisaged at the start of the year. We remain a British universal bank committed to a diversified but synergistic portfolio of businesses. We strongly believe that it is better to stand on two or three legs than one, particularly when financial resilience is such an important part of a bank's appeal to customers and clients. I think it is fair to say that this strategy, grounded in diversification, has been validated in the extreme stress we experienced this past year.\n\n## The right strategy\n\nDuring 2020, the normally reliable profitability of our UK activities was placed under severe pressure by the costs of addressing the pandemic, the impairment provisions that we made, and policy responses that have led to structurally much lower interest rates and a flatter yield curve. At the same time, the businesses in the Corporate and Investment Bank, and in particular our Markets business, benefited from significantly increased volatility and wider trading margins.\n\nMore broadly, and as described in the letter from Jes Staley, we also now wish to focus on more of a growth agenda, in particular in the capital markets businesses, in our Corporate Bank, in our digital platforms, and in our UK Wealth business.\n\nGiven the interest rate environment, and also the agility that the business demonstrated in our response to the crisis, it is clear that there is both a need and an opportunity for the transformation of our UK business. We seek, at the same time, to serve our customers, to assist the most vulnerable among that group, and roll out further opportunities for a more streamlined service taking advantage of the digital world. This represents the principal strategic challenge for the Group in the near term.\n\n## Reviewing our performance\n\nIt is disappointing of course that returns last year fell short of that, and hitting our targets, absent a significant change in the macroeconomic environment and interest rate structures in particular, has become harder and more distant. Nevertheless, we remain committed to improving returns and to attaining a >10% RoTE over time.\n\nThe Group's performance has, for understandable reasons, been greatly affected by the external events of 2020. We ended 2019 with an RoTE of 9.0% excluding litigation and conduct, and believe that we were well on course towards our medium-term target of >10%.\n\nWe did report a return on tangible equity of close to 10% in the Corporate and Investment Bank, but to deliver a greater than 10% RoTE across the board will require a return to higher levels of borrowing and transaction activity in our cards businesses, and the successful implementation of our plans for Barclays UK.\n\n## The Board\n\nOur intention remains returning a healthy proportion of profits, and surplus capital, to shareholders via dividends and/or share buy-backs. The full year 2019 dividend was cancelled in response to a request from the PRA, but we are pleased that sufficient confidence is returning to the system to allow a moderate return of capital in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nI am very grateful for the support and hard work of my Board colleagues during 2020, and in particular in responding to the extra commitments as a result of the pandemic and our desire to improve our environmental policies.\n\nI would like to thank Sir Ian Cheshire, who is retiring at this year's AGM, for the hard work he has put in over the last four years, notably in overseeing the successful establishment of Barclays Bank UK PLC\n\nI am delighted that Dawn Fitzpatrick, Mohamed A. El-Erian and Brian Gilvary have settled in so well. We are also very pleased to be welcoming Julia Wilson as a Non-Executive Director from April. These additions to the Board, and its overall strength, have enabled us to plan ahead for succession in key roles.\n\nas a ring-fenced bank and leading its independent board. It is very good news that Crawford Gillies has been willing to take on the role of Chair of Barclays Bank UK PLC as we head into the next stage of its business transformation. Thanks too to Mary Anne Citrino who stepped down from the Board in October.\n\n## The future\n\nBalancing decisions in a way that optimises our Purpose requires a Board in which constructive challenge, openness and diversity of background and opinion are prized, along with a commitment to act fairly and in the interests of all stakeholders. Your Board is well placed to help the Company stay true to its Purpose.\n\nNotwithstanding the positive progress made on the medical front, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to cast its shadow over the global economy for some time to come, and therefore continue to be the defining force affecting our business.\n\nFinally, I want to thank everyone involved in this most challenging of years - customers, clients, investors, regulators and governments. But above all, thank you to our colleagues, whose indomitable spirit has been a credit to themselves and to Barclays.\n\nI believe we are well placed to respond to the challenges that brings. Our diversified model has proved its value, and we have a clear view of our business priorities going forward. We are determined to shape our own future as a company, and we will seek to leverage our pioneering spirit to serve our customers, clients and the communities in which we live and work to the best of our abilities.\n\n## Nigel Higgins\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

That is why we did things like waiving charges and interest payments to help people cope during a very difficult period, while at the same time working with governments, particularly the UK Government, to deliver programmes to help businesses weather the storm.\n\n## Resilience and stability\n\nFinally, we knew we needed to embrace and support our colleagues within Barclays, recognising the challenges we faced on a personal and professional level.\n\nThis year, I am pleased with the way we have demonstrated our financial integrity, maintaining profitability throughout the year.\n\nWe have delivered a resilient performance, despite extreme contraction in the global economy, with Group PBT of \u00a33.1bn, and showed a capacity for strong capital generation.\n\nOur CET1 ratio as at 31 December 2020 was 15.1% - the highest level of capitalisation in Barclays' history - and our liquidity pool of \u00a3266bn represented 20% of the Group's balance sheet. We have \u00a39.6bn of provisions set aside for impairments.\n\nGiven that strength in our business, we have decided the time is right to resume capital distributions. As a result, we are pleased to approve a total payout of 5.0p per share, including a 1.0p 2020 full year dividend and the intention to initiate a share buyback of up to \u00a3700m. We expect to comment further on capital distributions as appropriate.\n\nWe ended the year therefore highly capitalised, highly liquid, and well provisioned for impairments. Most importantly, the Group's performance means we can make choices about our future from a position of strength and stability.\n\n## The right model\n\nOur British universal banking model remains core to our strategy for success, providing us with the diversification that has been critical to our performance. This year our model has demonstrated its capacity to deliver resilience through economic cycles, borne out in our relatively strong Group level results over a difficult macroeconomic period, driven by the performance of our Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBarclays is now the only British global investment bank with a leading presence in the US, competing at scale in a structurally attractive market as many of our European competitors pull back. As well as a positive for Barclays, this has the potential to become a strategically important proposition for the UK, providing a competitive edge for the economy here as more and more companies look for finance through the capital markets instead of via bank balance sheets.\n\nAt the same time, both Barclays UK and our Consumer, Cards and Payments business have faced significant challenges this year, enduring a severe economic shock, while also managing a long-term low interest rate environment, lower charges for overdrafts, and the elimination of certain banking fees.\n\n' Our British universal banking model remains core to our strategy for success, providing us with the diversification that has been critical to our performance.",

        "page_content": "Risk review\n\n## Chief Executive's review continued\n\nStructural challenges in the UK retail banking market have been evident for some time, but they have been brought into even sharper relief by COVID-19. Restoring Barclays UK to a position of strong and sustained profitability is now our principal near-term strategic challenge. Specifically, we need to deliver a better, more digital bank for consumers and small businesses; we need to address our cost base; and we need to increase our commercial engagement with a significant portion of customers where currently we generate too little income for the Group.\n\n## Support in challenging times\n\nI am encouraged by the progress we have already made on this front, but there is more to do in 2021 and beyond.\n\nThis year, when it mattered most, Barclays was there for our customers and clients, and for the communities where we live and work all over the world. We took significant steps to relieve financial pressure for our customers, for example in waiving over \u00a3100m of fees and interest charges, and in granting hundreds of thousands of payment holidays.\n\nWe also worked with governments to deliver support programmes, including facilitating some \u00a327bn in lending for British businesses. What the UK Government has done in terms of fiscal spending, through the furlough scheme and business loans, has been unprecedented. What the Bank of England has done in terms of monetary easing and providing liquidity to the financial markets, to encourage the markets to lend to businesses and other institutions, is on a scale way beyond anything we saw in the 2009 financial crisis. Both institutions are to be commended for being so decisive and bold in their actions to protect jobs and the economy.\n\nIn the UK, Asia, and across the Americas, we created a \u00a3100m COVID-19 Community Aid Package to work with local charities and support vulnerable communities hardest hit by COVID-19.\n\nI am proud of the way we moved so many people to remote working in a matter of days, providing the technology to support them, and investing in our physical spaces so we are able to return colleagues to work safely when circumstances allow. For those colleagues unable to work during the pandemic, I am pleased we were able to pay people in full, as well as offer financial support for things like childcare and self-quarantine.\n\nAs a company, we are deeply indebted to our 83,000 employees who have worked so hard over the last 12 months to keep Barclays delivering for its customers and clients, and for our other stakeholders too. From our branches, to trading floors, to call centres, thousands of our staff were designated key or critical workers, and, like everyone else, we have all had to adapt to new ways of working while taking the necessary steps to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have learnt an enormous amount about the character of this company, about our people's capacity to cope and adaptability, and about ways of balancing our work and personal lives - and we must apply that knowledge as the world transitions back to normal, hopefully in the course of 2021.\n\nOur experience this year also prompted us to look afresh at our Purpose as an organisation, and to make sure our Values are as up to date as they should be. This is a worthwhile exercise for any company to undertake from time to time, but I believe it was particularly important this year for us to take some time to reflect on who we are as a company, and what we stand for. I am confident that our renewed expression of Purpose and Values effectively encapsulates Barclays today.\n\n## Character and conviction\n\nThis crisis is clearly not over, but my hope is that Barclays will live up to its 330-year heritage, and emerge from this pandemic with pride in what we have done, and how we have helped.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Facts and figures\n\nReturn on tangible equity a\n\n3.4 % 2019: 9.0%\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio 15.1 % 2019: 13.8%\n\nIncome \u00a3 2 1 . 8 bn 2019: \u00a321.6bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperating expenses a \u00a3 1 3 . 7 bn 2019: \u00a313.6bn\n\nNote\n\na Excluding litigation and conduct.\n\n' This year, when it mattered most, Barclays was there for our customers and clients, and for the communities where we live and work all over the world.\n\nOne immediate example of our conviction as a company is last year's profoundly important announcement of our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050. Notwithstanding the disruption caused by COVID-19, we have undertaken significant work over the course of this past year to build out our approach. In November, we set out the details of the methodology and targets that begin to align the emissions we finance through our activity, with the Paris Climate Agreement, on the way to achieving our net zero ambition.\n\nWe believe that our 2050 net zero ambition is the best way for Barclays to help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, across all sectors, by harnessing the breadth and depth of our leading capital markets franchise to direct financing flows towards building a greener future.",

The capital markets - where companies, institutions, and governments issue securities, facilitated and underwritten by banks - drive the world's economic growth. Barclays aims to increase market share in our debt underwriting and equity issuance offering, building confidence in global liquidity and helping drive economic growth.\n\nSecond, we will accelerate the geographic roll out of Barclays' commercial banking expertise, building from our historic strength in the UK, and targeting rapid expansion in mainland Europe and the US. We will help corporations around the world manage their core financial needs, from liquidity management, to payments processing, to trade finance.\n\nAnd fourth, we will invest in the expansion of our wealth management business in the UK. Central to this is the extension of access to our investment platform and advice services to eligible banking customers, within our existing base. With our expertise we should be a major provider to hundreds of thousands more UK consumers as they plan for the future and invest in more attractive returning assets.\n\nThird, we are investing in our consumer banking and payments businesses to provide a payments led multiway value exchange ecosystem for customers and clients who interact with us across our digital platforms. To enable this, we will be launching a platform-based business model to offer new avenues of growth for our corporate and Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) clients, and provide differentiated products and services to our customers in the UK. This business model will further enhance the capabilities of our Payments and Consumer businesses, deepening the relationships with SMEs and corporates and expanding into mainland Europe. We will also connect corporates and our customers as we expand our partner focused consumer finance businesses in the UK, mainland Europe and the US.\n\nThrough 2021 we will continue to work on these opportunities, and look to strengthen diversification and deliver growth.\n\nFinally, and as always in these letters, I want to thank my colleagues for their steadfast commitment, and for all they do for Barclays, and our customers and clients every day around the world. I am privileged to lead such a group of people.\n\n## Thank you\n\nI want to recognise also the contribution of the management team for their leadership across the Group, particularly important in this past year. And we are grateful too for the stewardship, support and challenge - from our Chairman and the Board.\n\n## James E Staley\n\nAs I look to 2021, I remain, above all, committed to Barclays continuing to support and deliver for all our stakeholders.\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer, Barclays\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our strategy on pages 11 to 13 See our approach to managing risk on pages 48 to 49 See how we act in our society and environment on pages 39 to 43\n\nGo online at home.barclays/annualreport\n\n' I want to thank my colleagues for their steadfast commitment, and for all they do for Barclays, and our customers and clients every day around the world.

        "page_content": "## Operating environment\n\n## A rapidly changing world\n\nWe pay close attention to the environment in which we operate, scanning the horizon for risks and opportunities, and adapting our strategy accordingly. We also monitor trends in the behaviour of our customers and clients so we can effectively meet their evolving needs.\n\nThe health and economic impacts of COVID-19 continue to have significant implications for Barclays and our stakeholders. The global economy has experienced significant fluctuations in activity levels over the last 12 months, and GDP in many of our key markets is still below pre-pandemic levels. The implications for wider society, and the way we live and interact, have also been dramatic and will continue to be for some time.\n\nThroughout a challenging year, we are proud of the support we have been able to provide to our customers and clients. Now, we are committed to helping them rebuild and, where required, adapt to new trends that may arise in the coming years such as long-term implications for population centres or global supply\n\n' As the vaccine rollout continues to progress, we are optimistic about the opportunities that will exist for Barclays and for our customers and clients in a recovery environment.\n\nchains. As the vaccine rollout continues to progress, we are optimistic about the opportunities that will exist for Barclays and for our customers and clients in a recovery environment.\n\nWhere possible, and in line with local government guidance, we have instigated gradual returns to office working in certain parts of the business and parts of the world. In time, with the safety and wellbeing of colleagues as our first priority, we envisage more people will return to on-site working over the course of the coming months, more detail on which is set out in the people section of this report.\n\nNational governments around the world continue to implement measures to socially distance populations and restrict movement of people. This requires our operating model to adapt, innovate and be nimble, particularly in our capacity to manage disruption risks to our people, processes, infrastructure, and technology services. In March last year, we executed a major workforce transformation, migrating 70,000 colleagues to remote working in a matter of days. At the same time, we adapted working environments for colleagues and branch staff in the UK, as well as call centres globally, to ensure colleague and customer safety. We also stood up physical trading floors at designated emergency sites around the world to ensure uninterrupted service for our Investment Bank clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our strategy on pages 11 to 13 See our people and culture on pages 33 to 37\n\n## Interest rates and other economic consequences\n\nIn the financial markets, the last 12 months were characterised by initial periods of high volatility, market dislocation and significant trading activity, later stabilising across asset classes. The global markets revenue pool a grew by 30% in 2020, attributable to the period of heightened activity in the first part of the year. Capital markets issuance b rose by 9% as companies sought to strengthen their balance sheets.\n\nAs a direct result of the economic consequences of the pandemic, there have been changes in the financial environment that we have adapted to meet. In particular, we have seen a reduction in interest rates in many of the jurisdictions where we operate, intensifying an already long-term low-interest rate environment that we expect to endure for some time. This underlines the importance, and opportunity, of transformation of our business to adapt to the structural challenges of the retail banking market.\n\nThese trends illustrate the importance of Barclays' market infrastructure, allowing our clients to continue to access the global capital markets in a distributed workplace.\n\nWe have also seen significant increases in our impairment provisioning, and have further constrained our risk appetite. This has required a re-evaluation of our strategic and investment priorities, set out in more detail elsewhere in this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our strategy on pages 11 to 13\n\n## Customer and client behaviour\n\nAt the same time, we continue to observe a growing trend towards online transactions and servicing, further reducing customers' use of our branch infrastructure. Downloads of our mobile banking apps continue to increase as more and more customers look for ways to self-serve. As a consequence of lower spending and increasing cash reserves, we also continue to see a reduction in credit card balances and an increase in repayment volumes. Growth of the use of credit alternatives, and growth in precautionary savings, has also meant an increase in customer appetite for financial advice.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on society has accelerated a number of existing trends in consumer behaviour and preferences. In the last 12 months, for example, we have seen a further shift away from cash usage towards contactless payments as customers adapt to and embrace the low-touch environment necessitated by the pandemic. Contactless payments now account for 78% of total transactions within Barclays UK, increasing 8% since March 2020.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Dealogic for the period covering 1 January to 31 December 2020.\n- a Coalition Greenwich, Preliminary FY20 Competitor Analysis.

        "page_content": "## Operating environment continued\n\nThese trends present significant opportunities for Barclays to transform and continue to improve our services, finding further efficiencies through technology and automation, and creating new business models and partnerships based on digital engagement, customer trust, and our Payments capabilities.\n\nWithin our Markets business, we continue to observe a shift in client preferences from active to passive fund management as well as the greater tendency towards electronic trading. This drives the need for the further digitalisation of our platforms, in turn generating higher volumes at tighter spreads, greater speed of execution and with lower costs for us and for our clients.\n\nThis emphasis is important because we continue to operate in a highly competitive environment. The rapid growth of ecommerce continues, amplified even further by the pandemic, and a number of payments focused FinTechs have benefited from this trend. This creates an imperative for Barclays to continue investing in new digital architecture, not only to keep pace with competitors, but at a rate that allows us to develop ahead of them.\n\nAgain, this has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular as clients look to more digital means of execution in a distributed working environment. Here too, we are seeing a growing emergence of non-banking players, often leveraging a core competency in technology to accelerate their offering.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our strategy on pages 11 to 13 See our divisional review on pages 25 to 31\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Political and regulatory change\n\nIn the United States, we expect the new administration, along with central banks, to continue to want to focus on liquidity facilities and bank capital strength, in addition to leading the efforts of the Financial Stability Board to implement international standards, such as Basel III. Trading relationships with the rest of the world, particularly China, will continue to have direct implications for our clients.\n\nGeopolitical events have implications for our operating environment, and political volatility continues to influence customer and client needs and behaviours. The long-term economic consequences of the pandemic may also have important monetary and fiscal impacts, including changes to tax and government spending in a number of jurisdictions, which is also likely to impact client needs.\n\nIn Europe, agreement between the UK and European Union (EU) over the shape of its future trading relationship is positive. The UK is also actively pursuing new trading relationships with other parts of the world, which have the potential to lead to an increase in cross-border activity for our customers and clients. Within the UK, there is the possibility of continued political tension over the prospect of a Scottish independence referendum following Scottish parliamentary elections this year.\n\nBarclays remains subject to ongoing and significant levels of regulatory change in different jurisdictions around the world. In particular, we continue to pay close attention to the changing landscape of prudential requirements and supervisory expectations, changing approaches to stress testing, as well as policymaker focus on the derivatives market across the G20 countries and beyond.\n\n## Climate change\n\nLooking ahead, we are optimistic about some of the additional opportunities the transition to a low-carbon economy will present for Barclays, including through increased green and infrastructure finance capabilities. Gradual changes to the structure of our economy are likely to be accelerated by advances in sustainable technologies, which will require us to be able to support new industries, and help customers in impacted industries adapt.\n\nAs the global effort to tackle climate change grows, Barclays is moving rapidly to take a leading role in contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy. In March last year, we set out our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050. In November 2020, on the way to achieving that ambition, we set out the methodology and targets that begin to align the emissions we finance with the Paris Climate Agreement. More information is set out in our ESG Report, published alongside this document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee how we act in our society and environment on pages 39 to 43\n\nFor more information please see our ESG resource hub at home.barclays/esg\n\nPost the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the UK continues to develop a new framework for financial services regulation. We anticipate a new architecture for rule-making and an increase in public policy and legislative activity in the near term, including the potential for changes in regulatory approach between the UK and the EU. We also await the conclusion of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reviews into the retail banking market and cost of credit.",

We have taken steps to join up and strengthen the way we think about our service across all of our businesses to present a single, compelling face to our customers and clients. This interconnection is reinforced by our common core operating platform, BX, which facilitates the sharing of expertise and ideas across the Group.

This enhances customer experience and the reach of our products, and it also reduces costs, creating the capacity to finance further investment in automation and a virtuous circle of multi-year cost efficiencies. As well as significant cost opportunities, new income streams have also become possible, for example, our Plan & Invest platform, a digitally delivered advice and investment offering for current account customers in the UK, launched in September 2020.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognised that digital access was a necessity and worked to accelerate investment in our digital and automation agenda, helping customers bank and transact with us more easily.\n\nIn our Corporate Bank, we continue our three-year plan to improve our clients' digital experience, supporting more and more to self-serve in line with their needs. Last year, we successfully migrated Barclays iPortal from legacy physical infrastructure to the cloud, providing a more resilient and cost effective platform.\n\nFinally, in a year that saw a peak of over 70,000 colleagues working remotely, the value of our strategic investment in digital infrastructure was plain to see. Within a matter of days, Barclays enabled a huge number of people to make that transition, deploying c.\u00a351m of IT kit, infrastructure and home office equipment to improve capabilities.\n\nIn our Markets business, we continued to increase the scale of our network and platforms, extending our electronic capabilities, including our BARX and options offerings.

We think about our priority stakeholders as belonging to four groups: customers and clients, colleagues, society, and investors.\n\n## Customers and clients\n\nOur customers and clients are at the heart of everything we do. We are relentless in our commitment to their best interests and we must engage with them regularly to help us achieve that.\n\nIn 2020, we engaged with customers and clients in a wide variety of ways, including running regular surveys, analysing customer complaints, and drawing on data from millions of individual transactions and personal customer interactions.\n\n## What do they tell us?\n\n## Customers told us:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 to be there and provide support, expertise and guidance, for important financial decisions.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 to make things easy and intuitive so they can self-serve and complete (simple) everyday tasks, via a digital channel when it's convenient for them.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 to help them stay in control of their finances by providing tools, and information tailored to their specific financial circumstances.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 to be there for local communities and businesses, helping them adapt to the changes brought about by the pandemic.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 to be reliable, always available and to keep their money and data safe.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nOur people are our most valuable asset. They make a critical difference to our success, and our investment in them protects and strengthens our culture.\n\nOur long established approach to regularly engaging with colleagues, Unite, the Barclays European Forum and other colleague forums, ensures we listen and take all perspectives into account in our decisionmaking and action plans. As a result of COVID-19, many of our events this year have been web based, although, where possible, we have supported colleagues in our branches and offices with site visits.\n\n## What do they tell us?\n\nIn addition to our annual employee opinion survey, this year we have run regular Here to Listen surveys to understand how colleagues were feeling during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a specific focus on wellbeing, working remotely and work/life balance:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 77% believe they have the work tools and resources they need to achieve excellent performance (2019: 56%).\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 83% of colleagues believe Barclays supports colleague wellbeing (2019: 74%).\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 74% believe the stress levels at work are manageable (2019: 61%).\n\nThe data and insights from our surveys form an important part of our decision-making, and continuing to improve these scores is a priority.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 78% say they have been able to balance their personal and work demands.\n\n## How do we respond to them?\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 39% of colleagues have registered for our Be Well portal (2019: 23%).\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Mental Health Awareness training completed by 96% of colleagues (2019: 27%).\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Spent c.\u00a351m on IT kit, infrastructure and home office equipment to ensure 70,000 colleagues were set up to work remotely.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our Diversity and Inclusion networks are at an all-time high, with over 23,000 colleagues now involved.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We implemented a 12-point Race at Work action plan to open up opportunities to attract, develop and add to our great Black talent.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our overall Inclusion Index score for 2020 is 76%, with 89% of colleagues saying they feel included in their team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof colleagues believe Barclays supports their wellbeing\n\n8 3 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof colleagues completed Mental Health Awareness training\n\n96 %\n\n## How do we respond to them?\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Facilitated c.\u00a327bn of financing to businesses through the UK Government support schemes.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Helped businesses and institutions raise c.\u00a31.5trn of new issuance in the capital markets.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Provided over 680,000 payment holidays for customers globally.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Made significant improvements to our Barclays apps, including enhanced payment alerts, and the ability to see itemised digital receipts.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Waived c.\u00a3100m in overdraft interest and banking charges for UK customers and clients.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Introduced Dream Accelerator to help first time homebuyers get onto the property ladder sooner.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Launched Plan & Invest, a digital investment service that creates a personalised investment plan, tailored by our experts.\n\nc.\u00a31.5 trn raised across Equity and Debt Capital Markets in Q220-Q420\n\nbusinesses through UK Government support schemes\n\nc . \u00a3 2 7 bn financing provided to",

The Directors also took into account the views and interests of a wider set of stakeholders, including the Group's pensioners, regulators, the UK Government and non-governmental organisations. You can find out more about how Barclays engages with its stakeholders on the previous pages. The Directors recognise that having a good understanding of the views and interests of the Group's key stakeholders will help them to deliver the Group's strategy in line with its Purpose and to operate the business in a sustainable way. Consistent with its regulatory responsibilities, the Board also considers carefully the impact its decisions will have on the Group's risk and control environment, and on customer outcomes. Considering a broad range of stakeholders and their relative interests is an important part of the way in which the Board makes decisions, although in having regard to those different perspectives it is not always possible to deliver everyone's desired result or necessarily achieve a positive outcome for all stakeholders.\n\n## How does the Board engage with stakeholders?\n\n## Engagement in action\n\nDepending on the decision in question, the relevance of each particular stakeholder group may differ, and equally the Board adopts a variety of methods of engagement with different stakeholder groups. The Board will sometimes engage directly with particular stakeholders on certain issues, but the number and distribution of the Group's stakeholders and the size of the Group overall means that stakeholder engagement often takes place at an operational level. In addition to direct engagement with stakeholders by Board members, the Board regularly receives reports and considers and discusses information from across the organisation to help it understand the impact of the Group's operations on, and the interests and views of, the Group's key stakeholders. As a result of these activities and the information it receives, the Board has an overview of engagement with stakeholders, and other relevant factors, which enables the Directors to comply with their legal duty under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nRead on to find out how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172 when discharging their duties, and the effect of those considerations in reaching certain decisions taken by them, in the context of (i) establishing the Group's climate strategy, and (ii) responding to the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Engagement in action: Climate change\n\n1\n\n3\n\nThe Board recognised that Barclays can, and should, make a real contribution to tackling climate change, and help to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Board also recognised, however, that we were behind where we needed to be, and approached the challenge to help accelerate the transition in a positive, thoughtful, authentic and open way. Having begun in the autumn of 2019 to review our environmental policies with a view to making the step-change required, in the first quarter of 2020 the Board established a Board Climate Committee, to oversee our activities in this critically important area.\n\nThe Board and its Climate Committee recognised that delivering on this ambition would involve balancing the needs and expectation of a range of key stakeholders and that gaining a detailed understanding of the views of those stakeholders would be key to making meaningful progress. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2020 we began an extensive stakeholder engagement programme, led by the Chairman, personally, and the Company Secretary. This engagement programme was undertaken in three parts initially, following which we took action and reported back to our stakeholders:\n\n## We engaged and listened\n\nFirst, we engaged and listened. We sought to understand the views and expectations of major shareholders, shareholder representative bodies, shareholder activists, non-governmental organisations, and stakeholders from across society more broadly. We also took into account the views of customers, clients and employees. The feedback was consistent and clear: the vast majority of our stakeholders wanted Barclays to take a leadership position in addressing climate change.\n\n## We developed proposals\n\nSecondly, we developed proposals, with the benefit of the rich and valuable feedback we had received from our stakeholders. We formulated an ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and developed real and tangible commitments to align our provision of financing across all sectors, starting with the energy and power sectors, to the goals and timelines of the Paris Climate Agreement. We developed a clear strategy, with specific targets and regular reporting.\n\n## We tested our proposed new approach and strategy\n\nThirdly, we tested our proposed new approach and strategy with many of the same stakeholders as well as with representatives of governments, and various customers, clients and suppliers, to check whether what we were proposing aligned with their aspirations for us. We made refinements to our proposals based on the feedback we received.\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Section 172(1) statement continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n## We acted\n\nThen, we acted. The Board always intended that our new approach should be a binding commitment on our part. It was clear that many of our shareholders, as well as other stakeholders, wanted this commitment to be reflected in a shareholder resolution. The Board also believed that this was the right thing to do. With the advice and support of its Climate Committee and on the recommendation of management, the Board resolved to put its own binding resolution to shareholders to give the maximum force and effect to its new approach and strategy. Shareholders gave their overwhelming support to this resolution at our AGM in May 2020. The Board also approved the creation of a new Executive Committee role focused on driving the execution and evolution of our climate strategy, and so began the process of embedding into the business the changes our new commitments required.\n\n## We reported back\n\nAnd finally, we reported back. Having set our ambition and formalised our commitments, the Board undertook to develop, with the help of a range of stakeholders, detailed metrics for measuring our progress and targets against which we would report and be held to account, and to report on progress by the end of the year. Continuing their respective oversight roles throughout, the Board and its Climate Committee approved materials for publication and, on 30 November 2020, we delivered on this commitment.\n\nAddressing the climate challenge is a monumental task and opportunity and we are committed to playing our part. Doing so will not only help to build Barclays' reputation and to secure its long-term success by mitigating associated risk, but will also help deliver meaningful change for the benefit of society at large, and also enable Barclays credibly to access the business opportunities that playing an active role in the transition will present.\n\nEngagement with our stakeholders has been integral and essential to the progress we have made so far, but this is the start of a journey and we have a long way to go. Our success over the long term is inextricably tied to the progress of our communities and the preservation of the environment, and continued engagement with our stakeholders will therefore be integral and essential also to our future success.\n\nDeveloping and delivering on our climate change strategy has required us to take account of the sometimes conflicting needs and expectations of different stakeholder groups and to have regard to these in a fair and balanced manner. The Board also had to give due consideration to important issues such as energy transition and the impact of our decisions on businesses and the wider communities in which they operate, as well as to our relationship with various key stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can find further information about our climate change strategy on pages 39 to 43 in our society and environment section.\n\n## Engagement in action: COVID-19\n\nBetween formal meetings, the Board has received regular updates on the implementation of the Group's strategy, in particular in relation to the Group's participation in the UK Government schemes and its broader support for customers and clients, as well as its ongoing engagement with key stakeholders and the steps being taken to safeguard the health and wellbeing of customers and colleagues. Given the importance of the Group's response to the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on stakeholders and the economy as a whole, the Board also set up a Board COVID-19 Crisis Response Committee in April.\n\nThroughout almost the entirety of 2020 the primary focus of the Company and the Board has been on how best to deliver its strategy while at the same time supporting the Group's stakeholders through the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has meant the Board has met, whether in person (when permitted) or by video conference calls, significantly more frequently than in previous years, in order to devote the time needed to address the challenges which have arisen and to provide the necessary support to customers, clients, colleagues and society more broadly while continuing to drive value creation over the longer term.\n\nThis Committee met initially weekly and then fortnightly until well into the summer of 2020, in order to act both as a point of escalation for considering material matters arising during the crisis and as a review and sounding board for business decisions made by management which might impact the reputation of the Group. Close co-ordination between the Board and the Chairs of the main subsidiary boards has also ensured an ongoing dialogue has been maintained across the Group throughout the crisis, resulting in a more co-ordinated response to the crisis.\n\nSet out overleaf is a summary of some of the key decisions and actions the Group has taken in response to the impact of the ongoing pandemic where the Board has had regard to the interests of, and impact on, affected stakeholders, including consideration of stakeholder engagement, feedback received, the key decisions made by the Board and the potential outcomes of those decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the following pages we describe the Board's consideration of the interests of our four priority stakeholder groups:\n\n- \u25a0 Colleagues\n- \u25a0 Customers and clients\n- \u25a0 Society\n- \u25a0 Investors\n\nFor further detail on Governance please see pages 59 to 142 of Part 2 of the Annual Report",

This has been achieved through the provision of safe access to bank branches, putting in place a programme to achieve effective social distancing and a stringent cleaning routine. Balancing the needs of our customers and clients against their health and safety and that of our colleagues has been crucial and so, while such measures included notifying customers and clients of reduced opening times, we also sought to enhance our call centre facilities in order to deal with increased volumes. We also took steps to support vulnerable customers who were unable to visit a branch.\n\nIn order to support our customers and clients financially throughout these unprecedented times, the Board supported management in making appropriate adjustments to the Group's strategy and policies. This has included decisions to support the Group's credit card and borrower customers such as the implementation of payment\n\n## Colleagues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board has regarded colleagues' wellbeing as being of paramount importance throughout the pandemic.\n\nTogether with management, the Board has sought to support colleagues both financially (by minimising job losses), and by ensuring our working environments are as safe as possible, both for colleagues who have continued to work from our offices or branches and for the 70,000 colleagues who moved to work remotely. For our offices and branches, this has meant the introduction of health and safety measures across our sites, including restricting occupation levels, enhanced hygiene and cleaning measures, and social distancing. We established a formal risk assessment process across our sites, and a COVID-19 Health and Safety Forum, who have overseen our approach to protecting colleagues' health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Board, with management, has also ensured that colleagues have been provided with the necessary tools to enable the shift to remote working, including by the provision of increased technological support, laptops and other home office equipment. We also helped colleagues cope with some of the personal challenges the pandemic created, including offering paid leave\n\nto support self-quarantine, sickness or care for dependants and financial help with childcare, as well as the provision of education and training tools, including increased support in relation to mental health and wellbeing, and support services and helplines.\n\nIn assessing the Group's future strategy, the Board will take into account the lessons learnt during the pandemic and, in particular, will monitor changes in customer and client banking patterns and the ability of colleagues to provide services through remote working, in order to assess whether these changes could be adopted in the longer term so as to provide greater flexibility in terms of working practices for colleagues once the pandemic is over.\n\nColleagues across the Group have also made a considerable contribution towards charitable giving during the year. Much of this has been provided through the COVID-19 Community Aid Package announced by the Group Chairman on behalf of the Board in early April 2020. Colleagues have been able to support charities of their choice, local to their homes or places of work and which are working to support communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with Barclays match-funding colleague contributions. We have been pleased to note strong engagement with the match-funding initiative.\n\nColleague surveys have been conducted on a number of occasions throughout the year in order to maintain ongoing engagement and gather feedback, and reported to the Board. In addition to the colleague surveys and regular updates from management, members of the Board have continued to engage with colleagues in a variety of ways throughout the pandemic. These included holding virtual town halls, and interactive video call sessions. You can read more about how we support the health and wellbeing of our colleagues and about our workforce engagement more generally on page 16 and in Our people and culture on pages 33 to 37.\n\nholidays, the waiver of interest and fees on overdrafts and forbearance on late payments, as well as facilitating borrowing under the various government loan schemes.\n\nThe rationale for these changes has been to provide breathing space for customers; to appropriately reflect the impact of the pandemic on customers' income and circumstances in affordability calculations and credit decisions given the unprecedented uncertainty as a result of the pandemic. See our strategy on pages 11 to 13 for further information.\n\nAll of this has been achieved while maintaining an appropriate risk and control environment. Through regular updates from the Board Audit Committee, the Board Risk Committee and management, the Board has closely scrutinised the risk and control environment across the Group, and ensured that the ongoing support for customers and clients during the pandemic has been achieved while continuing to adopt a robust approach to risk and control so as to maintain a strong capital position for the longer term.\n\nThe Board has paid particularly keen attention to updates from management on various metrics and tools used to measure customer and client satisfaction and had been pleased to note that feedback on the Group's support during 2020 has been positive.\n\nThe Board and senior management will continue to monitor customer and client behaviours and preferences - whether arising from ongoing concerns over social distancing or from a change in customer and client banking patterns, or greater use of online services rather than branch or call centre facilities - and this information will help inform the Board's decisions on future strategy as it evolves to meet the long-term needs of our customers and clients.",

In this regard, given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board concluded that the long-term interests of the Group and its responsibility towards supporting customers, clients and society more broadly in dealing with the impact of the pandemic, were of paramount importance, even if that might inevitably be less favourable in terms of investor returns in the short term.\n\nIn light of the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and following engagement with the Group's regulators, the Board decided, in line with its peers and in\n\nresponse to a request from the UK Prudential Regulatory Authority, that it was prudent not to undertake any interim ordinary share dividend payments, accrual of ordinary share dividends or share buy-backs in 2020; and likewise that it should cancel the ordinary share full year 2019 dividend which was due for payment in April 2020.\n\nThese were difficult decisions for the Board, not least in terms of the adverse short-term impact on investors, but the Board concluded that this was right and prudent in order to preserve additional capital so as to allow the Group to continue to serve the needs of its customers and clients throughout the crisis. The Board is pleased that the continuing strong capital position of the Group means that it has been able to resume paying a dividend to ordinary shareholders.\n\nThe Board considers engagement with its shareholders as being critical to its understanding of investors' views. The AGM is an important event in the Company's corporate calendar and an excellent opportunity to engage with shareholders and for shareholders to ask questions of the Board. Despite the impossibility of shareholder attendance at the 2020 AGM as a result of the UK Government's prohibition on public gatherings because of the pandemic, the Board ensured that all shareholders had the opportunity to submit questions in advance of the AGM. All questions were considered carefully and answered individually and pre-recorded presentations by the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive were made available on the Group website on the day of the AGM. In addition, as noted in the section above entitled 'Climate change', extensive shareholder engagement took place both in person, where possible, and remotely in the lead-up to the AGM in the context of seeking shareholders' views on and support for the Group's approach to climate change. Following the AGM, the Board has continued to maintain its engagement programme with investors, notwithstanding the inability to meet face to face.\n\nFind out more about our engagement with our investors on page 17.\n\npartnerships with trusted charities that can have a direct and immediate impact in the communities where we have a presence.\n\nThe package also comprised a commitment to match-fund personal donations and fundraising efforts made by colleagues to charities of their choice supporting COVID-19 relief. A wide range of colleagues have since made donations through the COVID-19 Community Aid Package, including the Group Chairman and two Executive Directors who each personally donated one third of their respective Group fees and fixed pay for six months of 2020.\n\nWe have also continued to engage with local communities throughout the pandemic, to understand their needs and develop alternative solutions to enhance the provision of our services where possible, including by working closely in communities across the UK to help them access and feel confident in using our digital services through our team of Barclays Digital Eagles.\n\nThe Board is pleased to note that external feedback has been very positive in relation to the Group's support of society both through the maintenance of its financial services and the delivery of our COVID-19 Community Aid Package.\n\nThe Board is committed to develop its future strategy so as to continue this support and engagement with local communities and society more broadly through the remainder of the pandemic and its aftermath during 2021.\n\nRead more about our work supporting our local communities in Our society and environment on pages 39 to 43.",

Ultimately, the experience of our stakeholders is the key indicator as to whether we are succeeding.\n\nWe use a number of sources to assess our performance and provide a balanced review of performance during the year.\n\nThis approach means we are better able to deliver positive and sustainable results for our stakeholders, while at the same time maintaining flexibility for our businesses to adapt in a fast-moving world.\n\nFinancial targets and strategic non-financial performance measures are also linked to the way we pay our colleagues, including at executive management level.\n\nWe consider a range of metrics across all stakeholder groups and continuously assess whether new measures should be added or removed from our dashboards. For example, in recent years digital engagement and related customer satisfaction scores have become increasingly important.\n\nKey measures used in our 2020 assessment include the metrics reported on this page, and in the broader discussion of our performance on the subsequent pages of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I knew I needed to act quickly to protect not only my team, but my growing family too. So, I picked up the phone to Ian Jarvis, my relationship manager at Barclays. Ian was already familiar with my business and my plans for long-term development, so when I called, he was ready. He helped me access a CBILS loan, to ease cashflow and support growth, and worked closely with me to create a solid development plan.\n\nI created CMe Media to help British brands with their advertising and campaign needs.

        "page_content": "## Divisional reviews Barclays UK continued\n\n## Year in review\n\nWe endured severe economic shock, while incurring additional costs, driven by our response to the pandemic. We waived fees and charges and interest payments and we worked with UK regulators and Government to provide ongoing support for our customers and clients.\n\n2020 was a highly varied and challenging year for Barclays UK, which required immediate and balanced actions to support millions of our customers and clients impacted by the pandemic.\n\nDespite a turbulent year, Barclays UK continued to deliver against our strategic priorities.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We took significant steps to relieve financial pressure for our customers, acting quickly and effectively at a time of maximum need. Over the course of the year, we waived \u00a3100m of fees and interest charges and granted hundreds of thousands of payment holidays. Over 650 of our branches (80% of the total estate) remained open throughout the pandemic and over 250 staff received additional training to answer calls from customers experiencing financial difficulty.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we played a key role in the facilitation and delivery of the UK Government's business support schemes, designing and executing a digital application system within days, overcoming significant operational challenges. Over the course of the period to 8 January 2021, we lent \u00a310.1bn to British businesses under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) and \u00a31.2bn under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). This is the equivalent of four years of traditional lending volumes, condensed into less than 12 months. This represents a significant number of new customers to Barclays through the Government schemes, providing us with an opportunity to establish long-lasting relationships for the future.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Despite facing significant challenges this year and enduring a severe economic shock, we continued to meet more of our customers' needs by simplifying our credit and debit card offerings. We eliminated certain fees and charges to better reflect how our customers interact with us and we made changes to our overdrafts fees and charges to protect our most vulnerable customers. We also continued to deliver digital innovation with 67% of our products provided to customers through digital channels. Currently, 70% of our products are available via a fully digital solution or self-service enabled.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We made significant improvements to our Barclays apps, which have over 9.2m active users. We introduced Dream Accelerator to help customers looking to buy their first home, enabling them to access tools to help them in the home buying preparation process. Our customers can now also view itemised digital receipts directly from the Barclays app when they shop at participating retailers, removing the need to carry paper receipts and helping customers better manage their spending.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Complaints across Barclays UK in 2020 were significantly lower than in 2019, decreasing 32%. This was, in part, a consequence of the pandemic and lower business volumes but also thanks to great strides we have made in reducing complaint volume year on year. In Q1 2020, prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, we saw lower year on year complaint volumes, driven by robust management actions. NPS for Barclays UK and Barclaycard has remained relatively stable at +15 and +8 respectively. NPS scores across the market have softened as customers continue to feel the financial pressure of the pandemic and ongoing movement restrictions. While the market remains challenging, Barclays UK has continued to deliver support and assistance to customers.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We launched Plan & Invest, a new digital investment service that provides customers with the confidence and support to invest for the future. Plan & Invest creates a personalised investment plan, tailored to our customers' goals, with dedicated support at every step. Customers\n\ncan stay updated over the phone and in an online hub, and see how well their investments are tracking against their financial goals.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We continued to build strategic partnerships, including launching a new collaboration with Nextdoor, a fast-growing social network service, to help thousands of local businesses secure new customers by arranging free advertising on the platform.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 While managing a long-term low interest rate environment, we have driven strong Mortgage application volumes this year, and maintained competitive service levels for our customers. Despite the pandemic, we have continued to support customers with their home buying needs and have seen a strong performance in Mortgage completions, particularly through the second half of the year.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We accelerated our green agenda by leveraging environmentally friendly material for our debit cards, reducing paper statements sent to our customers, and expanding our plastic reduction programme. We also supported 'green' agricultural lending across SMEs and will continue to explore opportunities to go further. Through our Barclays Partner Finance business, we plan to expand the distribution of Green Finance across a range of home improvement assets that aid in reducing energy consumption.\n\nCustomer expectations continue to evolve, with more interactions moving to digital or via a virtual channel (call, video or web chat) and more customers seeking expert guidance for their specific financial circumstances. We also continue to see a reduction in the use of our branch infrastructure and a significant shift away from cash usage towards contactless payments. Where appropriate, we will continue reshaping our footprint to better support the customers we serve in ways they want to be serviced.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nBarclays UK is working to build a better bank for customers, a more efficient bank that is safe, intuitive and that will support customers and businesses responsibly and sustainably. Our focus is on customers\n\n## Money Mentors - a free and impartial mentoring service\n\nCustomers can now book a free session with one of our 300 Money Mentors, asking questions playing on their minds without fear of judgement. The service responds to millennial customers who told us they wanted a more open forum to talk through their financial concerns and goals. We had over 2,000 conversations in 2020, with over 80% of customers saying they will do something different with their finances as a result.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the full story go online at barclays.co.uk/money-mentors/\n\nand clients and putting them at the heart of the decisions we make about running our business and shaping it for the future.\n\nWe will continue to invest in digital platforms, remove unnecessary processes and costs and make it seamless for customers to self-serve. We will continue to invest in digitalisation and automation to be more efficient, reduce costs and to create additional capacity for colleagues to support customers.\n\nWe are reinventing our service model for customers to create a more efficient, more resilient and seamless service, which will include the expansion of our Wealth Management proposition. We are building partnerships in the open market and working across the whole of Barclays to deliver additional value for our customers and businesses through our size and scale.\n\nIn recent years we have invested in cloud technology and begun to build our digital bank capabilities, removing reliance on a heritage core. This investment will continue and will provide a strong digital customer platform that stands out from our competitors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information go online at home.barclays/annualreport",

In the UK, Corporate Banking deposits grew by 22% during the year, and we had over 600 net new client wins, illustrating the extent to which our corporate clients trusted us during a time of uncertainty.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 In Banking, we helped some of the world's largest governments, corporations and public institutions issue debt in order to help them manage the strain that the COVID-19 pandemic placed on their operating environments. In total, we helped our corporate clients raise c.\u00a31.6trn and governments, government-related clients and supranationals raise c.\u00a3430bn in 2020. While our Banking global fee ranking b fell to 7th in 2020 from 6th in 2019, largely attributable to a decline in activity in the sectors where we have relative strength, our revenue growth of 8% is testament to a resilient performance in a challenging year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our Markets business acted as a market-maker and liquidity provider to institutions across the globe, playing a pivotal role in allowing them to manage risk during a time of unprecedented disruption. Despite a challenging environment, we were able to gain share c to 4.9% (2019: 4.3%), maintaining our global revenue ranking c at 6th - the largest non-US bank. In line with our strategy, we have made significant progress in our multi-year effort to provide our clients with market-leading electronic capabilities.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We continued to invest in enhancing our digital proposition, including our electronic trading capabilities and our digital self-service platform. Our BARX (cross-asset electronic trading) and options platforms continue to benefit from sustained multi-year investment. The user base of iPortal, our digital self-service platform, grew in 2020, and we are seeing a continued reduction in cost to serve through digital adoption. In order to ensure a seamless experience, we have invested in resilience, with client-impacting technology incidents down 14% compared to last year.\n\n## The World Bank - sustainable financing to help combat COVID-19\n\nAs the pandemic spread, the World Bank wanted to raise funds to support its member countries. Barclays participated as a joint lead manager on a record-breaking US$8bn Sustainable Development Bond, a transaction that was part of the World Bank's issuance programme to support the financing of sustainable development projects and programmes. At a critical moment, when cautious investors were looking for signs of confidence in an uncertain market, we were proud to be able to support the World Bank and its members as they work to prevent, detect and roll out vaccination programmes, as well as to strengthen health systems, and sustain economies for the long term.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We continued to broaden our digital footprint business across Europe, with our Transaction Banking offering now digitally live across nine key EU countries, without the overheads of a branch network. Despite the challenging environment, we on-boarded over 640 new clients and attracted over \u00a32bn of new deposits in the year.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We also continued to enjoy a strong partnership with our colleagues in BX, including in our Transaction Banking business, which had significant demand placed on its technology infrastructure during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the rapid deployment of the UK Government schemes and the distribution of support via Local Authorities. We remain committed to growing capital-light businesses across our expanded geographic presence and through investment in our digitalised offering.\n\nAcross our Corporate and Investment Bank, we will remain focused on maintaining our client-centric approach and, in doing so, developing opportunities to grow our business and increase returns. We will continue to focus on growth in high-returning, capital efficient parts of our business and to sustain our focus on cost discipline and operational rigour.\n\nBanking will continue to invest in select sectors, particularly Health Care and Technology, in the US and Europe to improve revenue contribution from our equity and advisory offerings and help us narrow the gap to our US peers. We will continue to build our Sustainable and Impact Investment Banking team, ensuring that we accelerate our efforts to support growth stage companies as well as our broader client base on implementing ESG.\n\nWe will look to make further, selective investments for the long term, establishing ourselves as the leading European Corporate and Investment Bank, competing on an even footing with our US peers and operating at the most efficient scale possible.\n\nIn Corporate Banking, we will look to continue the investment in our digital proposition and in our European offering, a critical enabler for Barclays' ambitions across the continent. We will also focus on steadily improving our credit portfolio returns by reallocating risk weighted assets to higher-returning opportunities as well as making selective investments in expanding the footprint of our US Corporate Banking offering.\n\nMarkets will continue to focus on growing balances, driving client-centricity and building a large and stable income base. We will keep investing in low-touch electronic execution platforms, to drive efficiency and scale, and will also seek to utilise the strength of our integrated financing platform to drive growth in client balances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information go online at home.barclays",

For us, it creates an exciting new capability for existing and future partners. As part of our push to broaden our product set, we also launched our card-based Equal Payment Plan proposition, which helps customers finance purchases with our partners.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We forged new partnerships across all our businesses, notably in the US, where we signed a multi-year partnership agreement with Emirates, the world's largest international airline, as well as successfully renewed partnerships with key clients across our US Consumer Bank and, as such, maintained our position as a top 10 credit card issuer in the US a . Additionally, we signed a multiyear agreement for a card programme relationship with AARP, the largest non-profit, non-partisan organisation in the US dedicated to empowering people aged 50 and older to choose how they live as they age.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The investments we have made in digital servicing have allowed us to reach a digital active user rate of 71.4% and enabled strong delivery of customer supporting programmes, including payment relief and merchant disputes. The NPS for the US Consumer Bank in 2020 was +35, demonstrating an increase on our 2019 score b .\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our Payments business maintained its position as one of the largest payment processors in Europe c , and secured significant new client relationships, and retained others, including BT/EE and The Range. We also launched the first phase of our Smartpay Fuse gateway solution - an intermediary merchant service that provides omnichannel transaction processing services - through our relationship with CyberSource, a Visa solution. This complements our existing suite of gateway solutions and enables us to bring best-in-class commerce products to more clients in the UK and Europe.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 In Germany, we continue to be a leading lender in credit cards d as well as providing loans. This year, we established a new partnership with leading ecommerce provider, Amazon, to offer their customers instalment lending at the point of purchase - a product that has seen increased popularity in the market.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our Private Bank continues to strive to become a leading investments house for Ultra High Net-Worth (UHNW) and High Net-Worth (HNW) customers and Family Offices, offering more complex solutions in collaboration with our Corporate and Investment Bank. By leveraging the global reach of our universal banking model to seamlessly deliver capabilities, we have won numerous notable client mandates. We have seen significant inflows into our discretionary investment offering as we deliver continued outperformance, as highlighted by our Multi-Asset Portfolio award at the 2020 Wealth Manager Investment Performance Awards in association with Asset Risk Consultants. Additionally, our sustainable solutions won 'Best ESG Investment Fund: Multi Asset' at the ESG Investing Awards 2020, aligning to our wider sustainability ambitions.\n\nAcross our Consumer, Cards and Payments businesses, we will look to accelerate our strategy to invest in and build world-class technology and digital capabilities. This includes our focus on building out a new platformbased business model, to be launched later this year, to offer differentiated products and services in partnership with our clients, to Barclays' customers.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen an increase in the number of customer complaints in the US Consumer Bank, however we have largely identified the root causes and have plans in place to address these going forward.\n\nIn the US, as we continue to pursue a partnershipcentric business model, we are extending our product set to deliver incremental value to our existing partners and win new partners across a broader range of sectors.\n\n## BT Group - payments services that enhance the customer experience\n\nIn 2020, we were proud to be selected as the primary strategic payments processing partner for the whole of BT Group, meeting their ambition to consolidate their acquiring needs into a single, best-in-class supplier.\n\nThis follows a long-standing relationship with BT that has provided first-class payments services to their sizeable EE business for over a decade, and we are now exploring exciting new opportunities for additional value added services such as card-linked loyalty and partner offers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will drive further scale in our Payments business through best-in-class digital capabilities, expanding and diversifying our customers and partnerships, and unlocking further opportunity in Europe. We will remain closely aligned with the Corporate Bank and Business Banking in Barclays UK to maximise value for clients and leverage our proprietary digitally integrated merchant platforms to deepen penetration.\n\nThrough more seamless client journeys for our Private Banking clients, we will aim to drive operational efficiency and develop our existing platforms as part of our digitalisation agenda.

It has been an incredible journey and coming to America has provided a very different perspective on issues such as #blacklivesmatter.\n\nIt's important to support Black talent in the financial service industry - and not just within Barclays. We've created an action plan for colleagues to open up new opportunities to attract, develop and add to our Black talent. It will also help break down the unconscious bias deeply ingrained in all of us.\n\nMy day job is as a relationship manager, but my passion role is co-chair of our Black Professionals Forum, which is part of Embrace, Barclays international network dedicated to championing our multicultural workforce.\n\nWe are now expanding our plan to other ethnically diverse colleagues. We are also going to enhance our long-standing support for citizenship programmes that are dedicated to tackling racial inequalities in communities.\n\nWe are working with colleagues, customers, clients and communities to attract, develop and add to our Black talent.\n\nToks Sotande-Peters Relationship Director, International Corporate Banking New York City",

Nevertheless, we have continued to invest in our colleagues in order to strengthen our business and protect our culture. Our people have shown extraordinary adaptability and resilience, and thanks to them so has Barclays.\n\nAs ever, our approach to our people is informed by the latest thinking in behavioural and data science, and by our capacity to track effectiveness and progress over time.\n\nThe strength and success of Barclays is in our people. We want to support their health and wellbeing, enable them to build their career and empower and motivate them to be able to provide excellent service.\n\n## Measuring success\n\nColleague engagement 83 % 2019: 77%\n\nFemales at Managing Director and Director level\n\n26 % 2019: 25%\n\n'I would recommend Barclays as a good place to work'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n87 % 2019: 80%\n\n'I believe that my team and I do a good job of role modelling the Values every day'\n\n94 % 2019: 92%\n\n## Adapting to challenge\n\nWe put in place a set of global principles to ensure we were doing as much as possible to support our people. This included instigation of new working patterns and technology. We also helped colleagues cope with some of the personal challenges the pandemic created, including offering paid leave to support self-quarantine, sickness or care for dependants, financial help with childcare and advice made available to help protect physical and mental health. Through our colleague surveys, we have also regularly checked in with our people to better understand the impact that working through the pandemic has had.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, colleagues around the world have been working incredibly hard to continue to support our customers and clients. Many were designated as frontline or critical workers in the countries in which they work. 70,000 colleagues moved to remote working. At all times, we have worked tirelessly to prioritise each other's safety and wellbeing, as well as to taking all necessary steps to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nBarclays continues to believe that people working together in the same physical location reinforces our culture and helps with collaboration and inspiration. Where possible, and in line with local government guidance, we have instigated gradual returns to the office in certain parts of the business and in certain parts of the world. In time, with the safety and wellbeing of colleagues as our first priority, we envisage more people will return to on-site working. In advance of this we have already put in place additional measures to ensure we are COVID-secure, including risk assessments at our sites and Return to Office Crews to support social distancing and minimise risks.\n\n## Hiring the best people\n\nOver the last 12 months, we have learnt an enormous amount about the benefits and challenges of working more flexibly. Ultimately, we believe this will inform our ambitions for future ways of working.\n\nWe continue to focus on hiring people with skills that help us accelerate our digital transformation, as well as the fast-changing needs of our customers and clients.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the heart of our hiring strategy is our ability to match locations to the local talent pool in that area. This includes reaching out to local communities and upskilling local students. We are acting swiftly to adapt to changes in hiring demands and volumes because of COVID-19, particularly in customer-facing areas where it is now, more than ever, key that we are providing support.\n\nWe retain an emphasis on hiring from within. In 2020, we filled around 36% of role vacancies internally and added a further 961 graduates to our internal pipeline of future leaders. This was one of our most gender diverse class of graduates ever, with almost 40% female. COVID-19 has meant moving all candidates to a virtual experience, including for over 2,500 graduates, interns and apprentices. To ensure individuals feel supported and connected to the business, we have appointed talent coaches and created extra opportunities for virtual networking and collaboration\n\nPeople with different perspectives and life experiences make our organisation stronger. We are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a workforce that is as diverse and inclusive as possible. We are an equal opportunities employer and our policies require us to give full and fair consideration to all populations based on their competencies, strengths and potential. As ever, we are increasingly relying on data and analytics so we can understand how to improve our hiring process.\n\nso that social connections are formed. We also continue to invest in our flagship career development programmes, including our AFTER programme to support those who have been in the armed forces.\n\nWe also know the importance of measuring our progress. In particular, we have set ourselves a number of targets to ensure we are creating a more gender diverse workforce. Our ambition is to achieve 28% female Managing Directors and Directors by the end of 2021. Currently 26% of our Managing Directors and Directors are female, and 29% of our UK Managing Directors and Directors are female.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' Over the last 12 months, we have learnt an enormous amount about the benefits and challenges of working more flexibly. Ultimately, we believe this will inform our ambitions for future ways of working.\n\n## Developing talent for the future\n\nA wide range of development opportunities are available to help colleagues build their careers, delivered through our digital learning platform, Learning Lab, which makes development more available than ever. We also continue to operate our two flagship leadership development programmes: our Enterprise Leaders Programme; and our Strategic Leaders Programme, driven by our belief that quality leadership makes a difference to our success. We track the progression of people that have participated in these programmes to see how effective they are.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, all development content went virtual in 2020, and we invested a total of \u00a323m in training. We launched e-learning programmes to help people working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as online training to provide information to help keep everyone safe. Through our regular Here to Listen surveys, we have listened carefully to what colleagues have told us about the realities of working remotely, and tailored our training and support materials accordingly.\n\nWe have invested in the tools, programmes and technology needed to enable colleagues to work smarter, collaborate more easily and so that we can unlock the power of the connections between our people. In our latest Your View survey, 77% of colleagues told us they have the work tools and resources needed to achieve excellent performance, up 21 percentage points on last year. We also want to help colleagues balance their work life with their personal commitments, supporting career development opportunities at each life stage. We offer enhanced maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental entitlements in all our major jurisdictions.\n\nhome.barclays/diversity\n\nWe remain committed to closing pay gaps at Barclays.

The Group's global workforce was 89,015 (48,447 male, 40,563 female, 5 unavailable), with 495 senior managers (388 male, 107 female), and the Board of Barclays PLC had 12 directors (9 male, 3 female) as at 31 December 2020. This is on a headcount basis, including colleagues on long term leave. Unavailable refers to colleagues who do not record their gender in our systems. 'Senior managers' includes Barclays PLC Group Executive Committee members, their direct reports and directors on the boards of undertakings of the Group, but excludes Directors on the Board of Barclays PLC. Where such persons hold multiple directorships across the Group they are only counted once. The definition of 'senior managers' within this disclosure has a narrower scope than the Managing Director and Director female representation data provided above.\n\n## Creating an inclusive and supportive culture\n\nIn 2020, we increased our focus on embedding a culture of inclusion and encouraged colleagues to become allies in the workplace. Through a new toolkit we supported them to take conscious, positive steps to make everyone feel that they belong, and develop empathy towards another group's challenges or issues. In our Your View survey, 84% of colleagues told us they believe we are all in this together at Barclays, while 82% say they believe leaders are committed to building a diverse workforce.\n\nCreating an inclusive and supportive culture is not only the right thing to do, but also best for our business. It creates a sense of belonging and value and enables colleagues to perform at their best. We focus on five areas: disability, gender, LGBT+, multicultural, and multigenerational. Each area is embedded in the business through colleague networks to provide support and advice, create development opportunities and raise awareness of issues and challenges. Membership of our colleague diversity networks is at an all-time high, with over 23,000 colleagues now involved in one or more of our diversity networks. This also influences our people policies, teaching us how we need to adapt to give our people the support they need to succeed.\n\nWe also closely track the ever-changing composition of our people through online dashboards, to make sure that our senior leaders understand the diverse makeup and needs of the organisation they lead. In 2020, we launched our Inclusion Index, which is one way we have been able to measure how included our colleagues feel. It has enabled us to use data to assess the impact of our initiatives and lay a benchmark for monitoring progress year on year. Our overall Inclusion Index score for 2020 is 76%, while 89% of colleagues say they feel included in their team.\n\nEvents last year rightly prompted organisations like ours to appraise what we have been doing to aid the fight against racism, and to ask ourselves whether we can do more. Over recent months, Barclays has worked extensively with its Black colleague forums in both the UK and the US to produce a Race at Work Action Plan. The plan comprises a thorough set of actions that will open up new opportunities to attract, develop, and add to our great Black talent, using data to measure success. From 2021, we will expand our plan to include all ethnically diverse groups as well as actions to enhance our long-standing support for citizenship programmes dedicated to tackling racial inequalities in communities, as well as support of this agenda for customers and clients.\n\nThrough our BeWell programme, we continue to provide expert advice and guidance on the practical steps colleagues can take to look after their physical and mental health. In 2020, our Mental Health Awareness e-learning became mandatory, and we regularly check in with managers to ensure they are supporting colleagues' wellbeing. We were also one of the first businesses to sign up to the Mental Health at Work Commitment. In our Your View survey, 83% of colleagues told us that Barclays supports their efforts to enhance their wellbeing.\n\nWe want to become one of the most accessible and inclusive FTSE companies for all our customers, clients and colleagues. We require managers to give full and fair consideration to those with a disability on the basis of strengths, potential and ability, both when hiring and managing. We also ensure opportunities for training, career development and promotion are available to all. As part of the UK Government Disability Confident scheme, we encourage applications from people with a disability, or a physical or mental health condition. In response to feedback at the end of 2019, we undertook a review of workplace adjustment processes in order to improve our colleagues' experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can find more information in our Diversity and Inclusion report available at home.barclays/annualreport\n\n## Employee statistics\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some of these costs are estimated, and some are reliant on employee self-reporting. The overtime costs include all overtime paid above the normal hourly rate.\n\n## A continuous conversation with colleagues\n\nOur regular Here to Listen and Your View surveys are a key part of how we track engagement. In 2020, in part in response to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, we improved the effectiveness and regularity of how we do this.\n\nWe think colleague engagement should be a two-way exercise, with equal weight placed on listening to our people as it is on keeping them informed. We want to be able to consider our colleagues' perspective when we make decisions, including at the most senior level.\n\nWe saw a 5 percentage point increase in the response rate to our annual Your View employee engagement survey with 67% of colleagues responding. The results showed an increase in our engagement levels, up 6 percentage points, to 83%, and an increase of 7 percentage points, to 87%, of colleagues saying they would recommend Barclays as a good place to work. We were also very pleased to see that our colleagues have continued their focus on customer and client feedback, with 81% responding favourably to this question. In addition, 94% of respondents said they believe they and their teams do a good job of role modelling the Values every day, an increase of 2 percentage points.\n\nWith that said, we recognise there are also areas where we need to do more. We saw a 1 percentage point drop to 78% this year in the number of colleagues who feel it is safe to speak up, while colleague feedback also indicates we have room to make our internal processes more user friendly, with only 65% of colleagues saying work processes make it easy for employees to be productive.\n\nOverall, we are encouraged by our ability to work remotely in many more roles than we had previously thought possible.

This extends to those who work for us indirectly as well, such as contractors, although in a more limited way. As of 2020, our supplier Code of Conduct requires organisations with more than 250 employees to demonstrate that they have an effective workforce engagement approach of their own.\n\nWe monitor our culture across the organisation, and in individual business areas, through culture dashboards. These combine colleague survey data with other metrics about our business, so leadership can identify areas of continued strength of our culture and areas of focus for leaders.\n\nThe results from our surveys are an important part of the conversations our Executive Committee and Board have about our culture and how we run Barclays. We also update the Board and its relevant subcommittees throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to these data sources, our leaders engage regularly with colleagues locally to hear what they think. Where possible this year, leaders visited branches or trading floors to support colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the majority of engagement activities moved to virtual forums, with opportunities for face-to-face engagement being more limited due to social distancing requirements, including large-scale virtual town halls, training and development activity, mentoring, informal breakfast sessions, committee membership, ex-officio roles, diversity and wellbeing programmes, focus and consultative groups.\n\nDirect engagement, a comprehensive reporting approach and dedicated time at Board meetings, helps our Board take the issues of interest to our colleagues into account in their decision-making. This has enabled them to confirm that our workforce engagement approach is effective.\n\nWe make sure we are keeping everyone up to date on the strategy, performance and progress of the organisation through a strategic, multichannel approach. This combines leader-led engagement, digital and print communication, blogs, vlogs and podcasts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year we also provided additional regular updates to colleagues to provide practical advice and support, including via a dedicated COVID-19 intranet page.\n\nWe regularly brief our union partners on the strategy and progress of the business, seeking their input on ways in which we can improve the colleague experience of working for Barclays. The collective bargaining coverage of Unite in the UK represents around 84% of our UK workforce and 50% of our global workforce. We consult in detail with colleague representatives on major change programmes affecting our people. We do this to help us minimise compulsory job losses wherever possible, including through voluntary redundancy and redeployment.\n\n## Our policies\n\nWe expect our people to treat each other with dignity and respect, and do not tolerate discrimination, bullying, harassment or victimisation on any grounds.\n\nOur people policies are designed to provide equal opportunities and create an inclusive culture, in line with our Values and in support of our long-term success. They also reflect relevant employment law, including the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n\nWe are committed to paying our people fairly and equitably relative to their role, skills, experience and performance - in a way that balances the needs of all our stakeholders. That means our remuneration policies reward sustainable performance that is in line with our Purpose and Values, as well as our risk expectations. You can find more information in our Fair Pay Report, available on home.barclays/annualreport\n\nWe encourage our people to benefit from Barclays' performance by enrolling in our share ownership plans, further strengthening their commitment to the organisation.

And an additional grant from the Unreasonable Impact COVID-19 Response Initiative helped us get fresh, healthy food to those who needed it most through lockdown.\n\nBy providing fresh food with a significantly reduced environmental impact, we lead the way in next-generation farming.\n\nMike Zelkind CEO, 80 Acres Farms Hamilton\n\n<!-- image -->",

We do that through the choices we make about how we run our business, and through the commitments we make proactively to support others in our communities to achieve their goals.\n\nWe prize sustainability, and are passionate about leaving things better than we found them. We cannot be successful in the long term without recognising that we are at our best when our clients, customers, communities, and colleagues all progress.\n\n## Measuring success\n\nSocial and environmental financing \u00a3 6 0 . 9 bn 2019: \u00a334.8bn\n\nOperational carbon emissions tonnes CO2 equivalent\n\n83,072 2019: 134,347\n\nRenewable Electricity RE100 target (started 2019)\n\n74 % 2019: 60%\n\n## Tackling climate change\n\n## Our net zero ambition\n\nWe believe Barclays can make a real contribution to tackling climate change and help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nIt is our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050. We are already net zero in the context of our own emissions; our focus now is on reducing the client emissions that we finance. That starts with aligning our financing with the Paris Climate Agreement - the international treaty on climate change adopted in 2015.\n\nTo help us do that, it was necessary to create a methodology that builds on and extends existing industry approaches beyond just lending, to include capital markets. This better reflects the breadth of our support for clients through our investment bank, and we are the first bank to implement such an approach. We call our methodology BlueTrack\u2122.\n\n## What does 'net zero' mean?\n\nStopping global warming requires halting further human addition of long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. This can be achieved by stopping emissions, or by removing the same amount of GHGs from the atmosphere as are added in a given year. Achieving either of these outcomes can be referred to as having reached 'net zero emissions'. We expect to use some level of negative emissions to offset any residual gap-to-net-zero, although our approach is principally focused on emissions reduction.",

Green financing supports the transition by providing investment that is specifically focused on green activity, including for renewables, energy efficiency and sustainable transport. This includes specific products such as Green Loans, Green Project Finance, and Green Bonds, and there is increasing demand for more innovative products, such as Sustainability Linked Loans and Bonds.\n\nWe facilitated a total of \u00a360.9bn in total social, environmental and sustainability-linked financing in 2020, up 75% from \u00a334.8bn in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, we updated our Sustainable Finance Framework, which sets out our approach to classifying financing as sustainable, and references industry guidelines and principles. We welcome and encourage greater global harmonisation in the way this financing is defined, and will be working with other financial institutions and stakeholders towards this goal.\n\nOn a cumulative basis since 2018, we have facilitated \u00a3124.2 bn against our \u00a3150bn social and environmental financing commitment, and accelerated delivery against our \u00a3100bn green financing commitment, with a total of \u00a332.4bn to date driven by growing momentum across our businesses, products and geographies. We hope to continue this acceleration as we work closely with our clients to help deliver the investment required to make the transition.\n\nWe also issued the second Barclays Green Bond in October 2020. Funds from the \u00a3400m bond are allocated to mortgages on energy efficient residential properties in England and Wales. More than half the funds raised will be allocated to refinance Barclays' Green Home Mortgage products, which are offered to customers at a discount provided their property meets certain energy efficiency thresholds.\n\n## Managing our operational footprint\n\nOur Sustainable Impact Capital Initiative will invest \u00a3175m of equity capital in sustainability-focused start-ups, helping to accelerate our clients' transition to a net zero future. We hope these investments will advance innovative carbon-efficient technologies and supply-chains, and help to develop viable markets for carbon capture and sequestration.  Through the initiative, we aim to fill growth-stage funding gaps and help accelerate and scale catalytic and strategic solutions to environmental challenges. As of the end of 2020, we have invested \u00a324m and are actively working on more.\n\nWe use high-quality offsets to eliminate any residual or unavoidable emissions from our own operations, making us net zero today for what are called Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\nIn 2020, we continued our work on improving the operational efficiency of our property portfolio, achieving a total of 8GWh of energy savings. In parallel, we have continued to increase our procurement of renewable electricity to 74% across our operations in the UK, continental Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the US. We are on track to meet our 2021 target.\n\nWe are committed to going further to minimise the absolute emissions that we need to offset. As a member of the RE100 initiative, we are committed to sourcing 100% renewable electricity - targeting 90% by 2021 and 100% by 2030 at the latest.\n\nIn combination, these factors have contributed to a further reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, which now stand at 71% below our 2018 baseline.\n\nAs well as playing our part in accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, we also have an important role to play in managing climate-related risks, particularly as a significant institution in the global financial system.\n\n## Managing climate-related risks\n\nWe broadly categorise climate risks into three types: transition risk, physical risk and connected risk. Within these broad categories we identify a number of factors arising from climate change which we monitor over the short, medium and long term. We manage these risks through our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF). It sets our strategic approach for risk management by defining standards, objectives and responsibilities for all areas of Barclays. It is complemented by frameworks, policies and standards, aligned to individual Principal Risks.\n\nIn March 2020 we released our updated Climate Change Statement which sets out our approach to managing the impact of our climate-related activities. We have developed an internal standard to reflect these positions in more detail and, together with other climate-related statements and standards (such as the Forestry & Agricultural Commodities), these now determine our approach to climate change and relevant sensitive sectors. These standards sit under the management of Reputation risk within the ERMF and are enforced through an existing transaction origination, review and approval process.",

Barclays also waived c.\u00a3100m of interest and fees to customers, and committed \u00a3100m to a COVID-19 Community Aid Package.\n\n## Financial performance in 2020\n\nDespite the pandemic, Barclays remained profitable every quarter during 2020 and delivered a full year Group profit before tax of \u00a33.1bn (2019: \u00a34.4bn, including a PPI provision of \u00a31.4bn), attributable profit of \u00a31.5bn (2019: \u00a32.5bn), a RoTE of 3.2% (2019: 5.3%) and EPS of 8.8p (2019: 14.3p).\n\nBarclays' diversified business model delivered a resilient operating performance, allowing capital distributions to shareholders equivalent to 5.0p per share.\n\nTotal income increased 1% to \u00a321.8bn versus prior year due to the following:\n\nBarclays UK income of \u00a36.3bn, down 14% versus prior year reflecting lower unsecured lending balances and interest rates, and COVID-19 customer support actions, partially offset by mortgages growth.\n\nWithin Barclays International, CIB income of \u00a312.5bn, up 22% due to strong Markets income reflecting market share gains c in a buoyant trading environment, as well as strong Banking income, resulting in the best ever year on a comparable basis for both businesses d . CC&P income of \u00a33.4bn, down 22%, driven by lower credit card balances, margin compression and reduced payments activity.\n\nPre-provision profits e were broadly stable at \u00a38.1bn despite the pandemic, benefiting from the Group's diversified business model, which included a strong performance in CIB offset by headwinds in Barclays UK and CC&P.\n\nCredit impairment charges increased to \u00a34.8bn (2019: \u00a31.9bn) due to the deterioration in economic outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current year\n\ncharge is broadly driven by \u00a32.3bn of non-default provision for expected future customer and client stress and \u00a30.8bn of single name wholesale loan charges. The expected credit loss provision remains highly uncertain as the economic impact of the global pandemic continues to evolve.\n\nOur CET1 capital ratio increased 130bps in the year to 15.1%, reflecting headroom of 3.9% above our maximum distributable amount (MDA) hurdle of 11.2%.\n\nGroup operating expenses increased 1% to \u00a313.7bn which included structural cost actions and additional COVID-19 related costs, resulting in a cost: income ratio, excluding litigation and conduct, of 63%.\n\nBarclays understands the importance of delivering attractive total cash returns to shareholders and announced a total payout equivalent to 5.0p per share, consistent with the temporary guardrails announced by the PRA in December 2020, comprising 1.0p 2020 full year dividend and the intention to initiate a share buyback of up to \u00a3700m, which is expected to commence in Q121.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Across Equity and Debt Capital Markets in Q220-Q420.\n- a Total payment holidays granted as at 31 December 2020, business lending and commercial paper issuance data as at 12 and 15 February 2021 respectively.\n- c  Coalition Greenwich, Preliminary FY20 Competitor Analysis.

The Group's capital management objective is to maximise shareholder value by prudently managing the level and mix of its capital. This is to ensure the Group and all of its subsidiaries are appropriately capitalised relative to their minimum regulatory and stressed capital requirements, and to support the Group's risk appetite, growth, and strategic options while seeking to maintain a robust credit proposition for the Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## CET1 ratio\n\nThe ratio expresses the Group's CET1 capital as a percentage of its RWAs. RWAs are a measure of the Group's assets adjusted for their associated risks.\n\nBarclays views operating expenses as a key strategic area for banks; those which actively manage costs and control them effectively will gain a strong competitive advantage.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n## Cost: income ratio\n\n## Group RoTE\n\nThe cost: income ratio measures operating expenses as a percentage of total income and is used to assess the productivity of our business operations.\n\nRoTE measures our ability to generate acceptable returns for shareholders. It is calculated as profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders as a proportion of average shareholders' equity excluding non-controlling interests and other equity instruments adjusted for the deduction of intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nThis measure indicates the return generated by the management of the business based on shareholders' tangible equity. Achieving a target RoTE demonstrates the organisation's ability to execute its strategy and to align management's interests with those of its shareholders. RoTE lies at the heart of the Group's capital allocation and performance management process.\n\n## Our performance in 2020\n\nThe CET1 ratio increased to 15.1% (2019: 13.8%), reflecting headroom of 3.9% above the MDA hurdle of 11.2%.\n\n## CET1 ratio\n\nCET1 capital increased by \u00a35.5bn to \u00a346.3bn reflecting resilient capital generation through \u00a37.9bn of profits before tax, excluding credit impairment charges of \u00a34.8bn, and a \u00a31.0bn increase due to the cancellation of the full year 2019 dividend. These increases were partially offset by \u00a30.9bn of AT1 coupons paid and the announced 1.0p full year 2020 dividend. The CET1 capital increase also reflects regulatory measures for IFRS 9 transitional relief, prudent valuation and qualifying software assets.\n\nThe Group remains in a strong capital position, acknowledging likely headwinds in 2021 including procyclical effects on RWAs, reversal of regulatory forbearance applied through 2020 and increased pension contributions.\n\nRWAs increased by \u00a311.1bn to \u00a3306.2bn primarily due to higher market volatility, increased client activity and a reduction in credit quality within CIB, partially offset by lower consumer lending.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nCOVID-19 related expenses are likely to remain elevated in 2021. However, the Group will continue to drive efficiencies while investing in its franchise where appropriate.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% to \u00a313.7bn, including structural cost actions and additional COVID-19 related costs, resulting in a cost: income ratio, excluding litigation and conduct, of 63% (2019: 63%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further detailed analysis of our financial performance in 2020, please see our full Financial review and our Financial statements on pages 239 to 258,  and pages 259 to  376 respectively of Part 2 of the Annual Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group targets a CET1 ratio in the range of 13-14%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nCOVID-19 related expenses are likely to remain elevated in 2021.

However, given the COVID-19 pandemic, a meaningful improvement in returns versus 2019 was not possible due to the challenging operating environment.\n\n## Group RoTE\n\nThe Group continues to target a RoTE of greater than 10% over time.\n\nRoTE, excluding litigation and conduct, was 3.4% (2019: 9.0%) due to lower profit before tax including materially higher credit impairment charges relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher operating expenses, partially offset by favourable income.\n\nCost discipline remains a priority and we continue to target a cost: income ratio below 60% over time.\n\nFor more information on our global tax contribution as well as our approach to tax, please see our Country Snapshot report avaliable at home.barclays/annualreport",

These risks are managed as part of our business model.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Framework\n\nThe ERMF governs the way in which Barclays identifies and manages its risks.\n\nAt Barclays, risks are identified and overseen through the ERMF, which supports the business in its aim to embed effective risk management and a strong risk management culture.\n\nThe management of risk is then embedded into each level of the business, with all colleagues being responsible for identifying and controlling risk.\n\nRisk appetite defines the level of risk we are prepared to accept across the different risk types, taking into consideration varying levels of financial and operational stress. Risk appetite is key to our decision-making processes, including ongoing business planning and setting of strategy, new product approvals and business change initiatives.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Group sets its risk appetite in terms of performance metrics as well as a set of mandate and scale limits to monitor risks. During 2020, the Group's performance remained within its risk appetite limits.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nThe second line of defence is made up of Risk and Compliance and oversees the first line by setting limits, rules and constraints on their operations, consistent with the risk appetite.\n\nThe first line of defence is comprised of the revenuegenerating and client-facing areas, along with all associated support functions, including Finance, Treasury, Human Resources and Operations and Technology. The first line identifies the risks, sets the controls and escalates risk events to the second line of defence.\n\nThe third line of defence is comprised of Internal Audit, providing independent assurance to the Board and Executive Committee on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current, systemic and evolving risks.\n\nAlthough the Legal function does not sit in any of the three lines, it works to support them all and plays a key role in overseeing Legal risk throughout the Group. The Legal function is also subject to oversight from the Risk and Compliance functions (second line) with respect to the management of operational and conduct risks.\n\n## Monitoring the risk profile\n\nDuring 2020, Barclays ran a range of scenario analyses to determine potential outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic which informed management actions. One of the scenarios was a macroeconomic stress test which considered, among other factors, a no deal Brexit and a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in which scientific progress was limited to the extent that no vaccine was available throughout 2021. In addition, a Group-wide, exploratory stress test was performed against a severe but plausible climate scenario, testing vulnerability to disorderly transition risks and elevated physical risks. The aim of the tests was to identify key vulnerabilities that were most relevant and material to the Group's business model and geographical footprint. The results of these tests met Group risk appetite.\n\nTogether with a strong governance process, using business and Group level Risk Committees as well as Board level forums, the Board receives regular information in respect of the risk profile of the Group, and has ultimate responsibility for Group risk appetite and capital plans. Information received includes measures of risk profile against risk appetite as well as the identification of new and emerging risks.\n\nWe believe that our structure and governance supports us in managing risk in the changing economic, political and market environments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further detailed analysis of approach to risk management and risk performance, please see our full Risk review on pages 143 to 238 of Part 2 of the Annual Report\n\n' We believe that our structure and governance supports us in managing risk in the changing economic, political and market environments.",

This time frame is used in management's Working Capital and Viability Report (WCR), prepared at the start of February 2021. The WCR is a formal projection of capital and liquidity based upon formal profitability forecasts. The availability of the WCR gives management and the Board sufficient visibility and confidence on the future operating environment for this time period.\n\n## Time horizon\n\nThe three-year time frame has also been chosen because:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 it is also within the period over which internal stress testing is carried out\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 it is within the period covered by the formal medium term plans approved by the Board which contain projections of profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and capital resources\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 it is representative of the period and level of anticipated regulatory change in the financial services industry.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe Directors are satisfied that this period is sufficient to enable a reasonable assessment of viability to be made.\n\nIn making its assessment the Board has:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 carried out a robust and detailed assessment of the Group's risk profile and material existing and emerging risks (see material existing and emerging risks section), in particular those risks which senior management believes could cause the Group's future results of operations or financial condition to differ materially from current expectations or could adversely impact the Group's ability to meet regulatory requirements\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 reviewed how those risks are identified, managed and controlled (further detail provided on pages 48 to 49)\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered the Group's medium-term business plan\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered the WCR which provides an assessment of forecast CET1, leverage, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, as well as the build-up of MREL up to the end of 2023\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 reviewed the Group's liquidity and funding profile, including forecasts of the Group's internal Liquidity Risk Appetite (LRA) and regulatory liquidity coverage ratios\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered the stability of the major markets in which it operates, supply chain resiliency and regulatory changes\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered the Group's viability under specific internal stress scenarios\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered the sustainability of any future capital distributions;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered factors that may inform the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including (among other things), provision and future removal of government and central bank support schemes, changing macroeconomic variables, further waves of the pandemic, successful deployment of vaccines and emergence of new strains\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered scenarios which might affect the operational resiliency of the Group\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered the impact of the Group's ambition to be a net zero carbon bank by 2050 and support its clients' transition to a low-carbon economy\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 reviewed the draft statutory accounts and the in-depth disclosure of the financial performance of the Group\n\n## Assessment\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 reviewed the possible impact of legal, competition and regulatory matters set out in Note 26 to the financial statements on pages 337 to 341.\n\nRisks faced by the Group's business, including in respect of financial, conduct and operational risks, are controlled and managed within the Group in line with the ERMF. Executive management sets a risk appetite for the Group, which is then approved by the Board. Risk and Compliance set limits, within which businesses are required to operate.\n\nA full set of material risks to which the organisation is exposed can be found in the material existing and emerging risks on pages 147 to 158 in Part 2 of the Report.\n\nManagement and the Board then oversee the ongoing risk profile. Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Board and Executive Committee over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current and evolving risks.\n\nCertain risks are additionally identified as key themes and monitored closely by the Board and Board Committees. These are chosen on the basis of their potential to impact viability over the time frame of the assessment but in some instances the risks exist beyond this time frame.",

In particular, uncertainty as to the effectiveness of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the manner in which trading arrangements will be enforced by both the EU and the UK and uncertainty over current and future provision of financial services to EEA-based clients.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to the Group's customers, suppliers and staff globally and It remains unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve through 2021 and beyond, which from a commercial, regulatory and risk perspective could be significantly different to past crises and persist for a prolonged period. Impacts on the Group could include reduced profitability (from lower income and higher expected credit loss (ECL) charges) as well as the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the management of (among other things) Operational risk.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Legal proceedings, competition, regulatory and conduct matters giving rise to the potential risk of fines, loss of regulatory licences and permissions and other sanctions, as well as potential adverse impacts on our reputation with clients and customers and on investor confidence and/or potentially resulting in impacts on capital, liquidity and funding.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Embedding climate risk into the Group's risk framework in line with regulatory expectations, and adapting the Group's operations and business strategy to address both the financial risks resulting from: (i) the physical risk of climate change; and (ii) the risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Evolving Operational risks (notably cybersecurity, technology and resilience) and the ability to respond to the new and emerging technologies in a controlled fashion.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Sudden shocks or geopolitical unrest in any of the major economies in which the Group operates which could impact credit ratings, alter the behaviour of depositors and other counterparties and affect the ability of the firm to maintain appropriate capital and liquidity ratios.\n\nAs a universal bank with a diversified and connected portfolio of businesses, servicing customers and clients globally, the Group is impacted in the longer term by a wide range of macroeconomic, political, regulatory and accounting, technological, social and environmental developments. The evolving operating environment presents opportunities and risks which we continue to evaluate and take steps to appropriately adapt our strategy and its delivery.\n\n## Stress tests\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in which scientific progress is limited, with no vaccine available through 2021\n\nThe Board has also considered the Group's viability under specific internal stress scenarios. The latest macroeconomic internal stress test, conducted in Q4 2020, considered the potential impacts of:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the UK exiting from the EU Withdrawal Agreement on WTO terms\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 increasing EU sovereign risk due to increases in budget deficits.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 US political and social tensions and worsening US-China trade relations with escalating tariffs\n\nAll of the above could result in, among other things, a loss of income or increased impairment. The stress test outcome for macroeconomic tests shows our full financial performance over the horizon of the scenario and focuses on the CET1 capital ratio.\n\nIn addition, Barclays conducted a Group-wide, exploratory stress test against a severe but plausible climate scenario, testing vulnerability to disorderly transition risks and elevated physical risks. The aim of the analysis was to identify key vulnerabilities that were most relevant and material to the Group's business model and geographical footprint.\n\nThe Group-wide stress testing framework also includes reverse stress testing techniques which aim to identify and analyse the circumstances under which the Group's business model would no longer be viable. Examples include extreme macroeconomic downturn scenarios, or specific idiosyncratic events, covering Operational risk (for example, cyber-attacks), adverse outcomes in legal proceedings, competition, regulatory and conduct matters and capital/liquidity events.\n\nBased on current forecasts, incorporating key known regulatory changes to be enacted and having considered possible stress scenarios, the current liquidity and capital position of the Group continues to support the Board's assessment of the Group's viability.\n\nLegal proceedings, competition, regulatory and remediation/redress conduct matters are also assessed as part of the stress testing process. Capital and Liquidity Risk Appetite are set at a level designed to enable the Group to withstand various stress scenarios. As part of this process, management also identified actions, including cost reductions and withdrawal from lines of business, available to restore the Group to its desired capital flight path. These internal stress tests informed the conclusions of the WCR.",

We will keep the considerable benefits of shareholder engagement in the AGM at the forefront of our planning for the 2021 AGM.

If you hold more than 2,500 shares, please contact Equiniti for details of how to change your payment instruction.\n\nBarclays has decided to cease to offer the scrip dividend programme and will no longer offer a scrip alternative for dividends. For those shareholders who wish to elect to use their cash dividends to purchase additional ordinary shares in the market, rather than receive a cash payment, Barclays has arranged for its registrar, Equiniti, to provide and administer a dividend re-investment plan (DRIP).\n\n## Dividend Re-investment Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details regarding the DRIP can be found at home.barclays/dividends and www.shareview.co.uk/info/drip\n\n## Managing your shares online\n\nBarclays shareholders can go online to manage their shareholding and find out about Barclays performance by joining Shareview.

Since 2015, we have returned approximately \u00a34.2m to our shareholders.\n\n## Returning funds to shareholders\n\n## Donations to charity\n\nWe launched a Share Dealing Service in October 2017 aimed at shareholders with relatively small shareholdings for whom it might otherwise be uneconomical to deal. One option open to shareholders was to donate their sale proceeds to ShareGift. As a result of this initiative, the total donated to ShareGift since 2015 is over \u00a3461,267.\n\n## Key dates\n\n## 1 April 2021\n\nFull year dividend payment date\n\n## 30 April 2021\n\nAnnouncement\n\nQ1 Results\n\n## 5 May 2021\n\nat 11.00am\n\nAnnual General Meeting",

Julia's appointment reflects our commitment to strengthening our Board through the addition of further highly respected individuals with strong financial services expertise. She will bring significant corporate finance, tax and accounting experience to the Board and we look forward to welcoming her ahead of our AGM.\n\nIn line with the Group's plans for orderly succession, Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down as a Non-Executive Director and Chair of BBUKPLC on 31 December 2020 and was succeeded by Crawford Gillies with effect from 1 January 2021 (subject to regulatory approval). Crawford's track record and deep knowledge of the Group, including BBUKPLC, position him well for this role. He remains on the BPLC Board alongside\n\nAs reported in our 2019 Annual Report, Matthew Lester stepped down from the Board on 1 January 2020. Mary Anne Citrino stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2020 in order to dedicate more time to her other board commitments. We are grateful to them both for their service to Barclays.\n\nthe BBUKPLC Board and we consider the ongoing benefits of having the Chair of one of our principal subsidiaries as a member of the BPLC Board to be significant. Upon his appointment to the BBUKPLC Board, Crawford ceased to be the SID of BPLC and was succeeded in that role by Brian Gilvary with effect from 1 January 2021.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to further complement the current range of skills on the Board through the recruitment of an additional Non-Executive Director with technology experience. The benefits of increased diversity remain at the forefront of this search. We continue to believe that a Board with the right balance of skills, experience and diversity - of gender, ethnicity, cognitive and personal strengths and social backgrounds - is critical to the sustainable delivery of value to our shareholders.\n\nSir Ian has agreed to remain on the BPLC Board until the AGM in May 2021 to help ensure a smooth transition. The Board is enormously grateful to Sir Ian for the tremendous work that he has undertaken on behalf of the Group and BBUKPLC in particular. Crawford will continue to chair the Remuneration Committee until 1 March 2021, when he will be succeeded in that role by Brian Gilvary (subject to regulatory approval). At that time, Brian will have served as a member of the Remuneration Committee for 12 months as recommended by the Code. Brian also joined the Risk and Nominations Committees with effect from 1 January 2021.

While concluding that our Purpose was integrated into many of our key processes and decision-making forums, the Board was of the view that there was potential for our Purpose to be reinvigorated such that it is better connected with our stakeholders and what we do on a day-to-day basis as a bank and is deeply embedded in our decision-making.\n\nWe want to reinforce that clarity and conviction about our Purpose and our Values, and stay true to that way of thinking about how we take action at pace. Accordingly, during 2020, the Board approved the introduction of a new, extended narrative of the Group's Purpose and the refreshed descriptions of our Values to make sure they are still relevant for the challenges ahead.\n\nOur reinvigorated Purpose to 'deploy finance responsibly to support people and businesses, acting with empathy and integrity, championing innovation and sustainability, for the common\n\n' The last 12 months have been immensely challenging for the firm and our colleagues, but they have also shown Barclays at its best: who we are, what we stand for, and how quickly we can move to get things done.\n\ngood and the long term' is intended to serve as an expression of purpose which encapsulates our position as a universal bank providing global financial services and resonates with colleagues and all of our stakeholders.\n\nWe believe that positive culture, supported by effective leadership and a consistent 'tone from the top', is crucial to our success. As such, culture remains a core focus for the Board and it is reviewed in a number of ways including:\n\nWe updated and refreshed the language in the descriptors for each Value to better reflect who we are today, modern societal expectations, and things we should explicitly prioritise - such as inclusion and sustainability. Our Values remain core to how we individually 'show up' in the organisation; they are our moral compass and will continue to be used as a mandatory measure of individual performance.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 analysis of colleague survey results, reviewing and discussing colleague sentiment and feedback on areas including colleague wellbeing and engagement\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 review of our people policies, which are designed to provide equal opportunities and create an inclusive culture, in line with our Values and in support of our long-term success.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 direct engagement with colleagues locally to hear their views through channels such as town hall meetings, talent sessions and office visits\n\nThe Board reviewed Barclays' method of workforce engagement during 2020 and concluded that it had been effective, with many direct engagement mechanisms moving to digital channels. Our workforce policies and practices were also reviewed and the Board agreed they were consistent with our Values and supported the long-term sustainable success of the Group. Feedback from our colleagues indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic had accentuated many aspects of our culture, manifesting itself in improved execution speeds, higher levels of colleague engagement and a belief among a majority of colleagues that our culture had improved. The Board has also carefully reviewed and endorsed how we define the way in which we want to get things done at Barclays - what we will call our mindset: 'Empower. Challenge. Drive.'\n\nAlongside our strategy, and our strong commercial positioning, our Purpose, Values and Mindset will provide the foundations to move to the next phase of our cultural and commercial journey, supporting us in fulfilling our obligations to our shareholders, colleagues, customers, clients and wider society, in the spirit of the common good.\n\nThe current COVID-19 related challenges are unprecedented in nature and, as the Board has discussed at length, the macroeconomic environment brings a significant degree of uncertainty. This has far-reaching impacts across the Group, raising significant matters for consideration by the Board in the context of the Board's responsibility for the long-term sustainable success of Barclays, generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society, as well as for the culture of the Group more broadly. It has also required the Board to focus on how best to try to protect the health and wellbeing of colleagues and customers and, particularly in the context of the AGM arrangements, that of shareholders as well. Updates presented to the Board through the pandemic have reported on a range of stakeholder interests including matters which are key to the Group's reputation, such as business model impacts, colleague considerations, support for customers, clients and the communities in which Barclays operates, engagement with regulators, and the Group's support for customers and communities through the pandemic. You can find further details of this in our Section 172 Statement on pages 18 to 21.\n\n## How the Board thinks about strategy\n\nTo clearly establish and implement the Group's strategy, and be effective, with management, in addressing the challenges arising from the pandemic, the Board has continued to deepen its understanding of the Group's business and the risks and opportunities it faces. As such, a prioritised series of 'deep dives' forms an important part of each Board meeting, enabling the Board to spend a good proportion of its time considering longer-term and strategic issues and the Group's operational resilience, with strategy considered at every Board meeting, rather than in a set piece event once a year.

The approval of the Group's Medium Term Plan (MTP), in which our strategy is embedded, was reviewed by the Board at its September, November and December meetings.\n\nDeep dive topics discussed by the Board during the year covered a wide range of topics, including our Purpose and Values, the Group's operational mindset during the COVID-19 pandemic, the unwinding of crisis measures, and our climate change strategy, alongside updates from selected individual businesses and from key Group functions including Compliance, Legal, Risk and HR.\n\nDeep dive topics were informed by discussions with our shareholders and other stakeholders, as well as formal and informal Board discussions. In response to the growing pandemic, during 2020 our deep dives programme was kept under review to give time to the discussion of new topics flowing directly from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs in previous years, we gave considerable focus to developments in the regulatory environment, to our key correspondence with regulators during the year in the context of their annual assessments and reviews, and to our engagement with our principal regulators in the UK and the US in particular.\n\n## Governance through the pandemic\n\nThe oversight of risk profile and of our control environment is also a core Board responsibility and, in addition to the detailed oversight of these matters by the relevant Board Committees, has been addressed at Board meetings throughout the year.\n\nGiven the dynamic environment brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board needed to operate in 'crisis' mode and shift its focus from long-term value creation to addressing the short and medium-term implications of the pandemic. As part of the Board's direct oversight of matters relating to reputation, updates were presented to the Board throughout the COVID-19 pandemic reporting on a range of stakeholder interests and matters key to our reputation.\n\nYou can read more about the Board's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the difficult decision to cancel our ordinary share full year 2019 dividend, the establishment of a Board COVID-19 Response Committee and the need to revise our 2020 AGM arrangements in order to comply with UK Government guidance and to protect the health and wellbeing of our shareholders, colleagues and other stakeholders\n\nin our Section 172 Statement on pages 18 to 21.

The Board recognised that Barclays can, and should, make a real contribution to tackling climate change, and help to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: Board Audit Committee report\n\nEnsuring the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions.\n\n## Maintaining robust internal controls throughout the pandemic\n\n## Dear Fellow Shareholders\n\nThe calculation of expected credit loss (ECL) in accordance with IFRS 9 was a major focus for the Committee during the year as the calculation of credit impairment charges proved challenging due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and evolving consensus. The ECL models are based on historical relationships between macroeconomic variables and credit impairment outcomes that pre-dated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the unprecedented level of government support provided to businesses and consumers in both the UK and in the US. Given the forward-looking nature of IFRS 9 provisioning, the ECL models showed, as expected, a significant degree of sensitivity to the current economic uncertainty. While, as noted below, the Committee is satisfied that the overall ECL provision level is appropriate, it must be recognised that the profit and loss impact reflects the difference between the opening and closing stock of provisions after accounting for write-offs in the period. The lack of significant increases in the latter at present, due to government support measures, magnifies the sensitivity of the provision charge to changes in assumptions.\n\n2020 was a challenging year in terms of monitoring the internal and business controls environment alongside reviewing the Group's financial performance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTo date the impact of climate change on the Group's financial statements has been very limited. However, the Committee expects that to change over time and will continue to keep under review both this and the extent and accuracy of disclosures regarding the Group's environmental impact.\n\nIn relation to Barclays' internal control environment, the Committee noted that the Barclays Internal Control Environment Programme (BICEP) which commenced in January 2017 and was focused on strengthening the internal control environment\n\nacross the Group, successfully completed in March 2020. The Group's control environment is now in a much stronger position, which helped to deal with the operational challenges which the COVID-19 pandemic has presented. Management has operated within a robust framework for identifying and responding to control issues with appropriate reporting to the Committee and other Board Committees. The Committee was pleased to note that, effective 25 June 2020, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) announced the termination of its enforcement action initiated against Barclays Bank PLC in May 2015 with regard to business practices relating to its US FX, Rates, Commodities, Government Bonds and Credit Derivatives activities; the FRB was satisfied with the remediation actions taken by the Group to enhance its firm-wide compliance systems and controls relating to those activities. Termination of the action was contingent upon completion by the Group of a review of relevant policies and procedures, which has now been achieved.\n\nDuring 2020, I held regular meetings with the Chair of the BBUKPLC  Board Audit Committee and with the Chair of the Barclays US LLC Audit Committee. I also attended the meetings of the Barclays Bank Ireland PLC Audit Committee and BBUKPLC Audit Committee which considered the main year-end accounting issues, and I will be attending the Barclays US LLC Audit Committee meeting in March 2021. The Chair of the BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee attended the meeting of the Committee at which the control environment of BBUKPLC was considered as part of the Committee's year-end evaluation. I also\n\ncontinued to meet frequently with members of senior management, including the Group Finance Director and Chief Internal Auditor.\n\nI have also continued my regular engagement with the Group's regulators, both in the UK and US. This has encompassed not only my work as the Chair of the Committee, but also my role as the Group's Whistleblowing Champion. In that respect, I oversaw the production of the second of three annual reports which we agreed to submit to the FCA and PRA in the UK and to the New York Department of Financial Services regarding our whistleblowing programme.\n\nBarclays Internal Audit (BIA) is a key component in supporting the Committee's work. I am pleased with the way that the function has performed throughout the year, particularly in scoping, performing and reporting the outcomes of its work both to management and the Committee in an environment where the scope of its audit plan, as approved in December 2019, has had to change owing to the operational and risk challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic took hold, I spoke weekly with the Chief Internal Auditor and her key management team. A BIA Contingency Plan was established and invoked in response to the pandemic, outlining heightened management, reporting and escalation protocols for BIA, both as a Third Line of Defence and a function within the Group.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe 2020 Committee effectiveness review was conducted in accordance with the Code. This internal review involved completion of a tailored questionnaire by Committee members and standing attendees (which included our external lead audit engagement partner), in line with the approach adopted for all Board Committees in 2020. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nIn assessing general control issues for disclosure in this Annual Report, the Committee continued to apply similar concepts to those used for assessing internal financial controls for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOx). The Committee remained of the view that there are no control issues that are considered to be a material weakness and which merit specific disclosure.",

It is considered wellconstituted and provides an effective and appropriately broad level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. It was suggested that the Committee may benefit from an additional member with specialist financial reporting and management expertise, with feedback noting that this would be addressed following the appointment of Julia Wilson as a new member of the Committee when she joins the BPLC Board in April 2021. In particular, the review indicates that the Committee has continued to operate effectively in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe review commented that the Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective, noting in particular that the Committee's interaction with the Board Risk Committee works well. The review highlighted that reporting to the Committee on issues relevant to the Committee's remit relating to BBUKPLC had been streamlined and effective. Following the consolidation of the membership of the Committee with the BBPLC Board Audit Committee, coverage of BBPLC matters within concurrent meetings was considered adequate.\n\nMy role as Chair in balancing a demanding agenda efficiently so that time is allocated to the most significant items for discussion was recognised. The Committee has a broad remit and has taken on additional responsibilities during recent years, for example the oversight of tax matters, so continued focus on this area will be beneficial.\n\n## Changes to Committee composition\n\nHaving taken on the role of Chair of BBUKPLC at the end of December 2020, Crawford Gillies left the Committee. I look forward to welcoming Julia Wilson as a new member of the Committee when she joins the BPLC Board in April 2021.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe Committee will also seek to monitor the sustainability of the continuing evolution of the internal control environment, notwithstanding so many Group processes having 'returned to Satisfactory' as part of the now successfully completed BICEP initiative; and to continue the scrutiny of the control issues and new working arrangements resulting from, or associated with, the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic. We will also be looking to assess the reporting of control issues - with increasing focus on the remaining key areas of focus - as well as to monitor the satisfactory completion of various ongoing remediation programmes.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee will continue to monitor the key IFRS 9 processes, particularly in light of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, the uncertain economic environment and related impact upon the Group. There is always a balance to be struck between the sophistication of models and the ability to adapt them to changing circumstances and run them on a timely basis using different assumptions and scenarios. In implementing IFRS 9, the Group developed a number of highly complex and sophisticated models for ECL which have been particularly challenged in the pandemic, which is a situation also impacting a number of the Group's peers. Going forward, therefore, management is looking to simplify the model environment significantly, while at the same time making it more readily responsive to major changes in the economic environment. These changes will also provide increased flexibility to perform sensitivity analysis. The Committee is fully supportive of this effort and will be monitoring this development closely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mike Ashley\n\n17 February 2021\n\nChair, Board Audit Committee",

        "page_content": "## External auditor\n\n## Assessing external auditor effectiveness, objectivity and independence and non-audit services\n\nFollowing an external audit tender in 2015, KPMG was appointed as Barclays' Statutory Auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year. Michelle Hinchliffe of KPMG is Barclays' lead audit engagement partner and was appointed to this role with effect from the 2018 financial year.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee is responsible for assessing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the Group's auditor, KPMG. This responsibility was discharged throughout the year at formal Committee meetings, during private meetings with KPMG and through discussions with key Group executives. In addition to the matters noted above, the Committee also:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 discussed and agreed revisions to the Group policy on the Provision of Services by the Group Statutory Auditor (the Policy) and regularly analysed reports from management on the non-audit services provided to Barclays\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 approved the terms of the audit engagement letter and associated fees, on behalf of the Board\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 evaluated and approved revisions to the Group policy on Employment of Employees or Workers from the Statutory Auditor and ensured compliance with the policy by regularly assessing reports from management detailing any appointments made\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 assessed any potential threats to independence that were self-identified and reported by KPMG\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 was briefed by KPMG on critical accounting judgements and estimates and internal controls over financial reporting\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 considered and discussed the audit quality inspection report on KPMG issued by the FRC's Audit Quality Review (AQR) team in relation to its review of KPMG's audit of the financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2018.\n\nAs well as receiving the AQR team's formal report the Committee benefited, as on a previous occasion, from a presentation by the AQR team which was greatly appreciated. This presentation, which was also attended by the Chair of the BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee, allowed the Committee to discuss the main findings of the AQR in some detail. As foreshadowed last year, the AQR team had identified certain areas for improvement in KPMG's audit work, particularly in relation to the depth of substantive testing of financial derivative instruments and both controls and substantive work in relation to ECL estimates under IFRS 9. Again, as noted last year, KPMG had already increased its coverage of these areas both in the 2019 audit and in planning for its 2020 audit. It became apparent, however, during the Committee's discussions with the AQR team and subsequent interaction with KPMG, that the expectations continue to evolve particularly in relation to the substantive testing of IFRS ECL models, requiring some element of code review and reperformance of nearly all of the Group's models by KPMG. The Committee acknowledges that the level of audit work required is a matter of auditor judgement and more work can always be carried out, and the AQR team's comments can be helpful in this respect. However, we do have some concern over the level of incremental audit evidence obtained from these procedures, particularly in the current year when the models themselves are more than usually supportive of the judgement necessarily exercised by management, rather than determinative of the level of impairment provision required. We are also conscious of the need to balance the sufficiency of audit evidence needed with the time required, by both auditors and the Group's own employees, to execute on this expanded level of work. The Committee encouraged KPMG to continue its dialogue with the AQR team on addressing the feedback and to amend its approach to the audit work as required, but at the same time to seek to arrive at a more general consensus with both the other major firms and audit regulators on an appropriate approach for the future.\n\nKPMG's performance, independence and objectivity during 2020 were also formally assessed at the beginning of 2021 by way of a questionnaire completed by key stakeholders across the Group, including the chairs of the Board Audit Committees of the Group's main operating companies (BBUKPLC, Barclays US LLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC). The questionnaire was designed to evaluate KPMG's audit process and addressed matters such as the quality of planning and communication, technical knowledge, the level of scrutiny and challenge applied and KPMG's understanding of the business, as well as key issues relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition, as in the prior year, KPMG nominated a senior partner of the audit team reporting to the lead audit engagement partner to have specific responsibility for ensuring audit quality. The Committee therefore met with the partner concerned, without the lead audit engagement partner present, to receive a report on his assessment of audit quality bearing in mind particularly the comments received from the AQR team.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nTaking into account the result of all of the above, the Committee considered that KPMG maintained its independence and objectivity and that the audit process was effective.\n\nIn order to safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, Barclays has in place a policy setting out the circumstances in which the auditor may be engaged to provide services other than those covered by the Group audit. The Policy applies to all Barclays subsidiaries and other material entities over which Barclays has significant influence. The core principle of the Policy is that non-audit services (other than those legally required to be carried out by the Group's auditor) should be performed by the auditor only in certain controlled circumstances. The Policy sets out those types of services that are permitted ('Permitted' services). A summary of the Policy can be found at home.barclays/ who-we-are/our-governance/auditorindependence.\n\nThe Policy is aligned both with the FRC's requirements and with KPMG's own internal policy on non-audit services for FTSE 350 companies which broadly restricts non-audit work to services that are 'closely related' to the audit. The Committee approved an updated Policy in 2020 which reflected the revised FRC Ethical Standard 'white list' of permitted non-audit/additional services.\n\nThe Policy is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that it reflects applicable rules and guidelines.\n\nAny changes to the Policy are approved at a Group level by the Committee. This is in accordance with laws applicable in the UK and FRC guidance, pursuant to which audit committees of Public Interest Entities (such as Barclays) are required to approve non-audit services provided by their auditors to such entities; and subsidiary Public Interest Entities in the UK - such as BBUKPLC and BBPLC can rely on the approval of non-audit services by the ultimate parent's Board Audit Committee. Pursuant to the Policy, audit services and the fee cap are monitored by the relevant Board Audit Committee, as appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: Board Audit Committee report continued\n\nUnder the Policy, except for specific categories of 'Permitted' services that require explicit Committee approval, the Committee has pre-approved all 'Permitted' services for which fees are less than \u00a3100,000. However, all proposed work, regardless of the amount of the fees, must be sponsored by a senior executive and recorded on a centralised online system, with a detailed explanation of the clear commercial benefit arising from engaging the auditor over other potential service providers. The lead audit engagement partner must also confirm that the engagement has been approved in accordance with the auditor's own internal ethical standards and does not pose any threat to the auditor's independence or objectivity. All requests to engage the auditor are assessed by independent management (who are not involved in any work to which the proposed engagement relates) before work can commence. Requests for 'Permitted' service types in respect of which the fees are expected to meet or exceed the above threshold but expected to be less than \u00a3250,000 must be approved by the Chair of the Committee before work is permitted to begin. Services where the fees are expected to be \u00a3250,000 or higher must be approved by the Committee as a whole. All expenses and disbursements must be included in the fees calculation.\n\nFor the purposes of the Policy, the Committee has determined that any pre-approved service of a value of under \u00a350,000 is to be regarded as trivial in terms of its impact on Barclays' financial statements and has required the Group Financial Controller to specifically review and confirm to the Committee that any pre-approved service with a value of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000 may be regarded as such. The Committee undertook a review of pre-approved services at its meeting in December 2020.\n\nDuring 2020, all engagements for which expected fees met or exceeded the above thresholds were evaluated by either the Committee Chair or the Committee members as a whole, who, before confirming any approval, assured themselves that there was justifiable reason for engaging the auditor and that its independence and objectivity would not be threatened. No requests to use KPMG were declined by the Committee in 2020 (2019: none). On a quarterly basis, the Committee scrutinised details of individually approved and pre-approved services undertaken by KPMG in order to satisfy itself that they posed no risk to independence, either in isolation or on an aggregated basis.\n\nThe fees payable to KPMG for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to \u00a359m (2019: \u00a356m), of which \u00a312m (2019: \u00a311m) was payable in respect of non-audit services. A breakdown of the fees payable to the auditor for statutory audit and non-audit work can be found in Note 40 of the financial statements. Of the \u00a312m of non-audit services provided by KPMG during 2020, the significant categories of engagement, i.e. services where the fees amounted to more than \u00a3500,000, included:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 audit related services: services in connection with regulatory, compliance and internal control reports and audit procedures, required by law or regulation to be provided by the Statutory Auditor\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 audit related services: services in connection with Client Assets Sourcebook (CASS) audits (while the CASS audit fell within the auditor's scope of services, the fees for such services did not form part of the global fee arrangements and therefore required separate Committee approval pursuant to the Policy)\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 other attest and assurance services: ongoing attestation and assurance services for treasury and capital markets transactions to meet regulatory requirements, including regular reporting obligations and verification reports.\n\nAn external audit tender was conducted in 2015 and the decision was made to appoint KPMG as Barclays' external auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year, with PwC resigning as the Group's statutory auditor at the conclusion of the 2016 audit.\n\n## The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014\n\nBarclays is in compliance with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services.\n\nProvided that KPMG continues to maintain its independence and objectivity, and the Committee remains satisfied with its performance, the Group has no intention of tendering for an alternative external auditor before the end of the current required period of 10 years.\n\n' 2020 was a challenging year in terms of monitoring the internal and business controls environment alongside reviewing the Group's financial performance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: Board Nominations Committee report continued\n\n## Changes to the Board in 2020\n\nAs reported in our 2019 Annual Report, Matthew Lester stepped down from the Board on 1 January 2020. Mary Anne Citrino stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2020.\n\nWe welcomed two new Non-Executive Directors to the Board in 2020 - Mohamed A. El-Erian (appointed 1 January 2020) and Brian Gilvary (appointed 1 February 2020). Their respective skills and experience are set out in their biographies on pages 60 to 63. The Board was also very pleased to announce that Julia Wilson (currently the Finance Director of 3i Group PLC and Senior Independent Director of Legal & General Group PLC) will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director and a member of the Board Audit Committee with effect from 1 April 2021. Julia will be retiring as Senior Independent Director of Legal & General Group PLC in March 2021, before taking up her role on the Board. Julia's appointment reflects Barclays' commitment to strengthening the Board through the addition of further highly respected individuals with strong financial services expertise.\n\nFurther details regarding changes to our Board composition during 2020 are provided in the Directors' report on pages 65 to 70.\n\nThe appointment of Julia Wilson, effective 1 April 2021, will temporarily increase the size of the Board from 12 to 13 before it reduces to 12 following the resignation of Sir Ian Cheshire at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM. While we are keen to bring a further Director with technology experience on board, we have not yet identified a suitable candidate. We intend to carry on our search, with the primary aim of finding a candidate with sufficient board experience and the relevant skills to make a meaningful contribution to Board deliberations. We strongly believe that the Board remains effective taking into account the need to be small enough to operate in an effective, efficient and collaborative manner and the need to be large enough to have an appropriate mix of skills and diversity and to support succession planning and the additional roles and responsibilities of some of our Directors on the Boards of BBPLC, BBUKPLC, Barclays US LLC and BX.\n\n## Board composition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' Effective succession planning should take into account contingency planning\n\nAs mentioned above, the Committee is keen to complement the current range of skills on the Board with additional technology experience to enhance the Board's ability to provide informed and constructive challenge to management and therefore its effectiveness. Independent external search firm Spencer Stuart is undertaking a full search against this brief following searches previously undertaken by Egon Zehnder. Capturing the clear benefits of diversity of background and opinion is at the forefront of that search. Spencer Stuart and Egon Zehnder do not have any connection to Barclays or any of the Directors other than to assist with searches for executive and non-executive talent.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Non-Executive Director selection and appointment process in 2020, which was refreshed in 2019, and concluded that no changes were required to the current process.\n\nWorking alongside Spencer Stuart, the Committee has set rigorous criteria for the role it is seeking to fill, both in terms of experience and personal qualities, and has conducted an extensive search and selection process. The Committee continues to review the search remit and give further consideration to the desired skills and experience, in order to ensure due consideration is given to strong potential candidates. Open advertising for Board positions was not used this year.\n\n## Diversity\n\nAt the end of 2019 we had met our Board gender diversity target of 33%. Following changes in Board composition in 2020, as at 31 December 2020 the Board's gender diversity was 25%. With the appointment of Julia Wilson (effective 1 April 2021) and Sir Ian Cheshire stepping down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM, this will increase to 33%, in line with both the Board Diversity Policy and the Hampton Alexander Review target. In 2020, the Committee reviewed whether the level of the Board gender diversity target was still appropriate, given that it was set in 2018, and concluded that it should remain at 33%.\n\nWe believe that diversity at Board, ExCo and senior management level - of gender, ethnicity, cognitive and personal strengths and social backgrounds - is an essential element in maintaining a competitive advantage and effective governance, as well as mitigating the risk of 'group think'. The Board Diversity Policy, which has been adopted by the Board, confirms that the Committee will consider candidates on merit against objective criteria with due regard to the benefits of diversity when identifying suitable candidates for appointment to the Board.\n\nGroup-wide, Barclays has set a number of targets focused on creating more gender diversity in its wider workforce, including its ambition to achieve 28% female Managing Directors and Directors by the end of 2021. You can read more about gender diversity at Barclays, including data on the percentage of females at Managing Director and Director level, on Group ExCo and within ExCo direct reports and in Barclays' wider workforce in Our people and culture section on pages 33 to 34.\n\nYou can find more information on diversity and inclusion, including Barclays' Global Race at Work agenda and latest Ethnicity data within our wider workforce, in Our people and culture section on pages 33 to 37 and in our Diversity and Inclusion Report, which will be made available on our website.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, 17% of the Board was from an ethnically diverse background, meeting the recommendations contained within the Parker Review Committee Report into the Ethnic Diversity of UK Boards. Alongside the Board, the Committee continues to champion the Group's Global Race at Work agenda, designed to reinforce Barclays' zero tolerance stance on racism and improve opportunities and representation for ethnically diverse colleagues. In October, Barclays implemented a 12-point Race at Work action plan focused on opening up opportunities to attract, develop and add to our Black talent. The plan comprises a thorough set of actions, using data to set goals and measure success, and will be expanded in 2021 to include other ethnically diverse colleagues, as well as customers, clients and communities.\n\n## Succession\n\nEffective succession planning should take into account contingency planning (for any unforeseen departures or unexpected absences), medium-term planning (orderly refreshing of the Board, Committees and the ExCo) and long-term planning (looking ahead to the skills that may be required on the Board and the ExCo in the future).\n\nRobust succession planning for both the Board and the ExCo takes into account current and future business needs and ensures a good balance of skills, experience and effectiveness while recognising the benefits of diversity.\n\nA number of changes have been made this year to the composition of our ExCo in order to ensure that it continues to have the depth of skills and experience that we need to deliver our strategic ambitions. The Committee reviews and discusses all ExCo changes prior to announcement, taking into account executive succession plans, and considers all the changes to the ExCo composition during the year. You can find more information about the changes made to the composition of our ExCo on page 64.",

        "page_content": "With regard to Board succession planning, Tim Breedon will have been on the Board for nine years in November 2021 and Mike Ashley will have been on the Board for nine years in September 2022, and the Committee is giving further consideration to potential successors for their respective roles of Board Risk Committee Chair and Board Audit Committee Chair.\n\nIn accordance with its Terms of Reference available at home.barclays/who-we-are/ our-governance/board-committees, the Committee supports the Group Chairman in developing and monitoring effective induction, training and development for the Board.\n\n## Director training and development\n\nOpportunities for in-person Director training were more limited in 2020 as a result of social distancing guidance and as the Board and senior management focused on the Group's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Director training and development was supported through Board deep dives and through Risk deep dives and Function reviews described on pages 69 to 70. Risk deep dive topics covered in 2020 had a strategic focus and areas covered included Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book and the implications of a low rate environment for the Group's financial operating model.\n\nBoard induction schedules for incoming Non-Executive Directors were reviewed and refined, with sessions covering Board engagement, strategy, culture and people, finance, specific business areas, risk and controls, internal audit, governance matters and additional meetings with the business.\n\nThe Board also received an annual briefing on regulatory responsibilities, including the Senior Managers Regime and on Barclays' conduct and financial crime policies and standards.\n\n## Review of Board, Committee and individual Director effectiveness\n\nThe 2019 review outlined the following key recommendations:\n\n## Progress against 2019 Board Effectiveness Review\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 that consideration be given to facilitating deeper discussion of complex issues without significantly increasing demands on the Board's time\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 that consideration be given to increasing input to the Board from outside Barclays on a wider range of issues\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 that consideration be given to adding greater technology expertise to the Board, through greater external input or by looking to expand or adjust Board membership\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 that the Barclays' ongoing structured approach to workforce engagement should include appropriate opportunities for Board members to engage directly with employees.\n\nIn 2020, progress was planned, and in some respects made, on each of these matters, but disruption due to the demands of the pandemic has made it difficult to achieve all the progress we would have liked. For example, we experienced increased pressure on the Board's time and agendas, which often had to be revised at short notice to deal with urgent pandemicrelated matters. The effect of this was that, first, it was often not possible to achieve the extent of debate and depth of discussion that had been planned before the pandemic; secondly, the scope for accommodating external input in addition to the considerable expertise on the Board was limited and, thirdly, opportunities for Board members to increase their direct engagement with the workforce were restricted.\n\nWe are committed to building on the progress made this year and, to the extent not fully addressed, we will carry these recommendations forward to 2021 and will take action to address them with the Board as appropriate.\n\nNotwithstanding this, we continued with searches for suitably qualified and experienced non-executive directors with technology expertise, although these have not yet yielded suitable candidates. In addition, while direct physical engagement with the workforce has been restricted, Board members did undertake virtual engagement where possible throughout the year, for example by way of virtual 'town hall' meetings.\n\n## 2020 Board Effectiveness Review\n\nThe full and frank feedback of interviewees provides an important input into the further development of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, in particular in identifying areas in which the Board could be more effective. This feedback is shared with the Chairman and the other members of the Board by reference to the key themes and recommendations that have been identified.\n\nThe 2020 Board effectiveness review was conducted internally, in line with the Code, and was led by the Group Company Secretary, overseen by the SID. The review followed a structured interview process with Board members, senior management and other stakeholders, including our auditors.\n\nFeedback from this review indicated that the composition of the Board is considered to be strong, with the latest additions to the Board, Brian Gilvary, Dawn Fitzpatrick and Mohamed El-Erian each having settled in well, contributing meaningfully to the quality of discussion. Board members commented particularly favourably on the 'tone from the top' set by the Chairman and the other members of the Board, the strength and diversity of views of Board members contributing to a complete absence of 'group think' in discussions, the inclusive style of the Chairman and the healthy relationship developed with management.\n\n' Director training and development was supported through Board deep dives\n\nChallenge by the Board was considered to be strong yet constructive and collegiate.\n\n## 2020 Board Effectiveness Review: Recommendations\n\nThe Board is considered to have performed well through the pandemic, with the establishment of a COVID-19 Crisis Response Committee and its very regular cadence of meetings having enabled the Board to exercise close and effective oversight of the bank's role in supporting customers, clients and colleagues while remaining secure and resilient, both operationally and financially, in a rapidly evolving and dynamic environment.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The inevitable challenges of conducting Board meetings virtually and being unable to get together in person made it more challenging for the recently appointed Non-Executive Directors, in particular, and the Board as a whole, to build and deepen relationships both with each other and with management to the extent they would have liked. This was also perceived to have made it more difficult for those more recently appointed Directors to quickly gain an in-depth understanding of the bank and the key challenges facing it than would have been the case had travel and physical meetings been possible to a greater extent than they were in the last year. Consideration will be given to how best to address this both while the pandemic-related restrictions continue and once a degree of normalcy has been restored.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 While good progress has been made in holding more in-depth discussions at the Board on strategic matters, significant disruption to the Board's agenda and increased pressure on the Board's time due to the pandemic has meant that not all deep dive topics have benefited from as much debate and discussion as would have been optimal. This is being addressed in 2021 by scheduling fewer deep dives and allocating more time to each of them.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: Board Nominations Committee report continued\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Once pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted, consideration should be given to providing more opportunities for Board members to visit parts of the business in person in order both to gain a broader understanding of the business and to help facilitate direct engagement with the workforce in those locations.\n\nThe review concluded that the Board operated effectively throughout 2020, and continues to do so.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 There would be benefit in working with management to access opportunities to learn from, and to escalate more quickly, the insights gained from the handling of past issues and the reviews conducted of the root causes, and to embed those learnings into the business.\n\n## Review of Nominations Committee effectiveness\n\nThe results confirm that the Committee is operating effectively. This year's review highlights that the Committee continues to be well constituted and that the role and responsibilities of the Committee are clear and well understood. The Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective. This year's review noted that the Committee continued to operate effectively in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe 2020 Committee effectiveness review was conducted in accordance with the Code. This internal review involved completion of a tailored questionnaire by Committee members and senior management, in line with the approach adopted for all Board Committees in 2020. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nThe review noted that the Committee may benefit from a more formalised meeting schedule. Due to the nature of the Committee's roles and responsibilities this may not always be possible, but further consideration will be given to this during the year.\n\nIn response to a request to provide feedback on interaction with subsidiary committees, the review noted that the Committee's interaction with the BBUKPLC Board Nominations Committee had been effective. Following the consolidation of the membership of the Committee with the BBPLC Board Nominations Committee coverage of BBPLC within concurrent meetings was considered effective.\n\n## Review of the effectiveness of the other Committees\n\nFollowing consideration of the findings of the 2020 Board and Board Committee effectiveness reviews, the Committee remains satisfied that the Board and each of the Board Committees are operating effectively.\n\nIn addition to reviewing its own effectiveness, the Committee also reviewed the outcomes of the effectiveness reviews conducted by the Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees, which had also been conducted by way of tailored questionnaire. You can read about those reviews in the individual Committee reports elsewhere in this Governance report.\n\n## Individual Director effectiveness\n\nThe reviews were conducted by the Chairman and the Chairman's review was conducted by the SID.\n\nAll Directors in office at the end of 2020 were subject to an individual effectiveness review which was conducted in early 2021. The Chairman considered each Director's individual contribution to the Board as well as any feedback received as part of the broader Board and Committee effectiveness review.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the independence of the Non-Executive Directors and, in the cases of Tim Breedon, Mike Ashley and Crawford Gillies, all of whom have served on the Board for more than six years, their independence was subjected to a more rigorous review.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, all of the current Directors of the Company, other than Sir Ian Cheshire who is stepping down from the Board at the end of the AGM, will be submitting themselves for election or re-election at the 2021 AGM to be held on 5 May 2021 and will be unanimously recommended by the Board for election or re-election as appropriate. As part of its decision in respect of Mr Staley, the Board has had regard to the conclusions it reached last year, which conclusions remain unchanged, in relation to the investigations by the PRA and the FCA, details of which were disclosed in our 2019 Annual Report and which remain ongoing.\n\nBased on these reviews, the Board accepted the view of the Committee that each Director to be proposed for re-election at the 2021 AGM continues to be effective and contributes to Barclays' long-term sustainable success.\n\n' Diversity at Board, ExCo and senior management level...is an essential element in maintaining a competitive advantage and effective governance, as well as mitigating the risk of 'group think'",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: Board Risk Committee report\n\nThe Committee continues to work with management to position the Group conservatively in response to the heightened risk environment.\n\n## Effective risk management in challenging times\n\n## Dear Fellow Shareholders\n\n## Financial risk\n\n2020 was a particularly challenging year for risk management, as the COVID-19 pandemic introduced new risks to the Group, as well as increasing the severity and correlation of those risks already being monitored and managed. During the first half of the year, the Committee focused on the emerging economic, market and operational impacts of the measures put in place by governments to slow the spread of the pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of the various extraordinary fiscal and monetary measures taken to mitigate the financial impact on companies and individuals. While the situation stabilised to some extent in the second half of the year as lockdowns proved reasonably effective in containing the virus and there were positive developments with respect to potential vaccines, the global economic, market and political situation remains difficult and the Committee continues to work with management to position the Group conservatively in response to the heightened risk environment.\n\nThe Committee monitored developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic closely, including transmission of the virus and associated operational and economic impacts. The mandatory lockdown measures imposed by governments globally resulted in sudden and severe GDP contractions in most major economies. However, government support measures and significant central bank policy easing acted to soften the negative effects to a degree.\n\nThe Committee concentrated initially on the capital and liquidity stress on the Group, as precautionary drawing by clients on revolving credit facilities reduced cash holdings and inflated risk-weighted assets, which were also being pushed higher by general market volatility. As the stress continued, focus moved to assessing the short and medium-term Credit risk implications of rising unemployment and exposure to corporates in certain sectors, including, travel, leisure and consumer discretionary. Credit risk positioning was already conservative before the pandemic took hold, so the Committee reviewed any additional\n\nactions taken by management, comparing them with those envisaged under previous stress test scenarios. The economic shock also triggered a requirement to refresh the Group's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) and this exercise confirmed that the Bank continued to operate within its risk appetite.\n\nIn response to the economic and market impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks materially eased monetary policy, including cutting interest rates to record lows. This supported asset markets but increased margin pressure on banks resulting from very low or negative interest rates, while also presenting operational challenges. The Committee has reviewed the impact of low or negative interest rates on the Group on a number of occasions in recent years and impressed upon management the need to be prepared both operationally and financially for such an eventuality. Policy tools available to central banks to deal with further economic weakness have been limited; and the abundance of liquidity has influenced risk-pricing in financial markets. These factors have contributed to the potential for extreme market moves to occur. These risks have been actively managed by the Group's Risk function, and the Committee has maintained regular oversight of the overall risk profile of the Group's balance sheet and actions taken.\n\nThe Committee continued to review the performance of the UK and US consumer credit exposure portfolios and the impact which government support schemes and other support measures from central banks and regulators have had on these exposures. While performance has remained robust, the Committee noted the risk of rising delinquencies and further credit impairment as support schemes expire.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed geopolitical risks, in particular deteriorating relations between the US and China. These risks present a threat to global growth recovery efforts.\n\nUK risks remained a focus for the Committee due to the economic uncertainty arising as the UK formally left the EU at the end of January 2020 and the transition period began. As negotiations regarding the future trading relationship with the EU remained ongoing throughout most of the year leading up to the eventual conclusion of the free trade agreement just before the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the Committee focused on the operational resilience of the Group in the face of the risk of the macroeconomic impact of a failure to negotiate such an agreement.\n\nThe Committee continues to manage Conduct risk following the dissolution of the Board Reputation Committee in 2019. In addition to focusing on the Conduct risk profile of the Group's core businesses, the Committee has identified a number of key conduct themes requiring active management.\n\nDuring the year the Committee monitored developments in Oil & Gas markets, notably the severe stress in Q2 2020. The Committee reviewed in detail exposures in the Oil & Gas portfolio and potential losses from a sustained price stress.\n\nNotable among these is the risk that, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid introduction of new products (such as Bounce Back Loans in the UK) or changes to existing products and practices (such as the granting of payment holidays) will be reviewed subsequently and found by regulators or other stakeholders to be inadequate in some way. The Committee has encouraged management to maintain focus on the Group's established Conduct risk controls to minimise this risk, despite the rapidly changing environment.\n\nFinally, the Committee reviewed the significant enhancements the Group has made in its approach to the management of Climate change risk. The climate change stress test, which was first executed in 2019, was further developed in 2020 with enhancements to several climate change stress approaches. This exercise will support the Group's response to the forthcoming Bank of England (BoE) industry-wide stress test.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: Board Risk Committee report continued\n\n## Operational risk\n\nDuring the year, the Committee continued to monitor and challenge the progress being made in the identification, assessment and management of Operational risk. Two complementary risk management tools used by management are the Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs) and Structured Scenario Assessments (SSAs).\n\nOperational risk was heightened in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in particular, the Committee considered closely operational resilience, as the workforce largely switched to remote working. The operation of contact centres was particularly impacted by mandatory lockdown measures. The Committee focused, in particular, on efforts to restore capacity in call centres in order to support customers in financial difficulty.\n\nThe RCSAs give 'day-to-day' coverage of the risk and control environment of the Group. They are built on a foundation of the actual processes the Group employs and the risks it faces from its activities. This approach enables management to improve identification and management of Operational risks going forward and also to review in detail risk events that have occurred in order to identify root causes.\n\n## Risk appetite and risk models\n\nThe SSAs are used to evaluate Operational risk arising from more extreme but plausible situations and so complement the RCSA approach; in combination they enable the Committee to oversee the risk the Group faces at both ends of the risk likelihood spectrum. The SSAs are also an important input to the Group's Operational risk stress testing and capital frameworks. During the course of the year the Committee's SSA focus was on reviewing the specific risk scenario of data privacy and misuse (a Conduct risk theme).\n\nOne of the most important roles of the Committee is to recommend to the Board an appropriate risk appetite for the Group. This represents the amount of risk the Group is able to take to earn an appropriate return while meeting minimum internal and regulatory capital requirements in a severe but plausible stress environment. The Committee analyses Barclays performance in both its internally generated stress tests and those run externally by such bodies as the BoE, the European Banking Authority and the FRB and, following such analysis, will recommend adjustments to the Group's overall risk profile.\n\nFor the Group's internal stress test, the Committee received a detailed briefing on the process being applied and was satisfied that the internally generated scenario was appropriately calibrated, and stressed particular vulnerabilities\n\nof the Group. The Committee was further satisfied that the Group would meet internal and regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity in such a scenario.\n\n## Risk function\n\nThe Committee continued to oversee the improvement of model risk management in the Group and the ongoing validation of the Group's models, with specific progress and methodology enhancements in the model outputs supporting the Group's stress tests, including the ICAAP and ILAAP. The Group's models are the core foundation upon which the majority of its internal assessment processes run. The Committee is pleased to report that progress has continued during 2020 to embed the Model risk management framework as evidenced by an increasingly stable model inventory and further improvements in documentation and control. However, models remain a key risk area for the Group and the Committee is closely monitoring the development of the Group's approach while noting that the extreme market and economic conditions experienced during 2020 will have affected the performance of many of the existing models in use.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the Risk function, whose primary role is the oversight and challenge of risk taking as the Second Line of Defence. It accomplishes this by establishing the policies, limits, rules and constraints under which first line activities shall be performed, consistent with the Group's risk appetite and through monitoring the performance of the first line of defence against these policies, limits and constraints. The Committee's responsibilities include designing a consistent classification of the risks faced by the Group in order to organise their management and reporting; designing and operating the process of setting risk appetite and material limits for the Group as a whole and its main entities; setting or approving strategies for approvals of transactions, and indeed approving significant individual agreements; and establishing key controls requirements to which customer-facing areas of Barclays must adhere in the conduct of their businesses.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Risk function's own assessment of its capability in late 2020 which showed that the function continues to meet expectations in providing effective and independent oversight with strong stewardship and technical competency. The Committee also oversaw a number of changes to the senior management of the Risk function, including and consequent upon the appointment of the Group's new Chief Risk Officer, Taalib Shaah. It was encouraging that these changes were achieved through internal succession, supporting the stability of the function.\n\n## Compliance function\n\nThe Committee monitored the delivery of the Compliance function's Annual Plan for 2020 and approved the Compliance Annual Plan for 2021.\n\nThe purpose of the Compliance function is to provide oversight of Conduct risk management practices as part of Barclays' second line of defence. Compliance participates in the prevention, detection and management of breaches of applicable laws, rules, regulations and relevant procedures and has a key role in helping to strengthen the culture of Barclays and achieve the right conduct outcomes. The Committee supports the independence of the Compliance function from the operational functions so that it has sufficient authority, stature, resources and access to the management body.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe results of the review were positive and indicated that the Committee is operating effectively; and that it is well constituted and provides an effective and broad level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. The Committee was considered to be both challenging and influential, providing strong support to the new Group Chief Risk Officer. The review noted that the Committee has a broad remit having taken on oversight of Conduct and Compliance matters in 2019 following the disbanding of the Reputation Committee and that a continued focus on these areas was considered to be beneficial. The review concluded that the Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective.\n\nThe 2020 Committee effectiveness review was conducted in accordance with the Code. This internal review involved completion of a tailored questionnaire by Committee members and senior management, in line with the approach adopted for all Board Committees in 2020. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nFollowing the consolidation of the membership of the Committee with the BBPLC Risk Committee, coverage of BBPLC matters within concurrent meetings was considered appropriate. In particular, this year's review noted that the Committee continued to operate effectively in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and that recent appointments to the Committee had strengthened its depth of experience.",

Like so many others, I lost friends and family due to COVID-19 and suffered from the anxiety that came from the pandemic and the various lockdowns.\n\nAs a result, we have become closer as a team and created a balance that has helped us, our families, and our customers cope better with some of the issues we've faced.\n\nMy managers at Barclays were generous in giving me time and support when I needed it most. So, it was important for me to ensure the team I oversaw felt the same sense of commitment and care. We benefited from the creation of an online wellbeing portal with a growing store of practical resources, and a variety of hands-on virtual events that allowed us to share personal stories and advice. The Barclays Cycling Club was also a real help. We had a number of virtual rides that helped me spend time by myself uninterrupted.\n\nIt was important to ensure my team felt the same sense of commitment and care.\n\nPush Gumaste Global Head of International Corporates, Corporate Banking London\n\nBarclays PLC Annual Report 2020\n\n<!-- image -->",

Barclays PLC is reporting against the requirements of the latest version of the Code in this Annual Report, which was published in 2018.\n\nA copy of the Code can be found at frc.org.uk. For the year ended 31 December 2020, and as at the date of this report, we are pleased to confirm that Barclays PLC has complied in full with the Code's principles and provisions.\n\n## Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules\n\nBy virtue of the information included in this Governance section of the Annual Report, we comply with the corporate governance statement requirements of the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. Certain additional information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to DTR7.2.6 can be found on pages 102 to 104.\n\n## New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n\nBarclays is permitted by NYSE rules to follow UK corporate governance practices instead of those applied in the US. However, any significant variations must be explained in Barclays' Form 20-F filing, which can be accessed from the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR database or on our website, home.barclays.\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose\n\nAs highlighted earlier in this report, our governance is structured to deliver an effective and entrepreneurial Board which:\n\n## Role of the Board\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 is effective in providing challenge, advice and support to management\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 drives informed, collaborative and accountable decision-making\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 provides checks and balances and encourages constructive challenge\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 creates long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, having regard to our other stakeholders.\n\nThe Barclays Way sets the framework for achieving a dynamic and positive culture. The Board supports The Barclays Way and the Barclays Purpose and Values. It promotes personal accountability and leadership and monitors our culture to satisfy itself as to the alignment of Barclays' culture to its Purpose, Values and strategy. See page 146 for more details.\n\n## Culture\n\nOur whistleblowing policy enables employees to raise any matters of concern anonymously and is embedded into our business. For more detail please refer to page 78 of the Board Audit Committee report.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of listening to, and understanding the views of stakeholders in order to inform the Board's decision-making. You can read more about how we engage with our stakeholders, including what they told us in 2020 and how we responded, including in relation to the Group's climate change strategy and responding to challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, in our Strategic report on pages 16 to 21.\n\n## Relations with shareholders and stakeholders\n\nOur comprehensive Investor Relations engagement helps the Board to understand investor views about Barclays, which are communicated regularly to the Board; and our Group Chairman engages with shareholders on\n\ngovernance and related matters. Our Investor Relations programme was adjusted to a virtual format for 2020 which ensured we enjoyed a high level of activity with existing and target investors despite restrictions on face to face meetings.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nOur shareholder communication guidelines are available on our website at home.barclays/ investorrelations.\n\nIn 2020, the Directors, in conjunction with the senior executive team and Investor Relations colleagues, participated in a number of virtual investor meetings, seminars and conferences across many locations, given 'in-person' meetings were limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We held conference calls/webcasts for our quarterly results briefings and an in-person presentation of our 2019 full year results for both our equity and fixed income investors.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 credit conditions and our ability to manage risk appropriately through the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDuring 2020, discussions with investors included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the impact of low interest rates and reduced levels of consumer spending on our income generation\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Barclays' commitment to tackling climate change.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 regulatory restriction on dividends across all UK banks, to allow continued support for the economy\n\n## Private shareholders\n\nDuring 2020, we continued to communicate with our private shareholders through shareholder mailings and through the information available on our website and through our AGM. Although shareholders were unable to attend in person due the COVID-19 pandemic, shareholders were able to submit questions ahead of the AGM and all questions were responded to individually and answers to frequently asked questions were published on our website. Shareholders can also choose to sign up to Shareview so that they receive information about Barclays PLC and their shareholding directly by email.

        "page_content": "Rights Issue in September 2013, and offered a Share Dealing Service aimed at shareholders with relatively small shareholdings for whom it might otherwise be uneconomical to deal in Barclays shares. For more detail, please see pages 54 to 55.\n\nThe Board was disappointed that the 2020 AGM was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and shareholders were unable to attend in person. The Board and the senior executive team consider our AGM to be a key opportunity for shareholder engagement, particularly with our private shareholders and for shareholders to ask questions of the Board. A number of Directors, including the Group Chairman, are normally available for informal discussion before or after an AGM. Given that shareholders were unable to attend in person, they were strongly encouraged to submit questions to the Board in advance of the meeting. All questions received were answered individually and answers to frequently asked questions were published on our website.\n\n## The 2020 AGM\n\nVoting in respect of all of the resolutions proposed by the Board at the 2020 AGM was conducted by way of a poll, thereby giving weight to the number of shares held by shareholders rather than simply attributing a notional one vote to each shareholder voting. With the exception of the shareholder requisitioned Resolution 30, all resolutions were passed with votes 'For' ranging from 90.60% to 99.93% of the total votes cast.\n\nBased on its extensive engagement with shareholders prior to the AGM, which involved discussions with shareholders holding a very significant percentage of Barclays' share capital, Barclays understands from those shareholders spoken to who voted in favour of Resolution 30 why they did so. Those shareholders represent a very large proportion of the votes cast 'For'\n\nA climate change resolution (Resolution 30) was requisitioned by a group of shareholders co-ordinated by ShareAction. The resolution was not supported by the Board, which proposed its own climate change resolution (Resolution 29) and recommended that shareholders vote in favour of Resolution 29 and not Resolution 30. After dialogue, ShareAction and many of the co-filers of Resolution 30 recommended that shareholders vote in favour of both Resolution 29 and Resolution 30. Resolution 29 (the resolution recommended by the Board) was duly passed with overwhelming shareholder support (with 99.93% of votes cast, representing 68.8% of the register, being in favour of that resolution). Resolution 30, which was not supported by the Board, was not passed, and the level of shareholder support for it fell well short of the 75% majority required for it to pass. 23.95% of the votes cast were cast 'For' Resolution 30, representing 14.35% of the register.\n\nResolution 30 and they explained to Barclays, either in writing or orally, in the course of that engagement their reasons for supporting Resolution 30. Barclays has thus gained a clear understanding of the reasons behind the voting outcome in respect of Resolution 30.\n\nOn 30 November 2020, Barclays published an update on its climate strategy, detailing the methodology it will follow, the metrics for measuring its progress and the targets against which it will report, all of which were developed with the help of a range of stakeholders. For more information on Barclays' climate strategy, please see pages 39 to 44 and the Barclays ESG Report.\n\nFollowing the 2020 AGM, to begin the process of embedding into the business the changes required by Resolution 29, the Board approved the creation of a new ExCo role focused on driving the execution and evolution of Barclays' climate strategy.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2021 AGM, the Board currently intends to hold the AGM on 5 May 2021 at 11:00am, subject to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any UK Government guidance on social distancing, non-essential travel and/or public gatherings. Guidance on whether physical attendance by shareholders will be possible will be determined nearer the time of the AGM. We will keep the considerable benefits of shareholder engagement in the AGM at the forefront of our planning for the 2021 AGM. Further details will be provided in the Notice of AGM.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nIn the future, and when circumstances permit, the Board expects to alternate AGM venues between London and a venue other than London where Barclays has a significant business or customer presence.\n\nThe Board continues to seek to understand all stakeholders' views, and the impact of our behaviour and business on customers and clients, colleagues, suppliers, communities and society more broadly. Accordingly, the Board monitors key indicators across areas such as culture, citizenship, conduct, and customer and client satisfaction on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe will publish the Barclays ESG Report at the same time as this Report, which will be made available on our website at home.barclays/ annualreport.\n\nIn 2020, we engaged extensively with shareholders and other stakeholders (including proxy advisory agencies and investor associations) on key topics including our commitment to tackle climate change and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see our Section 172 Statement on pages 18 to 21 for further information about our engagement with our four priority stakeholder groups - customers and clients, colleagues, society and investors.\n\nThroughout 2020, we have engaged with our stakeholders through a variety of means including surveys, participation in forums and global and regional industry initiatives. As a result of COVID-19, many of our events this year have been web based, although where possible we have supported key workers with site visits. This will continue in 2021, subject again to the constraints arising from the pandemic.\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\nFor further detail about how we engaged with our customers and clients, colleagues, society and investors in 2020, including what they told us and how we responded, please see our Strategic report on pages 16 to 21.\n\nThe Group has a long-standing commitment to the importance and value of colleague engagement. Our colleagues make a critical difference to our success, and our investment in them protects and strengthens our culture. In addition to our annual employee survey, in 2020 we ran regular 'Here to Listen' surveys to understand how colleagues were feeling during the COVID-19 pandemic with a specific focus on wellbeing, working remotely and work/life balance.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nYou can read more about our commitment to our colleagues and our workforce engagement, including survey results and our support of colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic, in our People and culture section on pages 33 to 37 and in our Strategic report on pages 16 to 21.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Barclays PLC Articles of Association (the Articles), the Board has the authority to authorise conflicts of interest and this ensures that the influence of third parties does not compromise the independent judgement of the Board. Directors are required to declare any potential or actual conflicts of interest that could interfere with their ability to act in the best interests of the Group.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary maintains a conflicts register, which is a record of actual and potential conflicts, together with any Board authorisation of the conflicts. The authorisations are for an indefinite period but are reviewed annually by the Nominations Committee, which also considers the effectiveness of the process for authorising Directors' conflicts of interest. The Board retains the power to vary or terminate these authorisations at any time.",

However, in line with the principles of the Code, a clear division of responsibilities has been established.\n\n## Roles on the Board\n\nThe Group Chairman is responsible for:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 demonstrating objective judgement\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 leading the Board and its overall effectiveness\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 promoting a culture of openness and constructive challenge and debate between all Directors\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 ensuring Directors receive accurate, clear and timely information.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 facilitating constructive board relations and the effective contribution of all Non-Executive Directors\n\nResponsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the Group Chief Executive Officer who is supported in this role by the ExCo. Further information on the membership of the ExCo can be found on page 64.\n\n## Attendance\n\nAs a Board we have set out our expectations of each Director in Barclays' Charter of Expectations . This includes role profiles and the behaviours and competencies required for each role on the Board, namely the Group Chairman, Group Deputy Chairman (to the extent one is required), the SID, Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors and Committee Chairs.\n\nThe SID provides a sounding board for the Group Chairman, acts as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary and is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been addressed through the normal channels.\n\nConsistent with our Charter of Expectations , the Non-Executive Directors provide effective oversight and scrutiny, strategic guidance and constructive challenge, while holding the Executive Directors to account against their agreed performance objectives. The NonExecutive Directors, led by the Nominations Committee, have primary responsibility for the appointment and removal of the Executive Directors.\n\nThe Charter of Expectations is reviewed annually to ensure it remains relevant and accurately reflects the requirements of the Code, the Regulations and industry best practice.\n\nA copy of the Charter of Expectations can be found at home.barclays/who-we-are/ our-governance/board-responsibilities\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Group Chairman to ensure that Board agendas are focused on key strategy, risk, performance and other value creation issues, and that members of the Board receive timely and high-quality information to enable them to make sound decisions and promote the success of Barclays PLC. Working in collaboration with the Group Chairman, the Group Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring good governance and information flow, to ensure an effective Board.\n\n## Information provided to the Board\n\nThroughout the year, both the Executive Directors and senior executives kept the Board informed of key business developments through regular updates. These are in addition to the presentations that the Board and Board Committees receive as part of their formal meetings. Directors are able to seek independent and professional advice at Barclays' expense, if required, to enable them to fulfil their obligations as members of the Board.\n\nDirectors are expected to attend every Board meeting. In 2020, attendance was very strong both at scheduled and additional meetings (including those called at short notice), as reflected in the table below. The Group Chairman met privately with the Non-Executive Directors on at least three occasions. If, owing to exceptional circumstances, a Director was not able to attend a Board meeting, he or she ensured that his or her views were made known to the Group Chairman in advance of the meeting. In addition, the SID met the other Non-Executive Directors individually, without the Group Chairman, to appraise the Group Chairman's performance, the details of which are included on page 86. Due to the circumstances of the pandemic, the Board met an additional six times during the course of the year. The high level of attendance at these additional meetings, many of which were scheduled at short notice, is a testament to the commitment of each of our current Directors.\n\n| Board attendance in 2020            | Independent/Executive           | Scheduled meetings  eligible to attend   | Scheduled  meetings  attended   | %  attendance   | Additional  meetings  eligible to attend   | Additional  meetings  attended   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Chairman                            |                                 |                                          |                                 |                 |                                            |                                  |\n| Nigel Higgins                       | On appointment a                | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Executive Directors                 |                                 |                                          |                                 |                 |                                            |                                  |\n| Jes Staley                          | Executive Director              | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 4                                          | 4                                |\n| Tushar Morzaria                     | Executive Director              | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 4                                          | 4                                |\n| Non-Executive Directors             |                                 |                                          |                                 |                 |                                            |                                  |\n| Mike Ashley                         | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Tim Breedon                         | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 5                                |\n| Sir Ian Cheshire                    | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Mohamed El-Erian                    | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Dawn Fitzpatrick                    | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Mary Francis                        | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Crawford Gillies                    | Senior Independent Director b c | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Brian Gilvary                       | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Diane Schueneman                    | Independent                     | 7                                        | 7                               | 100%            | 6                                          | 6                                |\n| Former Directors  Mary Anne Citrino | Independent                     | 7                                        | 5                               | 71%             | 6                                          | 5                                |\n\n- a As required by the Code, the Chairman was independent on appointment.\n- c As above.\n- b  Brian Gilvary did not succeed Crawford Gillies as Senior Independent Director until 1 January 2021.",

The Nominations Committee remains satisfied that the lengths of their tenure have no impact on their respective levels of independence or the effectiveness of their contributions. The Board considers all of the Non-Executive Directors to be independent.\n\nIn line with the requirements of the Code, a majority of the Board is comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors. Our Nominations Committee considers the independence of our Non-Executive Directors annually, having regard to the independence criteria set out in the Code. As part of this process, our Nominations Committee keeps under review the length of tenure of all Directors, which can affect independence, and makes any recommendations to the Board accordingly.\n\nDuring 2020, both Matthew Lester and Mary Anne Citrino stepped down from the Board. Neither raised any concerns about the operation of the Board or management.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nYou can read more about the changes to Board composition in 2020 and steps taken to further strengthen the Board in the report of our Nominations Committee on pages 82 to 86.\n\nAll potential new Directors are asked to disclose their other significant commitments. The Nominations Committee then takes this into account when considering a proposed appointment to ensure that Directors can discharge their responsibilities to Barclays effectively. This means not only attending and preparing for formal Board and Board Committee meetings, but also making time to understand the business and to undertake training. As stated in our Charter of Expectations , the time commitment is agreed with each Non-Executive Director on an individual basis. In addition, all Directors must seek approval before accepting any significant new commitment. Set out on this page is the average time\n\ncommitment expected for the role of NonExecutive Directors and the other NonExecutive positions on the Board.\n\n## Time Commitment\n\n| Role                         | Expected time  commitment                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Chairman                     | Equivalent to up to 80%  of full-time position.                                                                                                                                     |\n| Senior Independent  Director | As required to fulfil  the role.                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Non-Executive  Director      | 35-40 days per year  (membership of one  Board Committee  included, increasing  to 50 days a year if  member of two Board  Committees).                                             |\n| Committee Chairs             | At least 80 days per year  (including Non- Executive Director time  commitment) for Audit  and Risk Committee  Chairs and at least 60  days for the  Remuneration  Committee Chair. |\n\nWhere circumstances require it, all Directors are expected to commit additional time as necessary to their work on the Board. The Group Company Secretary maintains a record of each Director's commitments. For the year ended 31 December 2020 and as at the date of publication, the Board is satisfied that none of the Directors is over-committed and that each of the Directors allocates sufficient time to his or her role in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively.\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n## Board appointments\n\nWe have a Nominations Committee, the purpose and activities of which are contained in the Nominations Committee Report on pages 82 to 86.\n\nAll appointments to the Board and senior management are viewed through a diversity lens and are based on merit and objective criteria, which focus on the skills and experience required for the Board's effectiveness and the delivery of the Group strategy. Board appointments are made following a rigorous and transparent process facilitated by the Nominations Committee, with the aid of an external search consultancy firm. You can read more about the work of the Nominations Committee on pages 82 to 86.\n\nThe Nominations Committee regularly reviews the composition of the Board, Board Committees and the ExCo. It frequently considers the skills required for the Board, its Board Committees and the ExCo, identifying the core competencies, diversity and experience required. This, along with the annual evaluation, helps to refresh the thinking on Board, Board Committee and ExCo composition and to determine a timeline for proposed new appointments. For the Board, it is standard practice to appoint any new Non-Executive Director or Chair for an initial three-year term, subject to annual re-election at the AGM, which may be extended for up to a further three-year term. As such, Non-Executive Directors typically serve up to a total of six years.\n\nDiversity across the Group remains a key area of focus. For more detail on our actions to increase diversity please see our People and culture section on pages 33 to 37.\n\nAll Directors are subject to election or reelection each year by shareholders at the AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: How we comply continued\n\nEach year we carry out an effectiveness review in order to evaluate our performance, as a Board, as well as the performance of each of the Board Committees and individual Directors. More information on the 2020 Board evaluation and effectiveness review can be found on pages 85 to 86.\n\nThe service contracts for the Executive Directors and the letters of appointment for the Group Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at our registered office and at the AGM.\n\nOur Board members' biographies showing their relevant skills and experience, Board Committee memberships and other principal appointments can be found on pages 60 to 63. Details of changes to the Board in 2020 and up to the date of this Report are disclosed on page 65.\n\n## Induction\n\nFollowing their appointment, Mohamed A. El-Erian and Brian Gilvary have received such inductions. They have each met with the Group Company Secretary, the current Non-Executive Directors, members of the ExCo and certain other senior executives as part of that process.\n\nOn appointment to the Board, all Directors receive a comprehensive induction that is tailored to the new Director's individual requirements. The induction schedule is designed to provide the new Director with an understanding of how the Group works and the key issues that it faces. The Group Company Secretary consults the Group Chairman when designing an induction schedule giving consideration to the particular needs of a new Director. When a Director is joining a Board Committee, the schedule includes an induction to the operation of that committee.\n\n## Training and development\n\nOpportunities for Director training were more limited in 2020 as a result of social distancing guidance and as the Board and senior management focused on the Group's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, training and development was also supported through the Board deep dives, Risk deep dives and Function reviews described on pages 69 to 70. In addition, the Board received its annual briefing on regulatory responsibilities, including the Senior Managers Regime.\n\nIn order to continue to contribute effectively to Board and Board Committee meetings, Directors are regularly provided with the opportunity to take part in ongoing training and development and can also request specific training as required.\n\n## Audit, Risk and Internal Control\n\nInternal governance processes have been developed to ensure the effective operation of the individual boards and board committees of each of BPLC, BBUKPLC and BBPLC respectively, in recognition of the fact that this is key to the development and execution of the Group's strategy. Generally, there is one set of rules for the Group. Group-wide frameworks, policies and standards are adopted throughout the Group unless local laws or regulations (for example, the ring-fencing obligations applicable to BBUKPLC) require otherwise, or the ExCo decides otherwise in a particular instance.\n\n## Accountability\n\nThe Board has a Board Audit Committee and a Board Risk Committee. The purposes and activities of the Board Audit and Board Risk Committees are contained within their respective reports on pages 72 and 87 respectively.\n\nThe Board, together with the Board Audit Committee, is responsible for ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions. For this reason, the Board Audit Committee members met regularly with the Group Chief Internal Auditor and the KPMG lead audit engagement partner, without management present. The appointment and removal of the Group Chief Internal Auditor is a matter reserved to the Board Audit Committee and the appointment, and removal, of the external auditor, is a matter reserved to the Board. Neither task is delegated to management. This is explained in detail on pages 72 to 80 of the Board Audit Committee report.\n\n## Internal and external audit functions\n\n## Company's position and prospects\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board, together with the Board Audit Committee, is responsible for ensuring the integrity of this Annual Report and that the financial statements as a whole present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of our performance, position and prospects. This is explained in detail on pages 72 to 78 of the Board Audit Committee report.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for ensuring that management maintains an effective system of risk management and internal control and for assessing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to identify, evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe Group is committed to operating within a strong system of internal control. Barclays has an overarching framework that sets out the approach of the Group to internal governance, The Barclays Guide . This establishes the mechanisms, principles and processes through which management implements the strategy set by the Board.\n\n## Effectiveness of internal controls\n\nProcesses are in place for identifying, evaluating and managing the Principal Risks facing the Group in accordance with the 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting', published by the FRC. A key component of T he Barclays Guide is the ERMF. The purpose of the ERMF is to identify and set minimum requirements in respect of the main risks to the strategic objectives of the Group. There are eight Principal Risks under the ERMF: Credit risk, Market risk, Treasury and Capital risk, Operational risk, Model risk, Reputation risk, Conduct risk and Legal risk. The system of risk management and internal control is set out in the risk frameworks relating to each of our eight Principal Risks and the Barclays Control Framework, which details requirements for the delivery of control responsibilities. Group-wide frameworks, policies and standards enable Barclays to meet regulators' expectations relating to internal control and assurance.\n\nKey controls are assessed on a regular basis for both design and operating effectiveness. Issues arising out of these assessments, where appropriate, are reported to the Board Audit Committee. The Board Audit Committee oversees the control environment (and remediation of related issues) and you can read more about its work on pages 72 to 80.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee also reviews annually the risk management and internal control system, which includes the ERMF. It has concluded that, throughout the year ended 31 December 2020 and to date, the Group has operated a sound system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance of financial and operational controls and compliance with laws and regulations. For more details on that evaluation and its conclusions please see pages 72 to 80.",

        "page_content": "The review of the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control is achieved through reviewing the effectiveness of the frameworks, principles and processes contained within The Barclays Guide, the ERMF and the Barclays Control Framework.\n\nFurther details of risk management procedures and material existing and emerging risks are given in the Risk review and Risk management sections on pages 143 to 231.\n\nRegular reports are made by management to the Board Risk Committee and the Board covering significant risks, measurement methodologies and appropriate risk appetite for the Group.\n\n## Controls over financial reporting\n\nSpecific governance committees are responsible for examining the financial reports and disclosures to ensure that they have been subject to adequate verification and comply with applicable standards and legislation.\n\nA framework of disclosure controls and procedures is in place to support the approval of the financial statements of the Group.\n\nWhere appropriate, these committees report their conclusions to the Board Audit Committee, which debates such conclusions and provides further challenge. Finally, the Board scrutinises and approves results announcements and the Annual Report and ensures that appropriate disclosures have been made. This governance process ensures that both management and the Board are given sufficient opportunity to debate and challenge the financial statements of the Group and other significant disclosures before they are made public.\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements, in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU).\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nInternal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and the respective Directors\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nManagement has assessed the internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020. In making its assessment, management utilised the criteria set out in the 2013 COSO framework and concluded that, based on its assessment, the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2020.\n\nInternal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe system of internal financial and operational controls is also subject to regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. Further information on supervision by the financial services regulators is provided under Supervision and Regulation in the Risk review section on pages 232 to 238.\n\nThere have been no changes that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for the consideration and approval of the remuneration arrangements of the Group Chairman, the Executive Directors, other senior executives and certain Group employees to the Board Remuneration Committee. The Board Remuneration Committee, when considering the remuneration policies and practices, seeks to ensure that they support our strategy and promote the long-term success of the business and that they are aligned to the successful delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Company has a Board Remuneration Committee, the purpose and activities of which are described in the Board Remuneration Committee report on pages 108 to 142.\n\nAll executive and senior management remuneration policies are developed in accordance with the Group's formal and transparent procedures (ensuring that no Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration outcome) and having regard to workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture.\n\nInformation on the purpose of the Board Remuneration Committee and its activities in 2020 can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 108 to 142.\n\nAll Board Remuneration Committee members demonstrate independent judgement and discretion when determining and approving remuneration outcomes. The Board as a whole, with the Non-Executive Directors abstaining, considers annually the fees paid to NonExecutive Directors.",

The 2020 full year dividend of 1.0p per share will be paid on 1 April 2021 to shareholders whose names are on the Register of Members at the close of business on 26 February 2021. With no half year dividend paid in 2020, the total distribution for 2020 is 1.0p (2019: 3.0p) per ordinary share. As a result of the cancellation of the 2019 full year dividend in April 2020, no dividends were paid in 2020 (2019: \u00a31,201m).\n\n## Profit and dividends\n\nBarclays has decided to cease to offer the scrip dividend programme and will no longer offer a scrip alternative for dividends. For those shareholders who wish to elect to use their cash dividends to purchase additional ordinary shares in the market, rather than receive a cash payment, Barclays has arranged for its registrar, Equiniti, to provide and administer a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP). Further details regarding the DRIP can be found at www.barclays.com",

As no dividends were paid in 2020, the total amount of dividends waived during the year ended 31 December 2020 was nil (2019: \u00a31.58m).\n\nThe names of the current Directors of Barclays PLC, along with their biographical details, are set out on pages 60 to 64 and are incorporated into this Directors' report by reference. Changes to Directors during the year are set out below.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\n| Name                 | Role                    | Effective date of  appointment / resignation   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Mohamed A.

The Board has the power to appoint additional Directors or to fill a casual vacancy among the Directors and any Director so appointed holds office only until the next AGM and may offer himself/herself for re-election. The Code recommends that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual re-election. Other than Sir Ian Cheshire who is stepping down from the Board at the 2021 AGM, all Directors (including Julia Wilson who joins the Board on 1 April 2021) will stand for election or re-election at the 2021 AGM.\n\nThe appointment and retirement of Directors is governed by our Articles, the Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions (as defined by section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2020 for the benefit of the then directors, and at the date of this report are in force for the benefit of directors of Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited as trustee of the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund, Barclays Capital International Pension Scheme (No.1) and Barclays PLC Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme. The directors of the trustee are indemnified against liability incurred in connection with the trustee's activities in relation to the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund, Barclays Capital International Pension Scheme (No.1) and Barclays PLC Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme.\n\nQualifying third party indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2020 for the benefit of the then Directors and, at the date of this report, are in force for the benefit of the Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) in connection with their duties, powers or office. In addition, the Group maintains Directors' & Officers' Liability Insurance which gives appropriate cover for legal action brought against its Directors.\n\n## Political donations\n\nIn accordance with the US Federal Election Campaign Act, Barclays provides administrative support to a federal Political Action Committee (PAC) in the US, funded by the voluntary political contributions of eligible employees. The PAC is not controlled by Barclays and all decisions regarding the amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by a steering committee comprising employees eligible to contribute to the PAC. Contributions to political organisations reported by the PAC during the calendar year 2020 totalled $113,500 (2019: $46,000).\n\nThe Group did not give any money for political purposes in the UK, the EU or outside the EU, nor did it make any political donations to political parties or other political organisations or to any independent election candidates, nor did it incur any political expenditure during the year.\n\n## Country-by-Country reporting\n\n## Environment\n\nThe Capital Requirements (Country-byCountry reporting) Regulations 2013 require the Company to publish additional information in respect of the year ended 31 December 2020. This information is available on the Barclays website: home.barclays/annualreport\n\nBarclays focuses on addressing environmental issues where we believe we have the greatest potential to make a difference. As part of our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, we continue to work towards aligning our financing with the Paris Climate Agreement (see page 44) and continue to reduce our operational carbon footprint.\n\nIn line with Barclays' ambition to be a net zero bank, Barclays remains committed to managing our own operational footprint and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. In 2020, we achieved a 71% scope 1 and 2 emission reduction against our 2018 baseline, and we continue to offset our residual emissions from our operations and business travel. This reduction was principally achieved through the expansion of our renewable electricity purchasing programme across Continental Europe, United Kingdom Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the United States. Our current renewable electricity consumption currently stands at 74% against our interim target of procuring 90% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2021.\n\n## 2020 performance update\n\nWe have disclosed global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use data as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. Additional disclosures on (i) financing solutions for the lower carbon economy, (ii) environmental risk management and (iii) management of our carbon and environmental footprint are set out in our Strategic report, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report and TCFD Report, available on our website at home.barclays/annualreport",

We have adopted the operational control approach on reporting boundaries to define our reporting boundary. Where properties are covered by Barclays' consolidated financial statements but are leased to tenants and Barclays is not responsible for utility costs, these emissions are not included in the Group GHG emission calculations. Where Barclays is responsible for the utility costs, these emissions are included. We continuously review and update our performance data based on updated carbon emission factors, improvements in data quality and updates to estimates previously applied. For 2020 we have applied the latest emission factors available at the time of reporting. Where our performance has changed by more than 1% we have restated these figures. This year 2019 scope 2 emissions have been updated to reflect additional consumption data which was not available at the time of reporting and updates to residual mix factors specifically in the US which is the material contributor to the scope 2 market based emissions restatement. The previously reported figure was  110,017tCO2e (scope 2 market based) & 185,743tCO2e (location based).\n- a   The carbon reporting year for our GHG emissions is 1 October to 30 September. The carbon reporting year is not fully aligned to the financial reporting year covered by this Directors' report. Details of our approach to assurance over the data is set out in the 2020 Barclays ESG Report.\n- c   Scope 1 covers GHG emissions from activities for which the Group is responsible, including emissions from the direct combustion of fuels and the operation of facilities. In the case of company owned vehicles, emissions are limited to UK vehicles only as this is the only country in which the Group owns vehicles.\n- e   Scope 3 covers indirect emissions from business travel. Business travel for these purposes comprises of: global flights and ground transport within the UK, US and India, however in the case of the US and India ground transport covers onwards car hire only which has been provided directly by the supplier. Ground transportation data (excluding scope 1 emissions from company owned vehicles) covers only countries where robust data is available directly from the supplier.\n- d   Scope 2 covers GHG emissions from electricity, heat, cooling and steam purchased for own use. Market-based emissions have been reported for 2019 and 2020. We have used a zero emission factor where we have renewable contracts already in place in the UK, US, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Continental Europe.\n- f Intensity ratio calculations have been calculated using location-based emission factors only.\n- \u00b7   we have reduced our Group energy consumption by 8% versus 2019 as a result of reduced operating hours of our property portfolio as our global workforce transitioned to remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\ng   Energy consumption data is captured through utility billing; meter reads or estimates. Principal measures we have undertaken in 2020 to improve energy efficiency include the following:\n\n- \u00b7   we continue to work on improving the operational efficiency of our property portfolio and in 2020 conducted energy efficiency projects globally which have achieved a total energy reduction of 8GWhs since implementation. The achieved reductions can be broken down by principal categories such as building optimisation projects saving 3,600 MWh: a 3,100 MWh saving from adjusting our HVAC systems to align with reduced operational hours of our buildings globally; power optimisation improvements in our APAC portfolio saving 1,170 MWh; and end of life asset replacements together with the installation of LED lighting in our buildings which have achieved a combined 450MWh saving.\n\n## Research and development\n\n## Share capital\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group develops new products and services in each of its business divisions.\n\n## Share capital structure\n\nThe Company has ordinary shares in issue. The Company's Articles also allow for the issuance of sterling, US dollar, euro and yen preference shares (preference shares). No preference shares have been issued as at 16 February 2021 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report). Ordinary shares therefore represent 100% of the total issued\n\nshare capital as at 31 December 2020 and as at 16 February 2021 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report).\n\n## Voting\n\nDetails of the movement in ordinary share capital during the year can be found in Note 28 on page 346.\n\nEvery member who is present in person or represented at any general meeting of the Company, and who is entitled to vote, has one vote on a show of hands. Every proxy present has one vote. The proxy will have one vote for, and one vote against, a resolution if he/she has been instructed to vote for, or against, the resolution\n\nby different members or in one direction by a member while another member has permitted the proxy discretion as to how to vote.\n\nOn a poll, every member who is present or represented and who is entitled to vote has one vote for every share held. In the case of joint holders, only the vote of the senior holder (as determined by order in the share register) or his/ her proxy may be counted. If any sum payable remains unpaid in relation to a member's shareholding, that member is not entitled to vote that share or exercise any other right in relation to a meeting of the Company unless the Board otherwise determines.",

The Board may further direct that, if the shares of the defaulting member represent 0.25% or more of the issued shares of the relevant class, dividends or other monies payable on those shares shall be retained by the Company until the direction ceases to have effect and no transfer of those shares shall be registered (other than certain specified 'excepted transfers'). A direction ceases to have effect seven days after the Company has received the information requested, or when the Company is notified that an excepted transfer of all of the relevant shares to a third party has occurred, or as the Board otherwise determines.\n\nOrdinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Certificated ordinary shares may be transferred in writing in any usual or other form approved by the Group Company Secretary and executed by or on behalf of the transferor. Transfers of uncertificated ordinary shares must be made in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the CREST Regulations.\n\n## Transfers\n\nThe Board is not bound to register a transfer of partly paid ordinary shares or fully paid shares in exceptional circumstances approved by the FCA. The Board may also decline to register an instrument of transfer of certificated ordinary shares unless it is (i) duly stamped, deposited at the prescribed place and accompanied by the share certificate(s) and such other evidence as reasonably required by the Board to evidence right to transfer, (ii) it is in respect of one class of shares only, and (iii) it is in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees (except in the case of executors or trustees of a member).\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of section 84 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, preference shares may be issued only in registered form. Preference shares shall be transferred in writing in any usual or other form approved by the Group Company Secretary and executed by or on behalf of the transferor. The Company's registrar shall register such transfers of preference shares by making the appropriate entries in the register of preference shares. Each preference share shall confer, in the event of a winding up or any return of capital by reduction of capital (other than, unless otherwise provided by their terms of issue, a redemption or purchase by the Company of any of its issued shares, or a reduction of share capital), the right to receive out of the surplus\n\nassets of the Company available for distribution among the members and in priority to the holders of the ordinary shares and any other shares in the Company ranking junior to the relevant series of preference shares and pari passu with any other class of preference shares (other than any class of shares then in issue ranking in priority to the relevant series of preference shares), repayment of the amount paid up or treated as paid up in respect of the nominal value of the preference share together with any premium which was paid or treated as paid when the preference share was issued in addition to an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends.\n\nThe rights attached to any class of shares may be varied either with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.

The trustees of the EBTs have informed the Company that their normal policy is to abstain from voting in respect of the Barclays shares held in trust. The trustees of the Global Sharepurchase EBT and UK Sharepurchase EBT may vote in respect of Barclays shares held in the EBTs, but only as instructed by participants in those Plans in respect of their partnership shares and (when vested) matching and dividend shares.

In this context, the Committee has faced some extremely difficult decisions about the most appropriate way to remunerate colleagues for some outstanding work over the last 12 months. We have taken a number of important considerations into account, including our financial and non-financial performance in both relative and absolute terms, the views and expectations of our stakeholders, and the differing contributions of our businesses to the Group's financial resilience, which has in turn enabled us to support customers, clients and the communities that we serve. Our deliberations have been extensive, and I want to use this statement to be transparent with you about our decision-making.\n\nI am pleased to present the Directors' Remuneration Report for 2020, and my last statement to you as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. I know that my successor, Brian Gilvary, will be an excellent replacement and I wish him all the very best when he assumes the chair in March.\n\nAs ever, we have been guided by the principles of our Fair Pay agenda and, in particular, the importance of properly recognising the contribution of our junior colleagues. You can read more about our approach to fairness in our third annual Fair Pay Report, published alongside this document. Consistent with previous years, we have also published our UK pay gap figures and a narrative explaining them.\n\nRewarding sustainable performance remains a crucial aspect of the way the Committee considers its decisions. We recognise the pandemic's impact on our financial performance, with reductions in PBT and RoTE following a number of years of sustained annual improvements a . We are however proud of what we have achieved as an organisation in a truly difficult year. Not only have we remained fully open for business, supporting our customers and clients as they navigate the pandemic, we have demonstrated ourselves to be extremely resilient, remaining profitable in each quarter despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, while continuing to demonstrate a capacity for strong capital generation. Consequently, we have today announced a total payout equivalent to c.5p per share, comprising a 1.0p 2020 full year dividend and the intention to initiate a share buyback of up to \u00a3700m which I know will be welcome.\n\n## Performance\n\nWe have entered 2021 in a position of strength and stability for the future; well capitalised and importantly well-positioned to support an economic recovery.\n\nAs a result, Group income was up on 2019 despite an incredibly challenging year for our Corporate Bank and consumer businesses, impacted as they were by lower income and materially higher impairment charges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This capacity for one part of the Group's performance to offset another is an illustration of the benefits of the diversification that is inherent in our universal banking model. This has helped our ability to support the economy and society at a time of acute need.\n\nOur business diversification has meant that our investment banking businesses have been able to benefit from the increased volatility and wider trading margins observed during 2020. This, together with strong relative performance as evidenced particularly by the continued improvement in Markets market share b , has meant that these businesses have significantly outperformed expectations. Income in our Markets businesses is up 45% year on year and in Banking, income is up 8% year on year the biggest annual improvements since the reconfiguration of those businesses.\n\nAs set out in Nigel Higgins' and Jes Staley's letters to shareholders, we have delivered an enormous amount of financial support for our customers and clients this year, including facilitating c.\u00a327bn of finance to British businesses, waiving millions of pounds in fees for customers and helping corporate clients and governments raise billions to strengthen their balance sheets (underwriting c. \u00a31.5 trillion of new issuance c ). We have been able to do a significant amount for wider society too, whether through the launch of our \u00a3100m COVID-19 Community Aid Package, or in the steps we have taken on the road to becoming a net zero bank by 2050.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b   Source: Coalition Greenwich, Preliminary FY20 Competitor Analysis.

        "page_content": "## Colleague remuneration\n\nThe Committee's determination of the annual incentive pool includes consideration of a number of factors, such as financial performance, delivery of our strategy, risk and conduct. We consider Barclays' performance as a Group, but also take into account the performance of individual businesses within that Group, as well as those businesses' contributions to our strategic targets and vision, and their importance to our future success.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, our colleagues - many of whom were on the front line supporting customers - have worked incredibly hard to keep things running. Our financial resilience has allowed us to help them too, for instance by offering full pay to those unable to work because they were isolating or caring for dependants. We increased overtime rates to support colleagues given their need to work significantly extended hours, to both manage the unprecedented demands from customers and clients as well as the temporary loss of some geographical locations due to local lockdowns. Additionally, we enhanced our benefits where needed, including improving medical benefit provision in India and meeting additional childcare needs where required. We did not put any staff on furlough (indeed hiring additional colleagues, with overall headcount up slightly on 2019), and implemented a temporary moratorium on redundancies.\n\nAssessing and rewarding performance in this way also means that the Group incentive pool does not always move directly in line with the Group's overall financial performance. In 2019, while financial performance was up and non-financial performance was also very strong, the incentive pool was reduced to support our continued progression towards our strategic targets in terms of delivering greater returns to shareholders. This year, we have had to consider how we balance the need to maintain our successful universal banking model, with the financial challenges that we and others have faced.\n\nHowever, consistent with our Fair Pay agenda, we have chosen to protect outcomes for our junior colleagues and, as a result, the greatest reductions in incentives will be observed for more senior colleagues in these businesses.\n\nFor many businesses, such as our Corporate Bank and consumer businesses (including Barclays UK - our ring-fenced bank) profit before tax is down, driven by lower income and higher impairment costs. At the same time, strategic delivery has been very strong, continuing to make progress on our digital agenda and focusing on our customer and client experiences. Balancing these different considerations, the incentive pools for all of these businesses are down this year, reflecting the lower financial performance outcomes.\n\nIt has been junior colleagues in many businesses who have been on the front line directly supporting customers and clients during the pandemic and the Committee felt it appropriate to reward those efforts.\n\nSince 2018, the profitability a of the Corporate and Investment Bank has increased by 51% (2020 up 31% on 2019), with the associated improvement in returns. This strong performance has been driven by increases in investment banking revenues, specifically in FICC and equities, where we have continued to grow market share b . We are the only scale British investment bank; we operate globally and, importantly, we have a leading presence in the US (correspondingly, almost three-quarters of the incentive pool for the investment bank businesses relates to populations outside the UK). Our investment banking businesses provide us with a point of strategic advantage as we move into 2021 and beyond, providing an important diversification of income stream, particularly at a time of so much transformation and challenge in the retail banking sector. It is appropriate that we reward the exceptional collective effort of these colleagues, albeit with the appropriate restraint.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee believes it is right to recognise the outstanding work of our investment banking colleagues this year, particularly given the continued financial performance improvements of those businesses and their significant contribution to the Group's overall financial resilience.\n\nTaking all of this into account, the Committee has approved a Group incentive pool of \u00a31,580m. This represents a relatively modest increase across the investment banking businesses, reductions for all other businesses and appropriate recognition for the contributions of our more junior colleagues. The unusual dynamic for 2020 is the significantly lower contribution to the Group financial results from our Corporate banking and consumer businesses, driven principally by impairment. While the incentive pools in those areas have been reduced as noted above, they are relatively small in relation to the overall incentive pool. The result is that significant reductions in financial contributions originating from those business areas cannot be directly reflected in proportionate reductions to the overall incentive pool.\n\nWe believe that this outcome is appropriate given the performance delivered, and that it is consistent with our philosophy of rewarding sustainable performance, which in turn supports our long-term strategy of delivering improved returns to shareholders. As always, a significant portion of the pool is delivered in shares, most of which will be deferred over a number of years.\n\nGroup income \u00a321,766m 2019: \u00a321,632m 2018: \u00a321,136m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup profit before tax (excluding L&C) \u00a33,218m 2019: \u00a36,206m 2018: \u00a35,701m\n\nGroup RoTE (excluding L&C)\n\n3.4% 2019: 9.0% 2018: 8.5%\n\nCost: income ratio (excluding L&C)\n\n61% c 2019: 62% c 2018: 66%\n\nCET1 ratio 15.1% 2019: 13.8% 2018: 13.2%\n\nGroup compensation to income ratio\n\n34.2% 2019: 33.9% 2018: 34.1% d\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup incentive pool \u00a31,580m 2019: \u00a31,490m 2018:\u00a31,649m\n\n## Notes\n\n- b   Source: Coalition Greenwich, Preliminary FY20 Competitor Analysis.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\n## Annual Statement: Summary of 2020 pay outcomes continued\n\n## Executive Director remuneration\n\nThe Committee has considered at length the appropriateness of bonus and LTIP outcomes for the Executive Directors for 2020. Annual bonuses were assessed against the financial, strategic and personal measures that were set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report for 2019. While Group income was up slightly year on year and costs well controlled, the impact of the pandemic on impairment resulted in significantly reduced 2020 bonus outcomes, 38.6% of maximum for the CEO and GFD, down materially from the outcomes for 2019 (75% and 75.9%, respectively). Similarly, the outcome for the 2018-2020 LTIP was also materially impacted by impairment, with an outcome of 23% of maximum, down from 48.5% for the 2017-2019 LTIP.\n\nThe Executive Directors responded quickly to the pandemic, agreeing to postpone increases to their Fixed Pay which had been proposed as part of the new Directors' remuneration policy introduced last year. They also took the decision to donate one-third of their Fixed Pay for six months to our COVID-19 Community Aid Package. The Committee also decided to postpone the first instalment of their 20172019 LTIP awards, which had been due to be released in June 2020, until 2021. The Executive Directors requested, and the Committee accepted, that their 2020 Fixed Pay increases (now approved) be postponed again, until at least the second half of this year when the Committee will reconsider the implementation with them, in light of the prevailing external environment.\n\nWhile the Committee did review the continued appropriateness of the respective plan measures and targets given the exogenous nature of the pandemic, it prioritised the need to ensure appropriate alignment between the outcomes for the Executive Directors with the experience of investors. In particular, this included the sector-wide cancellation of the 2019 dividend in line with UK regulatory expectations and the associated delay in the benefit of that distribution experienced by our shareholders. While this benefit will likely be realised in the future, given the additional capital retained and the recommencement of distributions, the delay was considered by the Committee, alongside the broader challenges facing society as a whole.\n\nWe believe the outcomes on both bonus and LTIP align appropriately with stakeholder considerations. They take into account financial performance outcomes, very strong non-financial delivery and the exceptional contributions of the Executive Directors - both the outstanding leadership provided during the year, and the positive impact of a multi-year strategy and transformation that has enabled us to continue to deliver so effectively for stakeholders during a time of such challenge.\n\nWe have not changed in-flight bonus and LTIP arrangements and have not altered the performance measures or targets for these plans.\n\nTotal variable pay (annual bonus and LTIP) will be primarily delivered in shares for the Executive Directors, aligning more closely to the shareholder experience during this particularly difficult period. The Executive Directors continue to build substantial shareholdings, and neither have sold any shares since their appointments.\n\nThe Committee has also considered the performance measures for the 2021 bonus and 2021-2023 LTIP very carefully. The bonus measures are unchanged, as they continue to represent relevant building blocks towards our key longer-term financial goals.\n\nFor the 2021-2023 LTIP, we have decided to broaden the measures on which the financial assessment will be based. As we continue to navigate through a more volatile macroeconomic environment, this will better balance our long-term assessment of the Executive Directors' financial performance. RoTE and CIR will be maintained as measures, though RoTE will be tested at the end of the cycle, helping to determine how effectively the Executive Directors navigate the financial recovery and steer Barclays back towards our targets over the medium term. In addition to RoTE, we will be adding CET1 and relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measures. The addition of a CET1 measure reflects the continued importance of our prudential stability and balance sheet strength, particularly in the coming potentially difficult years. Adding a relative TSR measure acknowledges the challenges associated with calibrating absolute performance targets in the current uncertain environment, providing instead a relative performance lens that is not subject to the same difficulties, while maintaining a 50% total weighting on returns measures.\n\nIn addition, we are adding a specific Climate measure with a weighting of 10% to the non-financial assessment of the 2021-2023 LTIP, reflecting our ambition to be net zero by 2050, including our commitment to align our financing with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nFurther details on Executive Director remuneration, including the consideration of windfall gains on the 2020-2022 LTIP, and the full details of the new LTIP to be granted for 2021-2023 are set out in this report.\n\nAs we move into 2021, the Committee will be ensuring that the new Purpose, Values and Mindset are reflected in our remuneration policies and approaches, as we work to embed them throughout the organisation.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their guidance and expertise during my tenure, as well as all of the stakeholders with whom I have been fortunate enough to engage. I look forward to continuing to serve Barclays as the Chair of the Board of Barclays Bank UK PLC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Crawford Gillies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChair, Board Remuneration Committee February 2021",

It is closely aligned with Provision 40 of the FRC's UK Corporate Governance Code, and we have continued to be transparent on the resulting outcomes in this report.\n\nThe pay decisions set out in this report are a result of the application of our remuneration philosophy during 2020.\n\nSpecifically relating to our Executive Directors, we have reviewed the performance measures for the forward-looking incentives, and in particular have updated the financial performance measures for the 2021-2023 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of current circumstances and challenges. Alongside our strategic non-financial performance objectives, this will ensure that the link between the delivery of our strategy (and long-term performance) and individual awards continues to be reinforced. The report sets out\n\nminimum and maximum potential outcomes under each plan for reference. Furthermore, the alignment of executive pay to culture is enhanced by the inclusion of the responsibility to embed our updated Purpose, Values and Mindset throughout the organisation in the personal objectives for our Group CEO.\n\nWe consider the views of all of our stakeholders in remuneration decisionmaking. In 2020, we have achieved this by meeting with institutional shareholders to understand their views on our new policy (including how it should be implemented), engaging extensively with our regulators to support their actions as a result of the pandemic, and continuing our partnership with Unite in the UK to understand the views of their members and negotiate a new pay deal, delivering an above-inflation increase. We used our 2019 Fair Pay report to share information on our approach to pay with colleagues, including how executive remuneration aligns with wider company pay policy, and are now publishing our third report to help do the same for 2020.",

The Fair Pay agenda brings together the five themes which explain how we think about fair pay at Barclays. We use our Fair Pay Report to engage our employees on pay, explaining our approach to fair pay, including the alignment of the Executive Directors' and employee pay. We encourage you to read the full Fair Pay Report.\n\n## Customers and clients\n\n- \u00b7  A number of actions were taken for customers and clients who needed additional financial support, as well as facilitating the delivery of c.\u00a327bn of lending to British businesses under the UK Government's schemes. Our Colleagues took on significant extra work during the pandemic to make this happen.\n\n## Colleagues\n\n- \u00b7  Separate reporting was implemented for COVID-related sickness absence, extending our existing sick pay provisions.\n\nOur approach to fair pay helped guide our remuneration decisionmaking in 2020. In turn, this enhanced the support we were able to provide to our customers and clients, colleagues and society throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n- \u00b7 Enhanced flexibility was introduced for all colleagues with other commitments e.g. the need to care for dependants, including children, and where it was not possible for them to complete their full hours, we continued to pay them their full salary and benefits.\n- \u00b7 We did not put any staff on furlough, and placed a moratorium on redundancies in the early months of the pandemic.\n\n## Society\n\n- \u00b7 Our Executive Directors and Chairman contributed one third of their fixed pay for six months to charities delivering COVID-19 relief.\n- \u00b7  We have matched donations through our Community Aid Package from our colleagues and our Directors, supporting the communities most impacted by the pandemic\n- \u00b7  In the UK, we supported colleagues who volunteered to support health or social care, with up to four weeks of paid leave.\n\n## Our approach to fair pay enhanced our support for customers and clients, colleagues and society during COVID-19.\n\nAs well as using the Fair Pay agenda to guide our approach to remuneration in relation to the pandemic, we have also continued to focus on advancing the agenda as it relates to each of the themes. The key highlights for 2020 are shown below.\n\n## Fair Pay for the lowest paid\n\n- \u00b7  Worked with Unite to agree a new pay deal, ensuring that it was consistent with our Fair Pay agenda.\n- \u00b7  Continued to progress our work on global living wages, reviewing more locations than in 2019.\n- \u00b7  Enhanced medical provision for all colleagues in the UK and India, providing access to a range of online services and appointments.\n\n## Equal Pay\n\n- \u00b7  All grievances raised by employees, including any issues relating to pay are investigated as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 We are explicit that pay decisions must not take into account gender, age, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic.\n\n## Equal opportunities to progress\n\n- \u00b7  Further developed our diversity dashboards for senior leaders which now reflect both gender and ethnic diversity.\n- \u00b7  Implemented a detailed action plan on Race at Work that will open up opportunities to attract, develop and add to our great Black talent.\n- \u00b7  Our female senior leadership continued to increase and is now 26%, up from 25% at the end of 2019.\n\n## Alignment of employee and executive remuneration\n\n- \u00b7  The Directors' remuneration policy has been refreshed, aligning Executive Director pension contributions with the wider workforce.\n- \u00b7  Our pay policies are strongly aligned across the wider workforce, senior employees and Executive Directors.\n\n## Listening to employees\n\n- \u00b7  We engaged with Unite throughout the pandemic, focusing on the physical and mental wellbeing of our colleagues.\n- \u00b7 We launched our Inclusion Index for the first time to measure our objective to be a truly inclusive organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBarclays PLC 2020 Fair Pay Report can be found online at home.barclays/annualreport\n\n- \u00b7  Our focus was on ensuring that we were available for our customers and clients despite the challenges of COVID-related absences and the temporary loss of some geographical locations due to local lockdowns. We supported this effort by providing Colleagues with additional overtime rates where needed.",

All employees are  considered, subject to eligibility criteria.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                    | For senior employees, an appropriate proportion of their annual bonus is deferred to future years. Deferred  bonuses are generally delivered in equal portions as deferred cash and shares. They are subject to either a  three, five or seven-year deferral period (and further holding periods of six or 12 months for deferrals in shares)  in line with regulatory requirements.                                             |\n|                                    | remuneration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                    | Consistent with regulation, the remuneration of MRTs is subject to the 2:1 maximum ratio of variable to fixed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Share plans Performance management | We encourage wider employee share ownership through the all-employee share plans, with plans available to  99% of colleagues globally. Performance assessment is based on 'what' is achieved in relation to individual, team and business objectives,                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                                    | as well as 'how' this is achieved in the context of Barclays' Values. Both elements are assessed independently  of each other with no requirement to have an overall rating. This reinforces the equal importance of the 'what'  and 'how'.                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Risk and conduct                   | Risk and conduct is taken seriously at Barclays and the Committee ensures that there are in-year adjustments,  malus or clawback applied to individual remuneration, where appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                                    | In addition to individual adjustments, the Committee considers collective adjustments to the incentive pool  for risk and conduct.

Delivered 50% in cash (paid monthly) and 50% in shares. The shares are delivered quarterly and are subject to a  holding period with restrictions lifting over five years (20% each year). As the Executive Directors beneficially  own the shares, they will be entitled to any dividends paid on those shares.

The release of the first tranche of the LTIP vest was delayed from June 2020 to March 2021 and as such the amount has not been restated.\n\n## Additional information in respect of each element of pay for the Executive Directors (audited)\n\nFixed Pay is delivered 50% in cash and 50% in shares (subject to a five-year holding period lifting pro-rata).\n\n## 1) Fixed Pay\n\n## 2) Pension\n\n## 3) Taxable benefits\n\nExecutive Directors are paid cash in lieu of pension contributions. The pension cash allowance in 2020 was \u00a3396,000 per annum until 6 May 2020 and \u00a3117,500 thereafter for Jes Staley and \u00a3200,000 per annum until 6 May 2020 and \u00a382,500 per annum thereafter for Tushar Morzaria. No other benefits were received by the Executive Directors from any Barclays' pension plan.\n\nTaxable benefits include private medical cover, life assurance, income protection, tax advice, car allowance and the use of a Company vehicle and driver when required for business purposes.\n\nThe bonus amount included in the single total figure is the value awarded or scheduled to be awarded in Q1 following the financial year to which it relates. The Committee considered the Executive Directors' performance against the financial (60% weighting) and strategic non-financial (20% weighting) performance measures which had been set to reflect Company priorities for 2020. Performance against their individual personal objectives (20% weighting) was assessed on an individual basis.\n\n## 4) Annual bonus\n\nThe approach taken to assessing financial performance against each of the financial measures was based on a straight-line outcome between 20% for threshold performance and 100% applicable to each measure for achievement of maximum performance.

In aggregate, this results in an overall formulaic outcome for Tushar of 38.6% or \u00a3573,000, of which 30% will be deferred under the Share Value Plan.\n\n## 5) LTIP\n\nIn line with the DRP, and due to the regulations prohibiting dividend equivalents being paid on unvested deferred share awards, the number of shares awarded to each Executive Director under the Share Value Plan will be calculated using a share price at the date of award, discounted to reflect the absence of dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The valuation will be aligned to IFRS 2, with the market expectations of dividends during the deferral period being assessed by an independent adviser. These shares will vest in two equal tranches on the first and second anniversary (subject to the rules of the Share Value Plan as amended from time to time). All shares (whether deferred or not) are subject to a further one-year holding period from the point of release. 2020 bonuses are subject to clawback provisions and, additionally, unvested deferred 2020 bonuses are subject to malus provisions which enable the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses (including to nil).\n\nThe LTIP amount included in the single total figure is the value of the amount scheduled to be released in relation to the LTIP award granted in 2018 in respect of the performance period 2018-2020 (by reference to Q4 2020 average share price). Release is dependent on, among other things, performance over the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020 with straight-line vesting applied between the threshold and maximum points for the financial measures.

The market share price was 22% down on the market share price at the prior year grant due to various global factors, which we believe were mostly not specific to Barclays. Under the LTIP, the Committee has full discretion to ensure that the final outcomes are warranted based on the performance of the Group in light of all relevant factors and that there have not been any windfall gains. The factors considered in making this assessment will be described at the time of vest.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\n## Annual report on Directors' remuneration continued\n\n## 2021-2023 LTIP\n\nThe objective of the LTIP is to incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver on the long-term strategy, without encouraging excessive risk-taking. In its deliberations on the appropriate financial performance measures for the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle, the Committee reflected on the significant remaining macroeconomic uncertainty. Given the challenges that such uncertainty introduces to the calibration of absolute financial targets, the Committee decided to introduce a relative performance measure, in the form of 25% relative Total Shareholder Return. The weighting of the RoTE measure will be correspondingly reduced to 25% (from 50% in the previous cycle) to retain a total of 50% on returns-type measures.  It will be tested in 2023, the final year of the performance period, to help in determining how effectively the Executive Directors navigate the financial recovery and steer Barclays back towards our targets over the medium term.\n\nThe Committee decided to make an award under the 2021-2023 LTIP cycle to Jes Staley and Tushar Morzaria with a face value at grant of 140% of Fixed Pay for the CEO and 134% of Fixed Pay for the GFD.  This maximum award was determined following a detailed review of their individual performance throughout 2020 and significant personal contribution to the resilience of the Group, and the Committee was comfortable that this is commensurate with performance delivered.  This share based award ensures alignment with future performance over the three-year assessment period, as well as, shareholder alignment over the long release period (up to eight years from initial award).\n\nAn additional challenge arising from such uncertainty going into 2021 and beyond will be to ensure that the Group remains appropriately focused on prudential stability and balance sheet strength, while continuing to be able to support our customers and clients, and the economies in which we operate. Given this focus, the Committee decided to introduce a standalone CET1 measure for 10% of the award. CIR is also maintained as an average measure over the performance period, with its weighting slightly reduced to 10%.\n\nThe Committee also considered how our ambition to be net zero by 2050 should be reflected in pay for the Executive Directors. The decision was to include a standalone Climate measure within the LTIP, providing clear alignment between the LTIP outcome, up to a maximum of 10%, and progress towards our targets which will help us to become net zero by 2050. To accommodate the addition of the Climate measure, the weighting for the Risk Scorecard and Strategic non-financial measures (excluding Climate) will be reduced to 10% each.\n\nAs noted above, the unique societal and resulting macroeconomic circumstances have created significant challenges in calibrating absolute longer-term plan targets. Given the inherent uncertainty, and the desire to avoid setting targets that in retrospect turn out to be much more challenging or simpler than intended, the Committee wanted to ensure that the performance targets for RoTE and CIR appropriately reflect the full range of potential outcomes around the current forecasts (acknowledging that the various potential macroeconomic risks and opportunities are largely outside the direct control of the Executive Directors). This will ensure that the LTIP has the desired effect of continuing to motivate and retain the executives throughout the performance period, whilst still requiring a very strong performance for full vesting. Given this basis for the calibration of the ranges, the vesting proportion for attaining threshold performance has been correspondingly reduced from the previous 20% to 0%.  This does not impact the TSR or CET1 measures. The Committee retains ultimate discretion to ensure that the outcomes are appropriate in light of all relevant factors at the end of the performance period.\n\nPerformance against the Risk Scorecard has improved over the last three years, giving an outcome of 12% out of 15% for the 2018-2020 LTIP. While it is very important that the Executive Directors focus on maintaining performance in this area, the Committee felt comfortable that a lower weighting could be applied.\n\nThe 2021-2023 LTIP award will be subject to the following forward-looking performance measures.\n\n| Performance measure                                         | Weighting   | Threshold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Maximum vesting                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2023 return on tangible  equity (RoTE) ex material  items a | 25%         | 0% of award vests for RoTE of 6.0% rising on a  straight-line basis                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RoTE of 12.0%                                                                 |\n| Average cost: income  ratio ex material items               | 10%         | 0% of award vests for average cost: income ratio  of 65.0% rising on a straight-line basis                                                                                                                                                                                        | Average cost: income ratio of 62.0%                                           |\n| Maintain CET1 ratio within  the target range                | 10%         | If CET1 is below MDA hurdle b  +180bps during the  period, the Committee will consider what portion  of this element should vest, based on the causes  of the CET1 reduction.                                                                                                     | CET1 ratio between 180bps and 280bps above  MDA hurdle throughout the period. |\n| Maintain CET1 ratio within  the target range                |             | If CET1 is above MDA hurdle +280bps but does  not make progress towards the range over the  period, the Committee will consider what portion  of this element should vest, based on the reasons  for the elevated levels of CET1 versus target  range and the associated impacts. |                                                                               |\n| Relative Total Shareholder  Return (TSR)                    | 25%         | 6.25% vests for performance c  at median of the  peer group d  rising on a straight-line basis                                                                                                                                                                                    | Performance at the upper quartile                                             |",

It is also subject to deferral, additional holding periods, malus and clawback. In line with reporting requirements, we have provided an indication of the maximum remuneration receivable, assuming share price appreciation of 50% on the LTIP.\n\nThe charts below show the potential value of the current Executive Directors' 2021 total remuneration in three main scenarios: 'Minimum' (i.e. Fixed Pay, Pension and benefits), 'Mid-point' (i.e. Fixed Pay, Pension, benefits and 50% of the maximum variable pay that may be awarded) and 'Maximum' (i.e. Fixed Pay, Pension, benefits and the maximum variable pay that may be awarded). For the purposes of these charts, the value of benefits is based on an estimated annual value for 2021 regular contractual benefits. Additional ad hoc benefits may arise, for example, overseas relocation of Executive Directors, but will always be provided in line with the DRP.\n\n## Total remuneration opportunity:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual bonus\n\nThe illustrative scenarios are based on current Fixed Pay for the Executive Directors.

The change in the pay ratios for 2020 is explained in more detail below.\n\n|      | Option   | 25th percentile   | Median   | 75th percentile   |\n|------|----------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|\n| 2020 | A        | 137 x             | 90 x     | 51 x              |\n| 2019 | A        | 213 x             | 140 x    | 77 x              |\n| 2018 | A        | 126 x             | 85 x     | 45x               |\n\nThe regulations provide three options which may be used to calculate total pay for the employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile. Following guidance issued by some proxy advisers and institutional shareholders, we have selected Option A to calculate total pay for each calendar year using the employee population on the 31st of December of each respective year.\n\nOption A calculates total pay for all employees on the same basis as the single figure for remuneration is calculated for Executive Directors. Total pay for each employee includes earned Fixed Pay, which is made up of salary, Role Based Pay (RBP) and relevant allowances, annual incentives awarded for the 2020 calendar year, and an estimate of pension and benefits for 2020. Other elements of pay such as overtime and shift allowances have been excluded as previously. The estimate of pension for each employee is based on the percentage currently available to new hires in the UK (between 10% for the more senior and 12% for the more junior Corporate Grades). The estimate of benefits is based on the cost of core benefits available at each Corporate Grade, including private medical insurance, income protection and life assurance. Calculations use full-time equivalent pay data taken from our HR systems for all employees.",

The CEO pay ratio is one of the outcomes of all of these decisions, which are explained in more detail in the Chairman's statement.\n\nThe decrease in the CEO single figure of remuneration from 2019 to 2020 is a result of lower outcomes on the CEO's annual bonus and LTIP due to reduced performance against financial measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the decrease in Executive Director pension contributions which were reduced as part of the new DRP in May 2020. The impact of the reduced financial performance on pay for the median employee is minimal, given the comparatively higher proportion of fixed pay, and the Company's approach to protecting annual incentives outcomes for the more junior colleagues, in line with our approach to fair pay and to reward their contributions to supporting customers and clients during the pandemic.\n\n## Total remuneration of the employees in the Barclays Bank Group\n\nBarclays is a global business and particularly within the investment banking businesses a large proportion of our business and employees are based outside of the UK, with a strong presence in the US. Of those employees earning above \u00a31m in total remuneration for 2020 in the table below, 59% are based in the US, and only 33% in the UK and 8% in the rest of the world.\n\nThe table shows the number of employees in the Barclays Bank Group as at 31 December 2019 and 2020 in bands by reference to total remuneration. Total remuneration comprises salary, RBP, other allowances, bonus and the value at award of LTIP awards.\n\n|                          | Number of employees   | Number of employees   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Remuneration band        | 2020                  | 2019                  |\n| \u00a30 to \u00a325,000            | 27,446                | 26,706                |\n| \u00a325,001 to \u00a350,000       | 27,815                | 26,989                |\n| \u00a350,001 to \u00a3100,000      | 18,799                | 18,266                |\n| \u00a3100,001 to \u00a3250,000     | 11,534                | 11,428                |\n| \u00a3250,001 to \u00a3500,000     | 2,217                 | 2,259                 |\n| \u00a3500,001 to \u00a31,000,000   | 882                   | 884                   |\n| \u00a31,000,001 to \u00a32,000,000 | 325                   | 290                   |\n| \u00a32,000,001 to \u00a33,000,000 | 71                    | 68                    |\n| \u00a33,000,001 to \u00a34,000,000 | 31                    | 23                    |\n| \u00a34,000,001 to \u00a35,000,000 | 10                    | 5                     |\n| \u00a35,000,001 to \u00a36,000,000 | 8                     | 11                    |\n| Above \u00a36,000,000         | 3                     | 2                     |",

        "page_content": "## Annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors' and employees\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change in the Executive Directors' Fixed Pay, benefits and bonus between 2019 and 2020 compared with the percentage change in each of those components of pay for UK-based employees, and employees of the Barclays PLC (BPLC) the Parent company of the Group.\n\n|           |                         | Fixed Pay   | Benefits   | Annual bonus   |\n|-----------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|----------------|\n| 2019/2020 | Group CEO               | 0%          | 10%        | -49%           |\n|           | Group FD                | 0%          | 9%         | -49%           |\n|           | Median UK employee      | 7%          | 20%        | -16%           |\n|           | Median employee of BPLC | 7%          | 26%        | -16%           |\n\nFor the Executive Directors, percentage change figures are calculated using the single total figure for 2020 remuneration table. Their increases in benefits from 2019 to 2020 are due to increased costs of the provision of private medical cover, life assurance and income protection. Similarly, for the UK employees and employees of BPLC, the increase in median benefits value between 2019 and 2020 is also due to an increase in the costs of the provision of private medical cover, life assurance and income protection.\n\nBPLC only employs a very small number of Head Office employees (56 for 2020). Between 2019 and 2020, BPLC experienced significant headcount movement with around half the 2019 BPLC employees, predominantly at more junior levels, moving to other Legal employing entities in 2020. In order to make a meaningful year on year comparison, the figures are therefore based on all individuals employed by BPLC in both years.\n\nFor the UK employees, in addition to typical salary increases, the 7% increase in median Fixed Pay also reflects the impact of the Barclays UK Reward Strategy changes (effective July 2019). This amended how pay is structured for c.19,500 employees in line with our approach to fair pay. For the impacted employees, a portion of previous  bonus opportunity was transferred into Fixed Pay, ensuring a larger proportion of their overall pay package is fixed, pensionable and is not impacted by business performance. These increases in Fixed Pay and reductions in bonus opportunity are reflected in pay for the second half of 2019 and full year for 2020, also contributing to the 16% decrease in median bonus.\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change in fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors' between 2019 and 2020. Non-Executive Directors who joined on or after 1 January 2020 are not included.\n\nAs set out in the 2019 Directors' Remuneration Report, all Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman received an increase of \u00a310,000 to their basic Board fee from 1 January 2020 - the first increase to this fee since 2011. The Chairman receives an all-inclusive fee which was not increased. Fees were also increased by \u00a310,000 for the Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees (the first increases since 2011 and 2017, respectively) and by \u00a35,000 for members of the Risk Committee (last increased in 2011). Other increases relate to set fees for additional responsibilities taken on by the Non-Executive Directors in 2020.\n\n|           |                        | Fees   |\n|-----------|------------------------|--------|\n|           | Nigel Higgins a        | 0%     |\n|           | Mike Ashley b          | 19%    |\n|           | Tim Breedon b          | 24%    |\n|           | Sir Ian Cheshire       | 2%     |\n| 2019/2020 | Mary Anne Citrino a, b | 33%    |\n|           | Dawn Fitzpatrick a, c  | 36%    |\n|           | Mary Francis b         | -3%    |\n|           | Crawford Gillies       | 4%     |\n|           | Diane Schueneman b     | 3%     |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  These Non-Executive Directors joined the Board of BBPLC in September 2019 and received a pro-rata fee for that year. For 2020, the full year fee of \u00a330,000 was paid. The same applies to the Board fees for BCSL for Mike Ashley and Tim Breedon, for which an annual fee of \u00a320,000 is paid. A significant portion of the change in fees relates to these additional responsibilities.\n- a For those who were appointed during 2019 or who stood down during 2020, fees are pro-rated up for the purposes of this comparison.\n- c Dawn Fitzpatrick joined the Risk Committee on 1 January 2020 and received the fee of \u00a330,000 for this additional responsibility from that date. This accounts for 27% of the increase.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nA year on year comparison of Group compensation costs and distributions to shareholders are shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Barclays Board Remuneration Committee\n\n## Terms of Reference\n\nThe Committee is responsible for overseeing Barclays' remuneration as described in more detail below.\n\nThe role of the Committee is to:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 consider and approve the remuneration arrangements of (i) the Chairman, (ii) the Executive Directors, (iii) members of the Barclays Group Executive Committee and any other senior executives specified by the Committee from time to time, and (iv) all other Group employees whose total annual compensation exceeds an amount determined by the Committee from time to time (currently \u00a32m); and\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 set the overarching principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 exercise oversight for remuneration issues.\n\n## Committee effectiveness in 2020\n\nThe Committee considers the overarching objectives, principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group to ensure it is adopting a coherent approach in respect of all employees. In discharging this responsibility, the Committee seeks to ensure that the policy is fair and transparent, avoids complexity and assesses, among other things, the impact of pay arrangements in supporting the Group's culture, Values and strategy and on all elements of risk management. The Committee also approves incentive pools for each of the Group, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and BX, periodically reviews (at least annually) all material matters of retirement benefit design and governance, and exercises judgement in the application of remuneration policies to promote the long-term success of the Group for the benefit of shareholders. The Committee and its members work as necessary with other Board Committees, and is authorised to select and appoint its own advisers as required.\n\nThe 2020 Committee effectiveness review was conducted in accordance with the Code. This internal review involved completion of a tailored questionnaire by Committee members and senior management, in line with the approach adopted for all Board Committees in 2020. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nThe Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective, with continued positive engagement and dialogue with senior management. It was also noted that the natural overlay with the Board Risk Committee had been reflected formally in the Committee's Terms of Reference during the year. In response to a request to provide feedback on interaction with subsidiary committees, the Committee's interaction with the principal subsidiary remuneration committees was also considered effective, and in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe results confirm that the Committee is operating effectively. The Committee continues to be well constituted and provides an effective level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. In particular, feedback indicates that the Committee continued to operate effectively during the year in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, notwithstanding the need to convene remotely. It was also noted that the Committee spends time on key judgement areas, which was of particular importance during 2020. Consideration will be given to adding an additional member of the Committee, in light of Crawford Gillies stepping down as Committee Chair at the end of February 2021.\n\nFollowing the consolidation of the membership of the Committee with the BBPLC Board Remuneration Committee in September 2019 (with the exception of the Committee Chair and Brian Gilvary, who attend as observers only for matters relating to BBPLC), coverage of BBPLC matters within aligned meetings was considered adequate.\n\n## Advisers to the Committee\n\nPwC was paid \u00a3121,000 (excluding VAT) in fees for their advice to the Committee in 2020 relating to the Executive Directors (either exclusively or along with other employees within the Committee's Terms of Reference). In addition to advising the Committee, PwC provided unrelated consulting advice to the Group in respect of strategic advice on business, operational models and cost, corporate taxation, climate-related financial disclosures, data strategy, technology consulting and internal audit.\n\nThe Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as the independent adviser in October 2017. The Committee considered the independence and objectivity of advice provided by PwC during the year to the Committee and was satisfied that it is independent and objective. PwC is a signatory to the voluntary UK Code of Conduct for executive remuneration consultants.\n\nThroughout 2020, Willis Towers Watson (WTW) continued to provide the Committee with market data on compensation when considering incentive levels and remuneration packages. WTW were paid \u00a365,000 (excluding VAT) in fees for their services. In addition to the services provided to the Committee, WTW also provides pensions and benefits advice, insurance brokerage and pensions advice and administration services to the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund.\n\nNo Barclays' employee or Director participates in discussions with, or decisions of, the Committee relating to his or her own remuneration. No other advisers provided services to the Committee in the year.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Committee also considers the views of the Group Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director and the Group Reward and Performance Director. The Group Finance Director and the Group Chief Risk Officer provide regular updates on Group and business financial performance and risk profiles, respectively.",

Risk reports to executive and Board committees are clearly organised by principal risk. In addition, certain risks span more than one principal risk; these are also subject to the ERMF and are reported to executive and Board committees.\n\nThe ERMF identifies eight principal risks and sets out associated responsibilities and expectations around risk management standards. The principal risks are: credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, operational risk, model risk, conduct risk, reputation risk and legal risk.\n\n## Risk appetite for the principal risks\n\nRisk appetite is approved by the Barclays PLC Board and disseminated across legal entities. Total Group risk appetite is supported by limits to control exposures and activities that have material concentration risk implications.\n\nRisk appetite is defined as the level of risk which the Group's businesses are prepared to accept in the conduct of their activities. It provides a basis for ongoing dialogue between management and Board with respect to the Group's current and evolving risk profile, allowing strategic and financial decisions to be made on an informed basis.\n\n## Risk committees\n\nIn addition to setting the risk appetite of the Group, the Board is responsible for approving the ERMF, and reviewing all reputation risk matters. It receives regular information on the risk profile of the bank, and has ultimate responsibility for risk appetite and capital plans.\n\nVarious committees also fulfil important roles and responsibilities. Barclays business level product/risk type committees consider risk matters relevant to their business, and escalate as required to the Group Risk Committee (GRC), whose Chairman, in turn, escalates to the Barclays PLC Board Committees and the Barclays PLC Board.\n\nFurther, there are two Board-level committees which oversee the application of the ERMF and implementation of key aspects, the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee (BAC). Membership of these committees is comprised solely of Non-Executive Directors providing independent oversight and challenge. Additionally, the Barclays PLC Board Remuneration Committee oversee pay practices focusing on aligning pay to sustainable performance.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee (BAC): the BAC receives regular reports on the effectiveness of internal control systems, quarterly reports on material control issues of significance, quarterly papers on accounting judgements (including impairment), and a quarterly review of the adequacy of impairment allowances, relative to the risk inherent in the portfolios, the business environment, and Barclays policies and methodologies.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee (BRC): the BRC monitors the Group's risk profile against the agreed appetite. Where actual performance differs from expectations, the actions taken by management are reviewed to ascertain that the BRC is comfortable with them. The BRC also reviews certain key risk methodologies, the effectiveness of risk management, and the Group's risk profile, including the material issues affecting each business portfolio and forward risk trends. The committee also commissions in-depth analyses of significant risk topics, which are presented by the Group CRO or senior risk managers.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Barclays PLC Board Remuneration Committee (RemCo): the RemCo receives a report on risk management performance and risk profile, and proposals on ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustments to variable remuneration. These inputs are considered in the setting of performance incentives.\n\nThe terms of reference and additional details on membership and activities for each of the principal Board committees are available from the corporate governance section of the Barclays website at: home.barclays/aboutbarclays/barclays-corporate-governance.html.\n\nThe GRC is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the risk profile of the Group. This includes coverage of all principal risks, and any other material risks, to which the Group is exposed. The GRC reviews and recommends the proposed risk appetite and relative limits to the BRC. The committee covers all business units and legal entities with the Group and incorporates specific coverage of Barclays Bank Group.\n\nRisk culture can be defined as the norms, attitudes and behaviours related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. This is reflected in how the Group identifies, escalates and manages risk matters.\n\n## Barclays' risk culture\n\nBarclays is committed to maintaining a robust risk culture in which:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 colleagues identify, manage and escalate risk and control matters, and meet their responsibilities around risk management.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 management expect, model and reward the right behaviours from a risk and control perspective\n\nSpecifically, all employees regardless of their positions, functions or locations must play their part in the Group's risk management.

Material risks are those to which senior management pay particular attention and which could cause the delivery of the Group's strategy, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects to differ materially from expectations. Emerging risks are those which have unknown components, the impact of which could crystallise over a longer time period. In addition, certain other factors beyond the Group's control, including escalation of terrorism or global conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics and similar events, although not detailed below, could have a similar impact on the Group.\n\n## i) Risks relating to the impact of COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to the Group's customers, suppliers and staff globally. Most jurisdictions in which the Group operates have implemented severe restrictions on the movement of their respective populations, with a resultant significant impact on economic activity in those jurisdictions. These restrictions are being determined by the governments of individual jurisdictions (including through the implementation of emergency powers) and impacts (including the timing of implementation and any subsequent lifting or extension of restrictions) may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and/or within jurisdictions. It remains unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve through 2021 (including whether there will be further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether COVID-19 vaccines approved for use by regulatory authorities will be deployed successfully with desired results, whether further new strains of COVID-19 will emerge and whether, and in what manner, additional restrictions will be imposed and/or existing restrictions extended) and the Group continues to monitor the situation closely.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material impact on businesses around the world and the economic environments in which they operate. There are a number of factors associated with the pandemic and its impact on global economies that could have a material adverse effect on (among other things) the profitability, capital and liquidity of financial institutions such as Barclays.\n\nHowever, despite the COVID-19 contingency plans established by the Group, the ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by disruptions to infrastructure, business processes and technology services, resulting from the unavailability of staff due to illness or the failure of third parties to supply services. This may cause significant customer detriment, costs to reimburse losses incurred by the Group's customers, potential litigation costs (including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions), and reputational damage.\n\nAs these schemes and other financial support schemes provided by national governments (such as job retention and furlough schemes) expire, are withdrawn or are no longer supported, economic growth may be negatively impacted which may impact the Group's results of operations and profitability. In addition, the Group may experience a higher volume of defaults and delinquencies in certain portfolios and may initiate collection and enforcement actions to recover defaulted debts. Where defaulting borrowers are harmed by the Group's conduct, this may give rise to civil legal proceedings, including class actions, regulatory censure, potentially significant fines and other sanctions, and reputational damage. Other legal disputes may also arise between the Group and defaulting borrowers relating to matters such as breaches or enforcement of legal rights or obligations arising under loan and other credit agreements. Adverse findings in any such matters may result in the Group's rights not being enforced as intended. For further details, refer to 'viii) Legal risk and legal, competition and regulatory matters' below.\n\nThe actions taken by various governments and central banks, in particular in the United Kingdom and the United States, may indicate a view on the potential severity of any economic downturn and post-recovery environment, which from a commercial, regulatory and risk perspective could be significantly different to past crises and persist for a prolonged period. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a weakening in gross domestic product (GDP) in most jurisdictions in which the Group operates and an expectation of higher unemployment in those same jurisdictions. These factors all have a significant impact on the modelling of expected credit losses (ECLs) by the Group. As a result, the Group experienced higher ECLs in 2020 compared to prior periods and this trend may continue in 2021. The economic environment remains uncertain and future impairment charges may be subject to further volatility (including from changes to macroeconomic variable forecasts) depending on the longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures and the efficacy of any COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the longer term effectiveness of central bank, government and other support measures. For further details on macroeconomic variables used in the calculation of ECLs, refer to the credit risk performance section. In addition, ECLs may be adversely impacted by increased levels of default for single name exposures in certain sectors directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (such as the oil and gas, retail, airline, and hospitality and leisure sectors).\n\nIn many of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, schemes have been initiated by central banks, national governments and regulators to provide financial support to parts of the economy most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These schemes have been designed and implemented at pace, meaning lenders (including Barclays) continue to address operational issues which have arisen in connection with the implementation of the schemes, including resolving the interaction between the schemes and existing law and regulation. In addition, the full extent of how these schemes will impact the Group's customers and therefore the impact on the Group remains uncertain at this stage. However, certain actions (such as the introduction of payment holidays for various consumer lending products or the cancellation or waiver of fees associated with certain products) may negatively impact the effective interest rate earned on the Group's portfolios and may reduce fee income being earned on certain products and negatively impact the Group's profitability. Furthermore, the introduction of, and participation in, central-bank supported loan and other financing schemes introduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the Group's RWAs, level of impairment and, in turn, capital position (particularly when any transitional relief applied to the calculation of RWAs and impairment expires). This may be exacerbated if the Group is required by any government or regulator to offer forbearance or additional financial relief to borrowers or if the Group is unable to rely on guarantees provided by governments in connection with financial support schemes as a result of the Group's failure to comply with scheme requirements or otherwise.",

Models are, by their nature, imperfect and incomplete representations of reality because they rely on assumptions and inputs, and so they may be subject to errors affecting the accuracy of their outputs and/or misused. This may be exacerbated when dealing with unprecedented scenarios, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the lack of reliable historical reference points and data. For further details on model risk, refer to 'v) Model risk' below.\n\nFurthermore, in order to support lending activity to promote economic growth, governments and/or regulators may limit management's flexibility in managing its business, require the deployment of capital in particular business lines or otherwise restrict or limit capital distributions and capital allocation.\n\nThe disruption to economic activity globally caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the Group's other assets such as goodwill and intangibles, and the value of Barclays PLC's investments in subsidiaries. It could also impact the Group's income due to lower lending and transaction volumes due to volatility or weakness in the capital markets. Other potential risks include credit rating migration which could negatively impact the Group's RWAs and capital position, and potential liquidity stress due to (among other things) increased customer drawdowns, notwithstanding the significant initiatives that governments and central banks have put in place to support funding and liquidity. Furthermore, a significant increase in the utilisation of credit cards by Barclaycard customers could have a negative impact on the Group's RWAs and capital position.\n\nAny and all such events mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, liquidity, capital position and credit ratings (including potential credit rating agency changes of outlooks or ratings), aswell as on the Group's customers, employees and suppliers.\n\n## ii) Business conditions, general economy and geopolitical issues\n\nA deterioration in global or local economic and market conditions may lead to (among other things): (i) deteriorating business, consumer or investor confidence and lower levels of fixed asset investment and productivity growth, which in turn may lead to lower client activity, including lower demand for borrowing from creditworthy customers; (ii) higher default rates, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges as borrowers struggle with the burden of additional debt; (iii) subdued asset prices and payment patterns, including the value of any collateral held by the Group; (iv) mark-to-market losses in trading portfolios resulting from changes in factors such as credit ratings, share prices and solvency of counterparties; and (v) revisions to calculated ECLs leading to increases in impairment allowances. In addition, the Group's ability to borrow from other financial institutions or raise funding from external investors may be affected by deteriorating economic conditions and market disruption.\n\nThe Group's operations are subject to potentially unfavourable global and local economic and market conditions, as well as geopolitical developments, which may have a material effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nGeopolitical events may lead to further financial instability and affect economic growth. In particular:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 in the UK, the decision to leave the European Union (EU) may give rise to further economic and political consequences including for investment and market confidence in the UK and the remainder of EU. See '(iii) The UK's withdrawal from the European Union' below for further details\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 global GDP growth weakened sharply in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst a number of central banks and governments implemented financial stimulus packages to counter the economic impact of the pandemic, recovery has been slower than anticipated and concerns remain as to whether (a) there will be subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, (b) further financial stimulus will be required and/or (c) governments will be required to significantly increase taxation to fund these commitments. All of these factors could adversely affect economic growth, affect specific industries or countries or affect the Group's employees and business operations in affected countries. See 'i) Risks relating to the impact of COVID-19' above for further details\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a significant proportion of the Group's portfolio is located in the US, including a major credit card portfolio and a range of corporate and investment banking exposures. The possibility of significant continued changes in US policy in certain sectors (including trade, healthcare and commodities) may have an impact on the Group's associated portfolios. Stress in the US economy, weakening GDP and the associated exchange rate fluctuations, heightened trade tensions (such as the current dispute between the US and China), an unexpected rise in unemployment and/or an increase in interest rates could lead to increased levels of impairment, resulting in a negative impact on the Group's profitability\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 in China the pace of credit growth remains a concern, given the high level of leverage and despite government and regulatory action. A stronger than expected slowdown could result if authorities fail to appropriately manage growth during the transition from manufacturing towards services and the end of the investment and credit-led boom. Deterioration in emerging markets could affect the Group if it results in higher impairment charges via sovereign or counterparty defaults.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 an escalation in geopolitical tensions or increased use of protectionist measures may negatively impact the Group's business in the affected regions\n\n## iii) The UK's withdrawal from the European Union\n\n## Trade and economic activity between the EU and UK\n\nThere are a number of factors associated with the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nThe EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which provides a new economic and social partnership between the EU and UK (including zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin) came into force provisionally on 1 January 2021.\n\nThe TCA is a new, unprecedented arrangement between the EU and the UK, and there is some uncertainty as to its operation and the manner in which trading arrangements will be enforced by both the EU and the UK.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, the EU and/or the UK can invoke trade remedies (such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers) against each other in certain circumstances under the TCA. Resultant trading disruption may have a significant impact on economic activity in the EU and the UK which (in turn) could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Unstable economic conditions could result in (among other things):\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 increased market volatility (in particular in currencies and interest rates), which could impact the Group's trading book positions and affect the underlying value of assets in the banking book and securities held by the Group for liquidity purposes\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a recession in the UK and/or one or more member states of the EEA in which it operates, with lower growth, higher unemployment and falling property prices, which could lead to increased impairments in relation to a number of the Group's portfolios (including, but not limited to, its UK mortgage portfolio, unsecured lending portfolio (including credit cards) and commercial real estate exposures)\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a credit rating downgrade for one or more members of the Group (either directly or indirectly as a result of a downgrade in the UK sovereign credit ratings), which could significantly increase the Group's cost of and/or reduce its access to funding, widen credit spreads and materially adversely affect the Group's interest margins and liquidity position and/or\n\n## Current provision of financial services\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a widening of credit spreads more generally or reduced investor appetite for the Group's debt securities, which could negatively impact the Group's cost of and/or access to funding.\n\nThe TCA does not cover financial services regulation. Accordingly, UK-based entities within the Group (such as Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC) are no longer able to rely on the European passporting framework for financial services. Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited have put in place new arrangements in the provision of cross-border banking and investment services to customers and counterparties in the EEA (including by servicing EEA clients through the Group's EEA hub (Barclays Bank Ireland PLC), whilst Barclays Bank UK PLC remains focused on UK customers.\n\nThe TCA was accompanied by a Joint Declaration on Financial Services, requiring the parties to agree a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), by March 2021, establishing the framework for cooperation in financial services. The MoU will also cover how to move forward on equivalence determinations between the EU and the UK.\n\nThe Group provides the majority of its cross-border banking and investment services to EEA clients via Barclays Bank Ireland PLC. Additionally, in certain EEA Member States, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited (BCSL) have applied for and received cross-border licences to enable them to continue to conduct a limited range of activities, including accessing EEA trading venues and interdealer trading. As a result of the onshoring of EU legislation in the UK and the exercise of the UK regulators' Temporary Transitional Powers, UK-based entities within the Group are currently subject to substantially the same rules and regulations as prior to the UK's withdrawal from the EU. It is the UK's intention eventually to recast onshored EU legislation as part of UK legislation and PRA and FCA rules, which could result in changes to regulatory requirements in the UK.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the EU and the UK will reach further agreement on equivalence decisions. As a result, equivalence decisions which would enable UK firms to access EEA clients on a cross-border basis for certain markets product, cannot be relied upon to allow UK-based entities within the Group to meet all of the needs of customers and clients based in the EEA. However, there are certain other types of equivalence decisions which are material to the operations of the Group. To date, the EU and the UK have only agreed a temporary position on mutual equivalence in relation to clearing and settlement (CCP equivalence). If the current mutual, temporary equivalence decision in relation to CCP equivalence expires and is not replaced, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business as well as its clients. In addition, HM Treasury has made certain unilateral equivalence decisions, (including under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the removal of such decisions could have a material impact on the operations of the Group.\n\nIf the regulatory regimes for EU and UK financial services change further, or if temporary permissions and equivalence decisions expire, and are not replaced, the provision of crossborder banking and investment services across the Group may become more complex and costly which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business and results of operations and could result in the Group modifying its legal entity, capital and funding structures and business mix, exiting certain business activities altogether or not expanding in areas despite otherwise attractive potential returns. This may also be exacerbated if, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC expands further and, as a result of its growth and importance to the Group and the EEA banking system as a whole, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is made subject to higher capital requirements or restrictions are imposed by regulators on capital allocation and capital distributions by Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.\n\nChanges to interest rates are significant for the Group, especially given the uncertainty as to the direction of interest rates and the pace at which they may change particularly in the Group's main markets of the UK and the US.\n\n## iv) The impact of interest rate changes on the Group's profitability\n\nA continued period of low interest rates and flat yield curves, including any further rate cuts and/or negative interest rates, may affect and continue to put pressure on the Group's net interest margins (the difference between its lending income and borrowing costs) and could adversely affect the profitability and prospects of the Group.\n\nIn addition, changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the value of the securities held in the Group's liquid asset portfolio. Consequently, this could create more volatility than expected through the Group's Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) reserves.\n\nInterest rate rises could positively impact the Group's profitability as retail and corporate business income increases due to margin decompression. However, further increases in interest rates, if larger or more frequent than expected, could lead to generally weaker than expected growth, reduced business confidence and higher unemployment. This, in turn, could cause stress in the lending portfolio and underwriting activity of the Group with resultant higher credit losses driving an increased impairment charge which would most notably impact retail unsecured portfolios and wholesale non-investment grade lending and could have a material effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",

For example, technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. This has allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require the Group to spend more to modify or adapt its products or make additional capital investments in its businesses to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies.\n\nThe Group operates in a highly competitive environment (in particular, in the UK and US) in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and current economic conditions. The Group expects that competition in the financial services industry will continue to be intense and may have a material adverse effect on the Group's future business, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for the Group's products and services, which could reduce the Group's revenues and profitability, or may cause the Group to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits, bank accounts and mortgage lending. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of the Group's businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect the Group's ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce the Group's revenues.\n\n## vi) Regulatory change agenda and impact on business model\n\nThere are several significant pieces of legislation and areas of focus which will require significant management attention, cost and resource, including:\n\nThe Group remains subject to ongoing significant levels of regulatory change and scrutiny in many of the countries in which it operates (including, in particular, the UK and the US). As a result, regulatory risk will remain a focus for senior management. Furthermore, a more intensive regulatory approach and enhanced requirements together with the potential lack of international regulatory co-ordination as enhanced supervisory standards are developed and implemented may adversely affect the Group's business, capital and risk management strategies and/or may result in the Group deciding to modify its legal entity, capital and funding structures and business mix, or to exit certain business activities altogether or not to expand in areas despite otherwise attractive potential.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 changes in prudential requirements may impact minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) (including requirements for internal MREL), leverage, liquidity or funding requirements, applicable buffers and/or add-ons to such minimum requirements and risk weighted assets calculation methodologies all as may be set by international, EU or national authorities. Such or similar changes to prudential requirements or additional supervisory and prudential expectations, either individually or in aggregate, may result in, among other things, a need for further management actions to meet the changed requirements, such as:\n- -restricting distributions on capital instruments\n- -increasing capital, MREL or liquidity resources, reducing leverage and risk weighted assets\n- -modifying the terms of outstanding capital instruments\n- -changing the Group's business mix or exiting other businesses and/or\n- -modifying legal entity structure (including with regard to issuance and deployment of capital, MREL and funding)\n- -undertaking other actions to strengthen the Group's position.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the derivatives market has been the subject of particular focus for regulators in recent years across the G20 countries and beyond, with regulations introduced which require the reporting and clearing of standardised over the counter (OTC) derivatives and the mandatory margining of non-cleared OTC derivatives. These regulations may increase costs for market participants, as well as reduce liquidity in the derivatives markets, in particular, if there are areas of overlapping or conflicting regulation. More broadly, changes to the regulatory framework (in particular, the review of the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the implementation of the Benchmarks Regulation) could entail significant costs for market participants and may have a significant impact on certain markets in which the Group operates\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Group and certain of its members are subject to supervisory stress testing exercises in a number of jurisdictions. These exercises currently include the programmes of the Bank of England, the European Banking Authority (EBA), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Failure to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests, or the failure by regulators to approve the stress test results and capital plans of the Group, could result in the Group or certain of its members being required to enhance their capital position, limit capital distributions or position additional capital in specific subsidiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the regulatory supervision of, and regulations applicable to, the Group, see the Supervision and regulation section.\n\n## vii) The impact of climate change on the Group's business\n\nPhysical risks from climate change arise from a number of factors and relate to specific weather events and longer-term shifts in the climate. The nature and timing of extreme weather events are uncertain but they are increasing in frequency and their impact on the economy is predicted to be more acute in the future.\n\nThe risks associated with climate change are subject to rapidly increasing societal, regulatory and political focus, both in the UK and internationally. Embedding climate risk into the Group's risk framework in line with regulatory expectations, and adapting the Group's operations and business strategy to address the financial risks resulting from both: (i) the physical risk of climate change; and (ii) the risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy, could have a significant impact on the Group's business.",

        "page_content": "The potential impact on the economy includes,\n\nAs the economy transitions to a low-carbon economy, financial institutions such as the Group may face significant and rapid developments in stakeholder expectations, policy, law and regulation which could impact the lending activities the Group undertakes, as well as the risks associated with its lending portfolios, and the value of the Group's financial assets. As sentiment towards climate change shifts and societal preferences change, the Group may face greater scrutiny of the type of business it conducts, adverse media coverage and reputational damage, which may in turn impact customer demand for the Group's products, returns on certain business activities and the value of certain assets and trading positions resulting in impairment charges.\n\nbut is not limited to, lower GDP growth, higher unemployment and significant changes in asset prices and profitability of industries. Damage to the properties and operations of borrowers could impair asset values and the creditworthiness of customers leading to increased default rates, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in the Group's portfolios. In addition, the Group's premises and resilience may also suffer physical damage due to weather events leading to increased costs for the Group.\n\nIn addition, the impacts of physical and transition climate risks can lead to second order connected risks, which have the potential to affect the Group's retail and wholesale portfolios. The impacts of climate change may increase losses for those sectors sensitive to the effects of physical and transition risks. Any subsequent increase in defaults and rising unemployment could create recessionary pressures, which may lead to wider deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Group's clients, higher ECLs, and increased charge-offs and defaults among retail customers.\n\nIf the Group does not adequately embed risks associated with climate change into its risk framework to appropriately measure, manage and disclose the various financial and operational risks it faces as a result of climate change, or fails to adapt its strategy and business model to the changing regulatory requirements and market expectations on a timely basis, it may have a material and adverse impact on the Group's level of business growth, competitiveness, profitability, capital requirements, cost of funding, and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to climate change, see the climate change risk management section.\n\n## viii) Impact of benchmark interest rate reforms on the Group\n\nUncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, the availability and/or suitability of alternative 'risk-free' reference rates and other reforms may adversely affect a broad range of transactions (including any securities, loans and derivatives which use LIBOR to determine the amount of interest payable that are included in the Group's financial assets and liabilities) that use these reference rates and indices and introduce a number of risks for the Group, including, but not limited to:\n\nFor several years, global regulators and central banks have been driving international efforts to reform key benchmark interest rates and indices, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which are used to determine the amounts payable under a wide range of transactions and make them more reliable and robust. This has resulted in significant changes to the methodology and operation of certain benchmarks and indices, the adoption of alternative 'risk-free' reference rates and the proposed discontinuation of certain reference rates (including LIBOR), with further changes anticipated, including UK, EU and US legislative proposals to deal with 'tough legacy' contracts that cannot convert into or cannot add fall-back risk-free reference rates. The consequences of reform are unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on any financial instruments linked to, or referencing, any of these benchmark interest rates.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Conduct risk: in undertaking actions to transition away from using certain reference rates (such as LIBOR) to new alternative, risk-free rates, the Group faces conduct risks. These may lead to customer complaints, regulatory sanctions or reputational impact if the Group is considered to be (among other things) (i) undertaking market activities that are manipulative or create a false or misleading impression, (ii) misusing sensitive information or not identifying or appropriately managing or mitigating conflicts of interest, (iii) providing customers with inadequate advice, misleading information, unsuitable products or unacceptable service, (iv) not taking a consistent approach to remediation for customers in similar circumstances, (v) unduly delaying the communication and migration activities in relation to client exposure, leaving them insufficient time to prepare or (vi) colluding or inappropriately sharing information with competitors\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Financial risks: the valuation of certain of the Group's financial assets and liabilities may change. Moreover, transitioning to alternative 'risk-free' reference rates may impact the ability of members of the Group to calculate and model amounts receivable by them on certain financial assets and determine the amounts payable on certain financial liabilities (such as debt securities issued by them) because currently alternative 'risk-free' reference rates (such as the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)) are look-back rates whereas term rates (such as LIBOR) allow borrowers to calculate at the start of any interest period exactly how much is payable at the end of such interest period. This may have a material adverse effect on the Group's cash flows\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Operational risk: changes to existing reference rates and indices, discontinuation of any reference rate or index and transition to alternative 'risk-free' reference rates may require changes to the Group's IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure, operational processes, and controls. In addition, if any reference rate or index (such as LIBOR) is no longer available to calculate amounts payable, the Group may incur additional expenses in amending documentation for new and existing transactions and/or effecting the transition from the original reference rate or index to a new reference rate or index and\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Pricing risk: changes to existing reference rates and indices, discontinuation of any reference rate or indices and transition to alternative 'risk-free' reference rates may impact the pricing mechanisms used by the Group on certain transactions\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Accounting risk: an inability to apply hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS could lead to increased volatility in the Group's financial results and performance.\n\nAny of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the impacts of benchmark interest rate reforms on the Group, see Note 41.",

These laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends and distributions to Barclays PLC by its subsidiaries and any other entities in which it holds an investment from time to time, which could restrict Barclays PLC's ability to meet its obligations and/or to pay dividends to ordinary shareholders.\n\nBarclays PLC is a holding company and its principal sources of income are, and are expected to continue to be, distributions (in the form of dividends and interest payments) from operating subsidiaries which also hold the principal assets of the Group. As a separate legal entity, Barclays PLC relies on such distributions in order to be able to meet its obligations as they fall due (including its payment obligations with respect to its debt securities) and to create distributable reserves for payment of dividends to ordinary shareholders.\n\n## x) Application of resolution measures and stabilisation powers under the Banking Act\n\nUnder the Banking Act 2009, as amended (Banking Act), substantial powers are granted to the Bank of England (or, in certain circumstances, HM Treasury), in consultation with the PRA, the FCA and HM Treasury, as appropriate, as part of a special resolution regime (SRR). These powers enable the relevant UK resolution authority to implement resolution measures and stabilisation options with respect to a UK bank or investment firm and certain of its affiliates (currently including Barclays PLC) (each, a relevant entity) in circumstances in which the relevant UK resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met.\n\nThe SRR consists of five stabilisation options: (i) private sector transfer of all or part of the business or shares of the relevant entity, (ii) transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity to a 'bridge bank' established by the Bank of England, (iii) transfer to an asset management vehicle wholly or partly owned by HM Treasury or the Bank of England, (iv) the cancellation, transfer or dilution of the relevant entities' equity (including Barclays PLC's ordinary share capital) and write-down or conversion of the relevant entity's capital instruments and liabilities (the bail-in tool) and (v) temporary public ownership (i.e. nationalisation).\n\nShareholders should assume that, in a resolution situation, public financial support will only be available to a relevant entity as a last resort after the relevant UK resolution authorities have assessed and used, to the maximum extent practicable, the resolution tools, including the bail-in tool (the Bank of England's preferred approach for the resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC). The exercise of any of such powers under the Banking Act or any suggestion of any such exercise could materially adversely affect the value of Barclays PLC ordinary shares and could lead to shareholders losing some or all of their investment.\n\nIn addition, the relevant UK resolution authority may, in certain circumstances, in accordance with the Banking Act require the permanent write-down or conversion into equity of any outstanding Tier 1 capital instruments, Tier 2 capital instruments and internal MREL prior to the exercise of any stabilisation option (including the bail-in tool). Any such action could result in the dilution of Barclays PLC's ordinary share capital.\n\nIn addition, any safeguards within the Banking Act (such as the 'no creditor worse off' principle) may not result in compensation to shareholders that is equivalent to the full losses incurred by them in the resolution and there can be no assurance that shareholders would recover such compensation promptly.\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks impacting individual principal risks\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully honour their obligations to members of the Group, including the whole and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral and other receivables.\n\n## i) Credit risk\n\n## a) Impairment\n\nMeasurement involves complex judgement and impairment charges could be volatile, particularly under stressed conditions. Unsecured products with longer expected lives, such as credit cards, are the most impacted. Taking into account the transitional regime, the capital treatment on the increased reserves has the potential to adversely impact the Group's regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe introduction of the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, resulted in impairment loss allowances that are recognised earlier, on a more forward-looking basis and on a broader scope of financial instruments, and may continue to have a material impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nIn addition, the move from incurred losses to ECLs has the potential to impact the Group's performance under stressed economic conditions or regulatory stress tests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, refer to Note 1.\n\n## b) Specific sectors and concentrations\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 UK retail, hospitality and leisure. Softening demand, rising costs and a structural shift to online shopping is fuelling pressure on the UK High Street and other sectors heavily reliant on consumer discretionary spending. As these sectors continue to reposition themselves, the trend represents a potential risk in the Group's UK corporate portfolio from the perspective of its interactions with both retailers and their landlords\n\nThe Group is subject to risks arising from changes in credit quality and recovery rates of loans and advances due from borrowers and counterparties in any specific portfolio. Any deterioration in credit quality could lead to lower recoverability and higher impairment in a specific sector. The following are areas of uncertainties to the Group's portfolio which could have a material impact on performance:",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 \u25a0 consumer affordability has remained a key area of focus, particularly in unsecured lending. Macroeconomic factors, such as rising unemployment, that impact a customer's ability to service debt payments could lead to increased arrears in both unsecured and secured products\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 leverage finance underwriting. The Group takes on sub-investment grade underwriting exposure, including single name risk, particularly in the US and Europe. The Group is exposed to credit events and market volatility during the underwriting period. Any adverse events during this period may potentially result in loss for the Group, or an increased capital requirement should there be a need to hold the exposure for an extended period\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 UK real estate market. UK property represents a significant portion of the overall Group retail and corporate credit exposure. In 2020, property prices fluctuated significantly. In the first half of 2020 the Group's retail exposure experienced a suppressed UK real estate market due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst the second half of 2020 saw increased activity as financial support schemes and a temporary stamp duty cut took effect. However, there can be no assurance that the recovery in the UK real estate market will continue in 2021 especially as the longer term macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are felt, financial support schemes are withdrawn and stamp duty cuts are reversed, and growth across the UK has slowed, particularly in London and the South East where the Group has a high exposure. The Group's corporate exposure is vulnerable to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 stress, with particular weakness in retail property as a result of reduced rent collections and residential development. The Group is at risk of increased impairment from a material fall in property prices\n\n## \u25a0 \u25a0 Italian mortgage and wholesale exposure.\n\n- The Group is exposed to a decline in the Italian economic environment through a mortgage portfolio in run-off and positions to wholesale customers. The Italian economy was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and recovery has been slower than anticipated. Should the Italian economy deteriorate further or any recovery take longer to materialise, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations including, but not limited to, increased credit losses and higher impairment charges\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Oil & Gas sector. The Group's corporate credit exposure includes companies whose performance is dependent on the oil and gas sector. Weaker demand for energy products, in particular as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with a sustained period of lower energy prices has led to the erosion of balance sheet strength, particularly for higher cost producers and those businesses who supply goods and services to the oil and gas sector. Any recovery from the drop in demand is likely to remain volatile and energy prices could remain subdued at low levels for the foreseeable future, below the break-even point for some companies. Furthermore, in the longer term, costs associated with the transition towards renewable sources of energy may place great demands on companies that the Group has exposure to globally. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition through increased impairment charges.\n\nThe Group also has large individual exposures to single name counterparties, both in its lending activities and in its financial services and trading activities, including transactions in derivatives and transactions with brokers, central clearing houses, dealers, other banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. The default of such counterparties could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets. In addition, where such counterparty risk has been mitigated by taking collateral, credit risk may remain high if the collateral held cannot be realised, or has to be liquidated at prices which are insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. Any such defaults could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results due to, for example, increased credit losses and higher impairment charges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to credit risk, see the credit risk management and credit risk performance sections.\n\n## ii) Market risk\n\nEconomic and financial market uncertainties remain elevated, as the path of the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently difficult to predict. Further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, deployment of COVID-19 vaccines not being as successful as desired, intensifying social unrest that weighs on market sentiment, and deteriorating trade and geopolitical tensions are some of the factors that could heighten market risks for the Group's portfolios.\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from potential adverse change in the value of the Group's assets and liabilities from fluctuation in market variables including, but not limited to, interest rates, foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities and asset correlations.\n\nIn addition, the Group's trading business is generally exposed to a prolonged period of elevated asset price volatility, particularly if it negatively affects the depth of marketplace liquidity. Such a scenario could impact the Group's ability to execute client trades and may also result in lower client flow-driven income and/or market-based losses on its existing portfolio of market risks. These can include having to absorb higher hedging costs from rebalancing risks that need to be managed dynamically as market levels and their associated volatilities change.\n\nIt is difficult to predict changes in market conditions, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to market risk, see the market risk management and market risk performance sections.\n\n## iii) Treasury and capital risk\n\n## a) Liquidity risk\n\nThere are three primary types of treasury and capital risk faced by the Group:\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets. This could cause the Group to fail to meet regulatory liquidity standards or be unable to support day-to-day banking activities. Key liquidity risks that the Group faces include:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the stability of the Group's current funding profile: in particular, that part which is based on accounts and deposits payable on demand or at short notice, could be affected by the Group failing to preserve the current level of customer and investor confidence. The Group also regularly accesses the money and capital markets to provide short-term and long-term funding to support its operations. Several factors, including adverse macroeconomic conditions, adverse outcomes in conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters and loss of confidence by investors, counterparties and/or customers in the Group, can affect the ability of the Group to access the capital markets and/or the cost and other terms upon which the Group is able to obtain market funding",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks continued\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 credit rating changes and the impact on funding costs: rating agencies regularly review credit ratings given to Barclays PLC and certain members of the Group. Credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including some which are not within the Group's control (such as political and regulatory developments, changes in rating methodologies, macroeconomic conditions and the sovereign credit ratings of the countries in which the Group operates).\n\n## b) Capital risk\n\nWhilst the impact of a credit rating change will depend on a number of factors (including the type of issuance and prevailing market conditions), any reductions in a credit rating (in particular, any downgrade below investment grade) may affect the Group's access to the money or capital markets and/or terms on which the Group is able to obtain market funding, increase costs of funding and credit spreads, reduce the size of the Group's deposit base, trigger additional collateral or other requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements or limit the range of counterparties who are willing to enter into transactions with the Group. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nCapital risk is the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments or stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory stress testing purposes). This includes the risk from the Group's pension plans. Key capital risks that the Group faces include:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 failure to meet prudential capital requirements: this could lead to the Group being unable to support some or all of its business activities, a failure to pass regulatory stress tests, increased cost of funding due to deterioration in investor appetite or credit ratings, restrictions on distributions including the ability to meet dividend targets, and/or the need to take additional measures to strengthen the Group's capital or leverage position\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 adverse changes in FX rates impacting capital ratios: the Group has capital resources, risk weighted assets and leverage exposures denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact the Sterling equivalent value of these items. As a result, the Group's regulatory capital ratios are sensitive to foreign currency movements. Failure to appropriately manage the Group's balance sheet to take account of foreign currency movements could result in an adverse impact on the Group's regulatory capital and leverage ratios\n\n## c) Interest rate risk in the banking book\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 adverse movements in the pension fund: adverse movements in pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension schemes could result in deficits on a funding and/or accounting basis. This could lead to the Group making substantial additional contributions to its pension plans and/or a deterioration in its capital position. Under IAS 19, the liabilities discount rate is derived from the yields of high quality corporate bonds. Therefore, the valuation of the Group's defined benefits schemes would be adversely affected by a prolonged fall in the discount rate due to a persistent low interest rate and/or credit spread environment. Inflation is another significant risk driver to the pension fund as the liabilities are adversely impacted by an increase in long-term inflation expectations.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities. The Group's hedge programmes for interest rate risk in the banking book rely on behavioural assumptions and, as a result, the success of the hedging strategy cannot be guaranteed. A potential mismatch in the balance or duration of the hedge assumptions could lead to earnings deterioration. A decline in interest rates in G3 currencies may also compress net interest margin on retail portfolios. In addition, the Group's liquid asset portfolio is exposed to potential capital and/or income volatility due to movements in market rates and prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to treasury and capital risk, see the treasury and capital risk management and treasury and capital risk performance sections.\n\n## iv) Operational risk\n\n## a) Operational resilience\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks. Examples include:\n\nThe Group functions in a highly competitive market, with market participants that expect consistent and smooth business processes. The loss of or disruption to business processing is a material inherent risk within the Group and across the financial services industry, whether arising through impacts on the Group's technology systems, real estate services including its retail branch network, or availability of personnel or services supplied by third parties. Failure to build resilience and recovery capabilities into business processes or into the services of technology, real estate or suppliers on which the Group's business processes depend, may result in significant customer detriment, costs to reimburse losses incurred by the Group's customers, and reputational damage.\n\nCyberattacks continue to be a global threat that is inherent across all industries, with a spike in both number and severity of attacks observed recently. The financial sector remains a primary target for cybercriminals, hostile nation states, opportunists and hacktivists. The Group, like other financial institutions, experiences numerous attempts to compromise its cybersecurity.\n\n## b) Cyberattacks\n\nThe Group dedicates significant resources to reducing cybersecurity risks, but it cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks. Malicious actors are increasingly sophisticated in their methods, seeking to steal money, gain unauthorised access to, destroy or manipulate data, and disrupt operations, and some of their attacks may not be recognised until launched, such as zero-day attacks that are launched before patches and defences can be readied. Cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and target the Group in numerous ways, including attacks on networks, systems, or devices used by the Group or parties such as service providers and other suppliers, counterparties, employees, contractors, customers or clients, presenting the Group with a vast and complex defence perimeter. Moreover, the Group does not have direct control over the cybersecurity of the systems of its clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers and suppliers, limiting the Group's ability to effectively defend against certain threats.",

        "page_content": "A failure in the Group's adherence to its cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, employee malfeasance, and human, governance or technological error could also compromise the Group's ability to successfully defend against cyberattacks. Furthermore, certain legacy technologies that are at or approaching end-of-life may not be able to be able to maintained to acceptable levels of security. The Group has experienced cybersecurity incidents and near-misses in the past, and it is inevitable that additional incidents will occur in the future. Cybersecurity risks will continue to increase, due to factors such as the increasing demand across the industry and customer expectations for continued expansion of services delivered over the Internet; increasing reliance on Internetbased products, applications and data storage; and changes in ways of working by the Group's employees, contractors, and third party service providers and suppliers and their subcontractors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad actors have taken advantage of remote working practices and modified customer behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploiting the situation in novel ways that may elude defences.\n\nRegulators worldwide continue to recognise cybersecurity as an increasing systemic risk to the financial sector and have highlighted the need for financial institutions to improve their monitoring and control of, and resilience to cyberattacks. A successful cyberattack may, therefore, result in significant regulatory fines on the Group.\n\nCommon types of cyberattacks include deployment of malware, including destructive ransomware; denial of service and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; infiltration via business email compromise, including phishing, or via social engineering, including vishing and smishing; automated attacks using botnets; and credential validation or stuffing attacks using login and password pairs from unrelated breaches. A successful cyberattack of any type has the potential to cause serious harm to the Group or its clients and customers, including exposure to potential contractual liability, litigation, regulatory or other government action, loss of existing or potential customers, damage to the Group's brand and reputation, and other financial loss. The impact of a successful cyberattack also is likely to include operational consequences (such as unavailability of services, networks, systems, devices or data) remediation of which could come at significant cost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to cyberattacks, see the operational risk performance section.\n\n## c) New and emergent technology\n\nIntroducing new forms of technology, however, has the potential to increase inherent risk. Failure to evaluate, actively manage and closely monitor risk exposure during all phases of business development could introduce new vulnerabilities and security flaws and have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nTechnology is fundamental to the Group's business and the financial services industry. Technological advancements present opportunities to develop new and innovative ways of doing business across the Group, with new solutions being developed both in-house and in association with third party companies. For example, payment services and securities, futures and options trading are increasingly occurring electronically, both on the Group's own systems and through other alternative systems, and becoming automated. Whilst increased use of electronic payment and trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could significantly reduce the Group's cost base, it may, conversely, reduce the commissions, fees and margins made by the Group on these transactions which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## d) External fraud\n\nThe nature of fraud is wide-ranging and continues to evolve, as criminals continually seek opportunities to target the Group's business activities and exploit changes to customer behaviour and product and channel use (such as the increased use of digital products and enhanced online services) or exploit new products (such as loans provided under the UK Government's Bounce Back Loan Scheme and the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, which have been designed to support customers and clients during the COVID-19 pandemic). Fraud attacks can be very sophisticated and are often orchestrated by highly organised crime groups who use ever more sophisticated techniques to target customers and clients directly to obtain confidential or personal information that can be used to commit fraud. The UK market has also seen significant growth in 'scams' where the Group takes increased levels of liability as part of a voluntary code to provide additional safeguards to customers and clients who are tricked into making payments to fraudsters. The impact from fraud can lead to customer detriment, financial losses (including the reimbursement of losses incurred by customers), loss of business, missed business opportunities and reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## e) Data management and information protection\n\nThe international nature of both the Group's business and its IT infrastructure also means that personal information may be available in countries other than those from where it originated. Accordingly, the Group needs to ensure that its collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, which could: (i) increase the Group's compliance and operating costs; (ii) impact the development of new products or services, impact the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers; (iii) demand significant oversight by the Group's management; and (iv) require the Group to review some elements of the structure of its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways.\n\nThe Group holds and processes large volumes of data, including personally identifiable information, intellectual property, and financial data and the Group's businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)). The protected parties can include: (i) the Group's clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers; (ii) clients and customers of the Group's clients and customers; (iii) employees and prospective employees; and (iv) employees of the Group's suppliers, counterparties and other external parties.\n\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of the Group's measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could expose the Group to the risk of loss or unavailability of data or data integrity issues and/or cause the Group to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce the Group's revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by the Group to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to potential contractual liability, litigation, regulatory or other government action (including significant regulatory fines) and require changes to certain operations or practices which could also inhibit the Group's development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers. Any of these events could damage the Group's reputation and otherwise materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",

An algorithmic error could result in erroneous or duplicated transactions, a system outage, or impact the Group's pricing abilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and reputation.\n\nThe Group's businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. As the Group's customer base and geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing, maintaining and upgrading operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions increases, as well as the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. Furthermore, events that are wholly or partially beyond the Group's control, such as a spike in transaction volume, could adversely affect the Group's ability to process transactions or provide banking and payment services.\n\nProcessing errors could result in the Group, among other things, (i) failing to provide information, services and liquidity to clients and counterparties in a timely manner; (ii) failing to settle and/or confirm transactions; (iii) causing funds transfers, capital markets trades and/or other transactions to be executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences; and (iv) adversely affecting financial, trading or currency markets. Any of these events could materially disadvantage the Group's customers, clients and counterparties (including them suffering financial loss) and/or result in a loss of confidence in the Group which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## h) Supplier exposure\n\n## i) Estimates and judgements relating to critical accounting policies and capital disclosures\n\nThe Group depends on suppliers for the provision of many of its services and the development of technology. Whilst the Group depends on suppliers, it remains fully accountable for any risk arising from the actions of suppliers. The dependency on suppliers and sub-contracting of outsourced services introduces concentration risk where the failure of specific suppliers could have an impact on the Group's ability to continue to provide material services to its customers. Failure to adequately manage supplier risk could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies and judgements to be made in accordance with IFRS. Regulatory returns and capital disclosures are prepared in accordance with the relevant capital reporting requirements and also require assumptions and estimates to be made. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements, include credit impairment charges, taxes, fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions and post-retirement benefits, and provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters (see the notes to the audited financial statements for further details). There is a risk that if the judgement exercised, or the estimates or assumptions used, subsequently turn out to be incorrect, this could result in material losses to the Group, beyond what was anticipated or provided for. Further development of accounting standards and capital interpretations could also materially impact the Group's results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nThe Group is required to comply with the domestic and international tax laws and practice of all countries in which it has business operations. There is a risk that the Group could suffer losses due to additional tax charges, other financial costs or reputational damage as a result of failing to comply with such laws and practice, or by failing to manage its tax affairs in an appropriate manner, with much of this risk attributable to the international structure of the Group. In addition, increasing reporting and disclosure requirements around the world and the digitisation of the administration of tax has potential to increase the Group's tax compliance obligations further.\n\n## j) Tax risk\n\n## k) Ability to hire and retain appropriately qualified employees\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, the Group requires diversified and specialist skilled colleagues. The Group's ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse mix of talent is key to the delivery of its core business activity and strategy. This is impacted by a range of external and internal factors, such as the UK's decision to leave the EU and the enhanced individual accountability applicable to the banking industry. Failure to attract or prevent the departure of appropriately qualified and skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, this may result in disruption to service which could in turn lead to disenfranchising certain customer groups, customer detriment and reputational damage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to operational risk, see the operational risk management and operational risk performance sections.\n\n## v) Model risk\n\nModels are, by their nature, imperfect and incomplete representations of reality because they rely on assumptions and inputs, and so they may be subject to errors affecting the accuracy of their outputs and/or misused. This may be exacerbated when dealing with unprecedented scenarios, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the lack of reliable historical reference points and data. For instance, the quality of the data used in models across the Group has a material impact on the accuracy and completeness of its risk and financial metrics. Model errors or misuse may result in (among other things) the Group making inappropriate business decisions and/or inaccuracies or errors being identified in the Group's risk management and regulatory reporting processes. This could result in significant financial loss, imposition of additional capital requirements, enhanced regulatory supervision and reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nModel risk is the risk of potential adverse consequences from financial assessments or decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. The Group relies on models to support a broad range of business and risk management activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures (including the calculation of impairment), conducting stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, supporting new business acceptance and risk and reward evaluation, managing client assets, and meeting reporting requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to model risk, see the model risk management and model risk performance sections.",

        "page_content": "## vi) Conduct risk\n\n## a) Employee misconduct\n\nConduct risk is the risk of detriment to customers, clients, market integrity, effective competition or the Group from the inappropriate supply of financial services, including instances of wilful or negligent misconduct. This risk could manifest itself in a variety of ways:\n\nThe Group's businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with its policies and standards and instances of wilful and negligent misconduct by employees, all of which could result in potential customer and client detriment, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or sanctions), increased operation and compliance costs, redress or remediation or reputational damage which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Examples of employee misconduct which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business include (i) employees improperly selling or marketing the Group's products and services; (ii) employees engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorised trading; or (iii) employees misappropriating confidential or proprietary information belonging to the Group, its customers or third parties. These risks may be exacerbated in circumstances where the Group is unable to rely on physical oversight and supervision of employees (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic where employees have worked remotely).\n\nThe Group must ensure that its customers, particularly those that are vulnerable, are able to make well-informed decisions on how best to use the Group's financial services and understand that they are appropriately protected if something goes wrong. Poor customer outcomes can result from the failure to: (i) communicate fairly and clearly with customers; (ii) provide services in a timely and fair manner; and (iii) undertake appropriate activity to address customer detriment, including the adherence to regulatory and legal requirements on complaint handling. The Group is at risk of financial loss and reputational damage as a result.\n\n## b) Customer engagement\n\n## c) Product design and review risk\n\n## d) Financial crime\n\nProducts and services must meet the needs of clients, customers, markets and the Group throughout their life cycle, However, there is a risk that the design and review of the Group's products and services fail to reasonably consider and address potential or actual negative outcomes, which may result in customer detriment, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or sanctions), redress and remediation and reputational damage. Both the design and review of products and services are a key area of focus for regulators and the Group, and this focus is set to continue in 2021.\n\nThe Group may be adversely affected if it fails to effectively mitigate the risk that third parties or its employees facilitate, or that its products and services are used to facilitate, financial crime (money laundering, terrorist financing, breaches of economic and financial sanctions, bribery and corruption, and the facilitation of tax evasion). UK and US regulations covering financial institutions continue to focus on combating financial crime. Failure to comply may lead to enforcement action by the Group's regulators, including severe penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and prospects.\n\nRegulators around the world continue to emphasise the importance of culture and personal accountability and enforce the adoption of adequate internal reporting and whistleblowing procedures to help to promote appropriate conduct and drive positive outcomes for customers, colleagues, clients and markets. The requirements and expectations of the UK Senior Managers Regime, Certification Regime and Conduct Rules have reinforced additional accountabilities for individuals across the Group with an increased focus on governance and rigour. Failure to meet these requirements and expectations may lead to regulatory sanctions, both for the individuals and the Group.\n\n## e) Regulatory focus on culture and accountability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to conduct risk, see the conduct risk management and conduct risk performance sections.\n\n## vii) Reputation risk\n\nAny material lapse in standards of integrity, compliance, customer service or operating efficiency may represent a potential reputation risk. Stakeholder expectations constantly evolve, and so reputation risk is dynamic and varies between geographical regions, groups and individuals. A risk arising in one business area can have an adverse effect upon the Group's overall reputation and any one transaction, investment or event (in the perception of key stakeholders) can reduce trust in the Group's integrity and competence. The Group's association with sensitive topics and sectors has been, and in some instances continues to be, an area of concern for stakeholders, including (i) the financing of, and investments in, businesses which operate in sectors that are sensitive because of their relative carbon intensity or local environmental impact; (ii) potential association with human rights violations (including combating modern slavery) in the Group's operations or supply chain and by clients and customers; and (iii) the financing of businesses which manufacture and export military and riot control goods and services.\n\nReputation risk is the risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, decision or business relationship will reduce trust in the Group's integrity and/or competence.\n\nReputation risk could also arise from negative public opinion about the actual, or perceived, manner in which the Group conducts its business activities, or the Group's financial performance, as well as actual or perceived practices in banking and the financial services industry generally. Modern technologies, in particular, online social media channels and other broadcast tools that facilitate communication with large audiences in short time frames and with minimal costs, may significantly enhance and accelerate the distribution and effect of damaging information and allegations. Negative public opinion may adversely affect the Group's ability to retain and attract customers, in particular, corporate and retail depositors, and to retain and motivate staff, and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nIn addition to the above, reputation risk has the potential to arise from operational issues or conduct matters which cause detriment to customers, clients, market integrity, effective competition or the Group (see 'iv) Operational risk' above).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to reputation risk, see the reputation risk management and reputation risk performance sections.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks continued\n\n## viii) Legal risk and legal, competition and regulatory matters\n\nA breach of applicable legislation and/or regulations by the Group or its employees could result in criminal prosecution, regulatory censure, potentially significant fines and other sanctions in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Where clients, customers or other third parties are harmed by the Group's conduct, this may also give rise to civil legal proceedings, including class actions. Other legal disputes may also arise between the Group and third parties relating to matters such as breaches or enforcement of legal rights or obligations arising under contracts, statutes or common law. Adverse findings in any such matters may result in the Group being liable to third parties or may result in the Group's rights not being enforced as intended.\n\nThe Group conducts activities in a highly regulated global market which exposes it and its employees to legal risk arising from (i) the multitude of laws and regulations that apply to the businesses it operates, which are highly dynamic, may vary between jurisdictions, and are often unclear in their application to particular circumstances especially in new and emerging areas; and (ii) the diversified and evolving nature of the Group's businesses and business practices. In each case, this exposes the Group and its employees to the risk of loss or the imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of members of the Group to meet their respective legal obligations, including legal or contractual requirements. Legal risk may arise in relation to any number of the material existing and emerging risks identified above.\n\nDetails of legal, competition and regulatory matters to which the Group is currently exposed are set out in Note 26. In addition to matters specifically described in Note 26, the Group is engaged in various other legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Group is also subject to requests for information, investigations and other reviews by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with business activities in which the Group is, or has been, engaged.\n\nThe outcome of legal, competition and regulatory matters, both those to which the Group is currently exposed and any others which may arise in the future, is difficult to predict. In connection with such matters, the Group may incur significant expense, regardless of the ultimate outcome, and any such matters could expose the Group to any of the following outcomes: substantial monetary damages, settlements and/or fines; remediation of affected customers and clients; other penalties and injunctive relief; additional litigation; criminal prosecution; the loss of any existing agreed protection from prosecution; regulatory restrictions on the Group's business operations including the withdrawal of authorisations; increased regulatory compliance requirements or changes to laws or regulations; suspension of operations; public reprimands; loss of significant assets or business; a negative effect on the Group's reputation; loss of confidence by investors, counterparties, clients and/or customers; risk of credit rating agency downgrades; potential negative impact on the availability and/or cost of funding and liquidity; and/or dismissal or resignation of key individuals. In light of the uncertainties involved in legal, competition and regulatory matters, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters (including formerly active matters or those arising after the date of this Annual Report) will not have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",

In the entities, business risk committees (attended by the first line) monitor and review the credit risk profile of each business unit where the most material issues are escalated to the Retail Credit Risk Management Committee, Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee and Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nWholesale and retail portfolios are managed separately to reflect the differing nature of the assets; wholesale balances tend to be larger and are managed on an individual basis, while retail balances are greater in number but lesser in value and are, therefore, managed in aggregated segments.\n\nThe responsibilities of the credit risk management teams in the businesses, the sanctioning team and other shared services include: sanctioning new credit agreements (principally wholesale); setting strategies for approval of transactions (principally retail); setting risk appetite; monitoring risk against limits and other parameters; maintaining robust processes, data gathering, quality, storage and reporting methods for effective credit risk management; performing effective turnaround and workout scenarios for wholesale portfolios via dedicated restructuring and recoveries teams; maintaining robust collections and recovery processes/units for retail portfolios; and review and validation of credit risk measurement models. The credit risk management teams in each legal entity are accountable to the relevant Legal Entity CRO, who reports to the Group CRO.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nFor wholesale portfolios, credit risk managers are organised in sanctioning teams by geography, industry and/or product. In wholesale portfolios, credit risk approval is undertaken by experienced credit risk professionals operating within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, with only the most senior credit officers assigned the higher levels of delegated authority. The largest credit exposures, which are outside the Risk Sanctioning Unit or Risk Distribution Committee authority, require the support of a legal entity Senior Credit Officer. For exposures in excess of the legal entity Senior Credit Officer's authority, approval by Group Senior Credit Officer/Board Risk Committee is also required. The Group Credit Risk Committee, attended by legal entity Senior Credit Officers, provides a formal mechanism for the Group Senior Credit Officer to exercise the highest level of credit authority over the most material Group single name exposures.\n\nThe Group employs a range of techniques and strategies to actively mitigate credit risks. These can broadly be divided into three types:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 collateral\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 netting and set-off\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 risk transfer.\n\n## Netting and set-off\n\n## Collateral\n\nCredit risk exposures can be reduced by applying netting and set-off. For derivative transactions, the Group's normal practice is, on a legal entity basis, to enter into standard master agreements with counterparties (e.g. ISDAs). These master agreements typically allow for netting of credit risk exposure to a counterparty resulting from derivative transactions against the obligations to the counterparty in the event of default, and so produce a lower net credit exposure. These agreements may also reduce settlement exposure (e.g. for foreign exchange transactions) by allowing payments on the same day in the same currency to be set-off against one another.\n\nThe Group has the ability to call on collateral in the event of default of the counterparty, comprising:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 wholesale lending: a fixed charge over commercial property and other physical assets, in various forms\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 home loans: a fixed charge over residential property in the form of houses, flats and other dwellings\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 other retail lending: includes charges over motor vehicles and other physical assets; second lien charges over residential property; and finance lease receivables\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 reverse repurchase agreements: collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which have been legally transferred to the Group subject to an agreement to return them for a fixed price and\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 derivatives: the Group also often seeks to enter into a margin agreement (e.g. Credit Support Annex) with counterparties with which the Group has master netting agreements in place. These annexes to master agreements provide a mechanism for further reducing credit risk, whereby collateral (margin) is posted on a regular basis (typically daily) to collateralise the mark to market exposure of a derivative portfolio measured on a net basis\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 financial guarantees and similar offbalance sheet commitments: cash collateral may be held against these arrangements.",

These mitigate credit risk in two main ways:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 where recourse to the first counterparty remains, both counterparties must default before a loss materialises. This is less likely than the default of either counterparty individually so credit risk is reduced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetailed policies are in place to appropriately recognise and record credit risk mitigation. For more information, refer to pages 177 to 179 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).\n\n## Governance and oversight of ECLs under IFRS 9\n\ni) Impairment policy requirements are set and reviewed regularly, at a minimum annually, to maintain adherence to accounting standards. Key judgements inherent in policy, including the estimated life of revolving credit facilities and the quantitative criteria for assessing the significant increase in credit risk (SICR), are separately supported by analytical study. In particular, the quantitative thresholds used for assessing SICR are subject to a number of internal validation criteria, particularly in retail portfolios where thresholds decrease as the origination PD of each facility increases. Key policy requirements are also typically aligned to the Group's credit risk management strategy and practices, for example, wholesale customers that are risk managed on an individual basis are assessed for ECL on an individual basis upon entering Stage 3; furthermore, key internal risk management indicators of high risk are used to set SICR policy, for example, retail customers identified as High Risk Management Accounts are automatically deemed to have met the SICR criteria.\n\nThe Group's organisational structure and internal governance processes oversee the estimation of ECL across several areas, including: i) setting requirements in policy, including key assumptions and the application of key judgements; ii) the design and execution of models; and iii) review of ECL results.\n\nii) ECL is estimated in line with internal policy requirements using models which are validated by a qualified independent party to the model development area, the Independent Validation Unit (IVU), before first use and at a minimum annually thereafter. Each model is designated an owner who is responsible for:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 proposing post-model adjustments (PMA) to address model weaknesses or to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information have not been considered in the modelling process. Each PMA above an absolute and relative threshold is approved by the IVU for a set time period (usually a maximum of six months) together with a plan for remediation where related to a model deficiency. The most material PMAs are also approved by the CRO.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 model maintenance: monitoring of model performance including backtesting by comparing predicted ECL versus flow into stage 3 and coverage ratios; proposing material changes for independent IVU approval; and recalibrating model parameters on more timely data and\n\nModels must also assess ECL across a range of future economic conditions. These economic scenarios are generated via an independent model and ultimately set by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. Economic scenarios are regenerated at a minimum annually, to align with the Group's medium-term planning exercise, but also if the external consensus of the UK or US economy materially worsen. Each model used in the estimation of ECL, including key inputs, are governed by a series of internal controls, which include the validation of completeness and accuracy of data in golden source systems, documented data transformations and documented lineage of data transfers between systems.\n\niii) The Group Impairment Committee, formed of members from both Finance and Risk and attended by both the Group Finance Director and the Group CRO, is responsible for overseeing impairment policy and practice across the Group and will approve impairment results. Reported results and key messages are communicated to the BAC, which has an oversight role and provides challenge of key assumptions, including the basis of the scenarios adopted. Impairment results are then factored into management decision making, including but not limited to, business planning, risk appetite setting and portfolio management.\n\n## Market risk management (audited)\n\nThe risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Group's assets and liabilities from fluctuation in market variables including, but not limited to, interest rates, foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities and asset correlations.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nMarket risk arises primarily as a result of client facilitation in wholesale markets, involving market making activities, risk management solutions and execution of syndications. Upon execution of a trade with a client, the Group will look to hedge against the risk of the trade moving in an adverse direction. Mismatches between client transactions and hedges result in market risk due to changes in asset prices, volatility or correlations.\n\nMarket risk in the businesses resides primarily in Barclays International and Treasury. These businesses have the mandate to assume market risk. The front office and Treasury trading desks are responsible for managing market risk on a day-to-day basis, where they are required to understand and adhere to all limits applicable to their businesses. The Market Risk team supports the trading desks with the day-to-day limit management of market risk exposures through governance processes which are outlined in supporting market risk policies and standards.\n\nThe objectives of market risk management are to:\n\nMarket risk oversight and challenge is provided by business committees and Group committees, including the Market Risk Committee (MRC).\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 identify, understand and control market risk by robust measurement, limit setting, reporting and oversight\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 control market risk in the businesses according to the allocated appetite.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 facilitate business growth within a controlled and transparent risk management framework\n\nTo meet the above objectives, a governance structure is in place to manage these risks consistent with the ERMF.",

The Market Risk Principal Risk Lead (PR Lead) is responsible for the Market Risk Control Framework and, under delegated authority from the Group CRO, agrees with the business CROs a limit framework within the context of the approved market risk appetite.\n\nIn addition to MRC, the Corporate and Investment Bank Risk Committee ('CIBRC') is the main forum in which market risk exposures are discussed and reviewed with senior business heads. The Committee is chaired by the CRO of Barclays International and meets weekly, covering current market events, notable market risk exposures, and key risk topics. New business initiatives are generally socialised at CIBRC before any changes to risk appetite or associated limits are considered in other governance committees.\n\nThe MRC reviews and makes recommendations concerning the Group-wide market risk profile. This includes overseeing the operation of the Market Risk Framework and associated standards and policies; reviewing market or regulatory issues and limits and utilisation. The committee is chaired by the PR Lead and attendees include the business heads of market risk and business aligned market risk managers.\n\nThe head of each business is accountable for all market risks associated with its activities, while the head of the market risk team covering each business is responsible for implementing the risk control framework for market risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on market risk management, refer to the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).\n\n## Management value at risk (VaR)\n\nLimits are applied at the total level as well as by risk factor type, which are then cascaded down to particular trading desks and businesses by the market risk management function.\n\nVaR is an estimate of the potential loss arising from unfavourable market movements if the current positions were to be held unchanged for one business day. For internal market risk management purposes, a historical simulation methodology with a two-year equally weighted historical period, at the 95% confidence level is used for all trading books and some banking books.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the market risk performance section for a review of management VaR in 2020.\n\n## Treasury and capital risk management\n\nThis comprises:\n\nLiquidity risk: the risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets.\n\nCapital risk: the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments or stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group's pension plans.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book: the risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Treasury function manages treasury and capital risk exposure on a day-to-day basis with the Group Treasury Committee acting as the principal management body. The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for oversight and provide insight into key capital, liquidity, interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and pension risk management activities.\n\nThe efficient management of liquidity is essential to the Group in order to retain the confidence of the financial markets and maintain the sustainability of the business. The liquidity risk control framework is used to manage all liquidity risk exposures under both typical and stressed conditions. The framework is designed to maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount, quality and funding tenor profile to support the liquidity risk appetite as expressed by the Barclays PLC Board. The liquidity risk appetite is monitored against both internal and regulatory liquidity metrics.\n\n## Liquidity risk management (audited) Overview\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe liquidity risk control framework is designed to deliver the appropriate term and structure of funding, consistent with the liquidity risk appetite set by the Board. The control framework incorporates a range of ongoing business management tools to monitor, limit and stress test the Group's balance sheet, contingent liabilities and the recovery plan. Limit setting and transfer pricing are tools that are designed to control the level of liquidity risk taken and drive the appropriate mix of funds. Together, these tools reduce the likelihood that a liquidity stress event could lead to an inability to meet Group's obligations as they fall due.\n\nTreasury has the primary responsibility for managing liquidity risk within the set risk appetite. Both Risk and Treasury contribute to the production of the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for the management and governance of the liquidity risk mandate, as defined by the Board.\n\nThe Board approves the Group funding plan, internal stress tests, regulatory stress test results, recovery plan and Liquidity Risk Appetite. The Group Treasury Committee is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity risk in line with the Group's funding management objectives, funding plan and risk appetite. The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the liquidity risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of liquidity risk. The Board Risk Committee reviews the risk profile, and annually reviews risk appetite and the impact of stress scenarios on the Group funding plan/forecast in order to agree the Group's projected funding abilities.\n\nCapital risk is managed through ongoing monitoring and management of the capital position, regular stress testing and a robust capital governance framework. The objectives of the framework are to maintain adequate capital for the Group and legal entities to withstand the impact of the risks that may arise under normal and stressed conditions, and maintain adequate capital to cover current and forecast business needs and associated risks to provide a viable and sustainable business offering.\n\n## Capital risk management (audited) Overview",

The capital management strategy, outlined in the Group and legal entity capital plans, is developed in alignment with the control framework and policy for capital risk, and is implemented consistently in order to deliver on the Group's objectives.\n\nTreasury has the primary responsibility for managing and monitoring capital. The Treasury and Capital Risk function provides oversight of capital risk and is an independent risk function that reports to the Group CRO. Production of the Barclays PLC Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is the responsibility of Treasury.\n\nThe Board approves the Group capital plan, internal stress tests and results of regulatory stress tests, and the Group recovery plan. The Group Treasury Committee is responsible for monitoring and managing capital risk in line with the Group's capital management objectives, capital plan and risk frameworks. The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the capital risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of capital risk. The BRC reviews the risk profile, and annually reviews risk appetite and the impact of stress scenarios on the Group capital plan/forecast in order to agree the Group's projected capital adequacy.\n\n## Pension risk\n\nLocal management assures compliance with an entity's minimum regulatory capital requirements by reporting to local Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs) with oversight by the Group Treasury Committee, as required. In 2020, Barclays complied with all regulatory minimum capital requirements.\n\nThe Group maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. The ability of schemes to meet pension payments is achieved with investments and contributions.\n\nPension risk arises because the market value of pension fund assets might decline; investment returns might reduce; or the estimated value of pension liabilities might increase. The Group monitors the pension risks arising from its defined benefit pension schemes and works with Trustees to address shortfalls. In these circumstances, the Group could be required or might choose to make extra contributions to the pension fund. The Group's main defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants in 2012.\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book management (IRRBB)\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is driven by customer deposit taking and lending activities, investments in the liquid asset portfolio and funding activities. As per the Group's policy to remain within the defined risk appetite, hedging strategies are executed to mitigate the risks. However, the Group remains susceptible to interest rate risk and other non-traded market risks from key sources:\n\n## Overview\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 interest rate and repricing risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by a change in interest rates, differences in the timing of interest rate changes between assets and liabilities, and other constraints on interest rate changes as per product terms and conditions\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 investment risks in the liquid asset portfolio: the risk that the fair value of assets held in the liquid asset portfolio and associated risk management portfolios could be adversely impacted by market volatility, creating volatility in capital directly.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 customer behavioural risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by the discretion that customers and counterparties may have in respect of being able to vary their contractual obligations with Barclays. This risk is often referred to by industry regulators as 'embedded option risk'\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nIn addition, the Group's IRRBB policy sets out the processes and key controls required to identify all IRRBB risks arising from banking book operations, to monitor the risk exposures via a set of metrics with a frequency in line with the risk management horizon, and to manage these risks within agreed risk appetite and limits.\n\nThe entity ALCOs, together with the Group Treasury Committee, are responsible for monitoring and managing IRRBB risk in line with the Group's management objectives and risk frameworks. The GRC and Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the IRRBB risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of IRRBB. The BRC reviews the interest rate risk profile, including annual review of the risk appetite and the impact of stress scenarios on the interest rate risk of the Group's banking books.\n\n## Operational risk management\n\nThe risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events (for example fraud) where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks.\n\n## Overview\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 deliver an operational risk capability owned and used by business leaders to enable sound risk decisions over the long term\n\nThe management of operational risk has three key objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 provide the frameworks, policies and standards to enable management to meet their risk management responsibilities while the second line of defence provides robust, independent, and effective oversight and challenge and\n\nThe Group operates within a system of internal controls that enables business to be transacted and risk taken without exposing it to unacceptable potential losses or reputational damages.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 deliver a consistent and aggregated measurement of operational risk that will provide clear and relevant insights, so that the right management actions can be taken to keep the operational risk profile consistent with the Group's strategy, the stated risk appetite and stakeholder needs.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe prime responsibility for the management of operational risk and the compliance with control requirements rests within the business and functional units where the risk arises. The operational risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk committees and control committees. Operational risk issues escalated from these meetings are considered through the second line of defence review meetings. Depending on their nature, the outputs of these meetings are presented to the Operational Risk Profile Forum, the Operational Risk Committee, the BRC or the BAC. In addition, specific reports are prepared by Operational Risk on a regular basis for the GRC and the BRC.",

This includes the risk of failing to: adhere to prudential regulatory requirements, provide regulatory submissions; or monitor and manage adherence to new prudential regulatory requirements.\n\nOperational risks are grouped into risk categories to support effective risk management, measurement and reporting. These comprise: Data Management Risk; Financial Reporting Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk; Operational Resilience Planning Risk; Payments Process Risk; People Risk; Premises Risk; Physical Security Risk; Strategic Investment Change Management Risk; Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk; and Transaction Operations Risk.\n\n## Risk themes\n\nBarclays also recognises that there are certain threats/risk drivers that are more thematic and have the potential to impact the Group's strategic objectives. These are risk themes which require an overarching and integrated risk management approach. The Group's risk themes include Cyber, Data, and Resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor definitions of the Group's operational risk categories and risk themes, refer to the management of operational risk section in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020.\n\n## Model risk management\n\nThe risk of the potential adverse consequences from financial assessments or decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.\n\n## Overview\n\nSince models are imperfect and incomplete representations of reality, they may be subject to errors affecting the accuracy of their output. Model errors and misuse are the primary sources of model risk.\n\nThe Group uses models to support a broad range of activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures, conducting stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, managing client assets, and meeting reporting requirements.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe model risk management framework consists of the model risk policy and standards.\n\nThe Group has a dedicated Model Risk Management (MRM) function that consists of four teams: (i) Independent Validation Unit (IVU), responsible for model validation and approval; (ii) Model Governance and Controls (MGC), responsible for regulatory, audit, policy, standards, conformance and controls; (iii) Strategy and Transformation responsible for inventory, strategy, communications and business management and (iv) Model Risk Measurement and Quantification (MRMQ), responsible for the design of the framework and methodology to accurately measure and quantify model risk.\n\nThe policy prescribes Group-wide, end-to-end requirements for the identification, measurement and management of model risk, covering model documentation, development, implementation, monitoring, annual review, independent validation and approval, change and reporting processes. The policy is supported by global standards covering model inventory, documentation, validation, complexity and materiality, testing and monitoring, overlays, risk appetite, as well as vendor models and stress testing challenger models.\n\nThe function reports to the Group CRO and operates a global framework.

The RRMF sets out what is required to manage reputation risk across the Group.\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group are required to operate within established reputation risk appetite, and their component businesses prepare reports for their respective Risk and Board Risk Committees highlighting their most significant current and potential reputation risks and issues and how they are being managed. These reports are a key internal source of information for the quarterly reputation risk reports which are prepared for Barclays Group ExCo and the Board.\n\n## Legal risk management\n\nThe risk of loss or imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of the Group to meet its legal obligations including regulatory or contractual requirements.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Group has no tolerance for wilful breaches of laws, regulations or other legal obligations. However, the multitude of laws and regulations across the globe are highly dynamic and their application to particular circumstances is often unclear. This results in a high level of inherent legal risk which the Group seeks to mitigate through the operation of a Group-wide legal risk management framework, including the implementation of Group-wide legal risk policies requiring the engagement of legal professionals in situations that have the potential for legal risk. Notwithstanding these mitigating actions, the Group operates with a level of residual legal risk, for which the Group has limited tolerance.\n\nThe Group's businesses and functions have primary responsibility for identifying and escalating legal risk in their area as well as responsibility for adherence to minimum control requirements.\n\nThe Group General Counsel is responsible for maintaining a Group-wide legal risk management framework. This includes defining the relevant legal risk policies and oversight of the implementation of controls to manage and escalate legal risk.\n\nThe Legal Function organisation and coverage model aligns legal expertise to businesses, functions, products, activities and geographic locations so that the Group receives support from appropriate legal professionals, working in partnership to manage legal risk. The senior management of the Legal Function oversees, challenges and monitors the legal risk profile and effectiveness of the legal risk control environment across the Group. The Legal Function does not sit in any of the Three Lines of Defence but supports them all.\n\nThe legal risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk committees and control committees. The Group Risk Committee is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of risk management across the Group.

Customer and client default rates have remained relatively stable despite the impact of the pandemic and volatile macroeconomic environment.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nRefer to the credit risk management section for details of governance, policies and procedures.\n\nCredit impairment charges increased to \u00a34,838m (2019: \u00a31,912m) due to the deterioration in economic outlook driven by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The current year charge is broadly driven by \u00a32,323m of non-default provision for potential future customer and client stress and \u00a3800m of single name deterioration. The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) provision remains highly uncertain as the economic impact of the global pandemic continues to evolve. The Group loan loss rate was 138bps (2019: 55bps).\n\n## Maximum exposure and effects of netting, collateral and risk transfer\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation between the maximum exposure and its net exposure to credit risk, reflecting the financial effects of risk mitigation reducing the exposure.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nFor financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, maximum exposure to credit risk represents the balance sheet carrying value after allowance for impairment. For off-balance sheet guarantees, the maximum exposure is the\n\nIn retail cards, credit profiles improved or were stable versus pre-pandemic levels as a result of government support measures and customer deleveraging. In wholesale, furlough and liquidity funding schemes are supporting businesses through the pandemic, with limited credit deterioration. This lack of deterioration, combined in some cases with improving economics, is leading to large scale credit loss stock releases on a modelled basis in pockets of the portfolio. Given this backdrop, management has applied COVID-19 specific adjustments to modelled outputs to ensure the full potential impacts of stress are provided for. These adjustments address the temporary nature of ongoing government support, the uncertainty in relation to the timing of stress and the degree to which economic consensus has yet captured the range of economic uncertainty, particularly in the UK. Refer to the Management adjustment to models for impairment section on page 180 for further details.\n\nmaximum amount that the Group would have to pay if the guarantees were to be called upon. For loan commitments and other credit related commitments that are irrevocable over the life of the respective facilities, the maximum exposure is the full amount of the committed facilities.\n\nThe Group mitigates the credit risk to which it is exposed through netting and set-off, collateral and risk transfer. Further detail on the Group's policies to each of these forms of credit enhancement is presented on pages 177 to 179 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).\n\nThis and subsequent analyses of credit risk exclude other financial assets not subject to credit risk, mainly equity securities.\n\n## Overview\n\nOf the unmitigated on-balance sheet exposure, a significant portion relates to cash held at central banks, cash collateral and settlement balances, and debt securities issued by governments all of which are considered to be lower risk. The increase in the Group's net exposure to credit risk is driven by increases in cash held at central banks, cash collateral and settlement balances, trading portfolio assets,\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group's net exposure to credit risk, after taking into account credit risk mitigation, increased by 10% to \u00a3876.8bn. Overall, the extent to which the Group holds mitigation against its total exposure increased to 46% (2019: 43%).\n\nFurther detail can be found in the Financial statements section in Note 7 Credit impairment charges. Descriptions of terminology can be found in the glossary, available at home.barclays/annualreport\n\n## Key metrics\n\nIncrease in impairment allowances of\n\nImpairment allowances on loans and advances at amortised cost, including off-balance sheet elements of the allowance, increased by \u00a32,769m to \u00a39,399m (2019: \u00a36,630m). The increase is driven by Barclays International \u00a31,828m, Barclays UK \u00a3855m, and Head Office \u00a386m. Refer to the Expected Credit Losses section for further details.\n\n## \u00a32,769 m\n\nderivative financial instruments, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and off-balance sheet loan commitments. Trading portfolio liability positions, which to a significant extent economically hedge trading portfolio assets but which are not held specifically for risk management purposes, are excluded from the analysis. The credit quality of counterparties to derivatives, financial investments and wholesale loan assets are predominantly investment grade. Further analysis on the credit quality of assets is presented in the approach to management and representation of credit quality section.\n\nWhere collateral has been obtained in the event of default, the Group does not, ordinarily, use such assets for its own operations and they are usually sold on a timely basis. The carrying value of assets held by the Group as at 31 December 2020, as a result of the enforcement of collateral, was \u00a36m (2019: \u00a36m).\n\n## Collateral obtained",

Also included are off-balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts by gross exposure and impairment allowance and coverage ratio by stage allocation as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Loans and advances at amortised cost by stage\n\nImpairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately.

Overall limits and exposures have remained broadly stable over the year whilst provisions have increased in light of the heightened stress. The wholesale portfolio also benefits from a hedge protection programme that enables effective risk management against systemic losses.\n\nThe table below presents a breakdown of loans and advances at amortised cost and the impairment allowance, with gross exposure and stage allocation for selected industry sectors within the wholesale loans portfolio. The industry sectors have been selected based upon the level of management focus they have received following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The credit risk industry concentration disclosure in the Analysis of the concentration of credit risk section represents all the industry categories and the below only covers a subset of that table.\n\n## Loans and advances at amortised cost by selected sectors\n\n|                              | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance   |\n|------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2020       | Stage 1 \u00a3m       | Stage 2  \u00a3m      | Stage 3 \u00a3m       | Total \u00a3m         | Stage 1 \u00a3m             | Stage 2  \u00a3m            | Stage 3 \u00a3m             | Total \u00a3m               |\n| Air travel                   | 367              | 525              | 56               | 948              | 9                      | 27                     | 23                     | 59                     |\n| Hospitality and leisure      | 4,440            | 2,387            | 313              | 7,140            | 53                     | 115                    | 61                     | 229                    |\n| Oil and gas                  | 1,754            | 854              | 465              | 3,073            | 31                     | 27                     | 140                    | 198                    |\n| Retail                       | 3,907            | 1,153            | 283              | 5,343            | 78                     | 51                     | 108                    | 237                    |\n| Shipping                     | 308              | 389              | 12               | 709              | 2                      | 30                     | 1                      | 33                     |\n| Transportation               | 1,148            | 253              | 125              | 1,526            | 19                     | 10                     | 57                     | 86                     |\n| Total                        | 11,924           | 5,561            | 1,254            | 18,739           | 192                    | 260                    | 390                    | 842                    |\n| Total of Wholesale exposures | 10%              | 26%              | 35%              | 13%              | 60%                    | 37%                    | 37%                    | 40%                    |\n\n|                              | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance   |\n|------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2019       | Stage 1 \u00a3m       | Stage 2  \u00a3m      | Stage 3 \u00a3m       | Total \u00a3m         | Stage 1 \u00a3m             | Stage 2  \u00a3m            | Stage 3 \u00a3m             | Total \u00a3m               |\n| Air travel                   | 194              | 31               | 26               | 251              | -

The reclassification followed a review of back-testing of results which indicated that origination probability of default characteristics were unnecessarily moving Stage 1 accounts into Stage 2.\n- a Changes to models used for calculation include a \u00a3309m adjustment which largely represents model remediation to correct for over recovery of debt in UK unsecured lending. Barclays continually review the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This ensures that the models used continue to reflect the risks inherent across the businesses.\n- c The \u00a31.9bn disposals reported within Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending portfolio include \u00a31.7bn sale of motor financing business within the Barclays Partner Finance business and \u00a30.2bn relate to debt sales undertaken during the year. The \u00a32.4bn disposal reported within Wholesale loans include sale of debt securities as part of Group Treasury Operations.\n- e  Other financial assets subject to impairment not included in the table above include cash collateral and settlement balances, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and other assets. These have a total gross exposure of \u00a3180.3bn (December 2019: \u00a3149.3bn) and impairment allowance of \u00a3165m (December 2019: \u00a324m). This comprises \u00a311m ECL (December 2019: \u00a312m) on \u00a3175.7bn Stage 1 assets (December 2019: \u00a3148.5bn), \u00a39m (December 2019: \u00a32m) on \u00a34.4bn Stage 2 fair value through other comprehensive income assets, cash collateral and settlement assets (December 2019: \u00a30.8bn) and \u00a3145m (December 2019: \u00a310m) on \u00a3154m Stage 3 other assets (December 2019: \u00a310m).\n- d  In 2020, gross write-offs amounted to \u00a31,964m (2019: \u00a31,883m) and post write-off recoveries amounted to \u00a335m (2019: \u00a3124m). Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post write-off recoveries and amounted to \u00a31,929m (2019: \u00a31,759m).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The \u00a3777m disposal reported within Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending portfolio relates to debt sales undertaken during the year. Finally, disposals of \u00a32,285m within Wholesale loans relate to the sale of debt securities as part of the Group's Treasury operations.\n- a Changes to models used for calculation include a \u00a3101m movement in Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending and a \u00a328m movement in Wholesale loans. These reflect methodology changes made during the year. Barclays continually review the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This ensures that the models used continue to reflect the risks inherent across the businesses.\n- c In 2019, gross write-offs amounted to \u00a31,883m (2018: \u00a31,891m) and post write-off recoveries amounted to \u00a3124m (2018: \u00a3195m). Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post write-off recoveries and amounted to \u00a31,759m (2018: \u00a31,696m).\n- d  Other financial assets subject to impairment not included in the table above include cash collateral and settlement balances, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and other assets.

This is augmented by inclusion of accounts meeting the designated high risk criteria (including watchlist) for the portfolio under the qualitative test. Qualitative tests predominantly include \u00a38.5bn (2019: \u00a39.3bn) in Barclays UK of which \u00a37.1bn (2019: \u00a37.4bn) relates to UK Home Finance, \u00a31.0bn (2019: \u00a31.1bn) relates to Business Banking and \u00a30.1bn (2019: \u00a30.4bn) relates to Barclaycard UK. A further \u00a33.3bn (2019: \u00a33.4bn) relates to Barclays International of which \u00a32bn (2019: \u00a31.7bn) relates to Corporate and Investment Bank, \u00a30.3bn (2019: \u00a30.9bn) relates to Barclaycard International and \u00a30.7bn (2019: \u00a30.7bn) relates to Private Bank.\n\nFor further detail on the three criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk required for Stage 2 classification, refer to Note 7.\n\nA small number of other accounts (1% of impairment allowances and 5% of gross exposure) are included in Stage 2. These accounts are not otherwise identified by the quantitative or qualitative tests but are more than 30 days past due. The percentage triggered by these backstop criteria is a measure of the effectiveness of the Stage 2 criteria in identifying deterioration prior to delinquency. These balances include items in the Corporate and Investment Bank for reasons such as outstanding interest and fees rather than principal balances.\n\n## Stage 3 decomposition\n\n## Loans and advances at amortised cost\n\n|                                                          | 2020               | 2020                      | 2019               | 2019                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| As at 31 December                                        | Gross  exposure \u00a3m | Impairment  allowance  \u00a3m | Gross  exposure \u00a3m | Impairment  allowance  \u00a3m |\n| Exposures not charged-off including within cure period a | 3,773              | 831                       | 3,540              | 857                       |\n| Exposures individually assessed or in recovery book b    | 5,224              | 2,907                     | 4,383              | 2,371                     |\n| Total Stage 3                                            | 8,997              | 3,738                     | 7,923              | 3,228                     |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Exposures individually assessed or in recovery book cannot cure out of Stage 3.\n- a Includes \u00a32.6bn (2019: \u00a32.5bn) of gross exposure in a cure period that must remain in Stage 3 for a minimum of 12 months before moving to Stage 2.",

These adjustments address the temporary nature of ongoing government support, the uncertainty in relation to the timing of stress and the degree to which economic consensus has not yet captured the range of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe pandemic impacted the global economy throughout 2020 and macroeconomic forecasts indicate longer-term impacts will result in higher unemployment levels and customer and client stress. However, to date, little real credit deterioration has occurred, largely as a result of government and bank support. Observed 30-day arrears rates in consumer loans in particular have remained stable in both US cards (2020: 2.5%; 2019: 2.7%) and UK cards (2020: 1.7%; 2019: 1.7%). A similar phenomenon is observed in wholesale, where the average risk profile of the portfolio has broadly remained stable during the year and has not deteriorated in line with the macroeconomic crisis.\n\nThe COVID-19 adjustments of \u00a32.1bn broadly comprised the following:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Adjusting macroeconomic variables deemed temporarily influenced by support measures, enabling models to consume the expected stress \u00a31.2bn;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Use of expert judgement to adjust the probability of default \u00a30.7bn to pre-COVID levels to reflect the impact of temporary support measures on underlying customer behaviour, partially offset by government guarantees \u00a3(0.1)bn which are materially against BBLs;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 A \u00a30.3bn adjustment has been applied to selected sectors in Stage 1 to increase the ECL coverage on these names in line with the average Stage 2 coverage. This adjustment is materially in response to the increased stress in these sectors not captured through the ECL models.\n\n## Other adjustments\n\nCredit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending: Includes a net release in ECL of \u00a30.6bn due to a reclassification of \u00a32bn gross loans and advances from Stage 2 to Stage 1 in credit cards and unsecured loans. The reclassification followed a review of back-testing of results which indicated that origination probability of default characteristics were unnecessarily moving Stage 1 accounts into Stage 2.\n\nHome loans: The low average LTV nature of the UK Home Loans portfolio means that modelled ECL estimates are low in all but the most severe economic scenarios. An adjustment is held to maintain an appropriate level of ECL.\n\nWholesale loans: Adjustments include a release in the Investment Bank to limit excessive ECL sensitivity to the macroeconomic variable for Federal Tax Receipts and a correction to Corporate and Investment Bank ECL to adjust for model inaccuracies informed by back-testing.\n\nManagement adjustments of \u00a3340m in 2019 largely comprises a \u00a3210m PMA to compensate for over-recovery of debt in UK unsecured lending, and subsequently fixed within the underlying model; and \u00a3150m for UK economic uncertainty, now subsumed within managements broader approach to economic uncertainty.",

        "page_content": "Risk review\n\n## Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury (short and medium-term forecasts), Bloomberg (based on median of economic forecasts) and the Urban Land Institute (for US House Prices), which forms the Baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two favourable scenarios (Upside 1 and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a broadly similar severity to Barclays' internal stress tests and stress scenarios provided by regulators whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. Downside 2 is benchmarked to the Bank of England's stress scenarios and to the most severe scenario from Moody's inventory, but is not designed to be the same. The favourable scenarios are calibrated to reflect upside risks to the Baseline scenario to the extent that is broadly consistent with recent favourable benchmark scenarios. All scenarios are regenerated at a minimum semi-annually. The scenarios include eight economic variables, (GDP, unemployment, House Price Index (HPI) and base rates in both the UK and US markets), and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to evolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately eight years.\n\nThe measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of probabilities of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation of exposures at default (EAD) and assessing significant increases in credit risk.\n\nScenarios used to calculate the Group's ECL charge were reviewed and updated regularly throughout 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter. The current Baseline scenario reflects the latest consensus economic forecasts with a steady recovery in GDP in the UK and the US, and unemployment continuing to decrease in the US and peaking at Q221 in the UK followed by a steady decline. In the downside scenarios, an economic downturn in early 2021 in the UK and the US begins to recover later in the year, with unemployment increasing to the end of 2021. In the upside scenarios, the strong rebound in UK and US GDP continues into 2021, following the bounce-back in growth in Q320 and, subsequently, the projections stay above the year on year growth rates seen in the Baseline for a prolonged period of time before finally reverting to the long-term run rate. This reflects the assumption of approved vaccines being successfully rolled out throughout 2021 and pent up savings being deployed into a more certain consumer environment to drive significant growth. Scenario weights have been updated to reflect the latest economics.\n\nAs a result of government and bank support measures, significant credit deterioration has not yet occurred. This delay increases uncertainty on the timing of the stress and the realisation of defaults. Management has applied COVID-19 specific adjustments to modelled outputs to reflect the temporary nature of ongoing government support, the uncertainty in relation to the timing of stress and the degree to which economic consensus has yet captured the range of economic uncertainty, particularly in the UK. As a result, ECL is higher than would be the case if it were based on the forecast economic scenarios alone.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review: Credit risk\n\n## Risk performance continued\n\n## Scenario weights (audited)\n\nThe range of forecast paths generated in the calculation of the weights at 31 December 2020 is much wider than in previous periods due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, thus the Upside and Downside scenarios are further away from the tails of the distribution than previously, resulting in a more even spread of weights than at 31 December 2019.\n\nThe methodology for estimating probability weights for each of the scenarios involves a comparison of the distribution of key historical UK and US macroeconomic variables against the forecast paths of the five scenarios. The methodology works such that the Baseline (reflecting current consensus outlook) has the highest weight and the weights of adverse and favourable scenarios depend on the deviation from the Baseline; the further from the Baseline, the smaller the weight. This is reflected in the table below where the probability weights of the scenarios are shown. A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are normalised to equate to 100%. The same scenarios and weights that are used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used for Barclays internal planning purposes. The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices, and credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment.\n\nThe economic environment remains uncertain and future impairment charges may be subject to further volatility (including from changes to macroeconomic variable forecasts) depending on the longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, as well as the longer term effectiveness of central bank, government and other support measures.\n\nAnnual paths show quarterly averages for the year (unemployment and base rate) or change in the year (GDP and HPI). Expected worst point is the most negative quarter in the relevant 3 year period, which is calculated relative to the start point for GDP and HPI.\n\nThe tables below show the key consensus macroeconomic variables used in the baseline scenario (3-year annual paths), the probability weights applied to each scenario and the macroeconomic variables by scenario using 'specific bases' i.e. the most extreme position of each variable in the context of the scenario, for example, the highest unemployment for downside scenarios and the lowest unemployment for upside scenarios. 5-year average tables and movement over time graphs provide additional transparency.\n\n| Baseline average macroeconomic variables used in the calculation of ECL   |         |         |        |                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2020                                                    | 2021  % | 2022  % | 2023 % | Expected  Worst Point   % |\n| UK GDP a                                                                  | 6.3     | 3.3     | 2.6    | 1.2                       |\n| UK unemployment b                                                         | 6.7     | 6.4     | 5.8    | 7.4                       |\n| UK HPI c                                                                  | 2.4     | 2.3     | 5.0    | 0.6                       |\n| UK bank rate                                                              | -       | (0.1)   | -      | (0.1)                     |\n| US GDP a                                                                  | 3.9     | 3.1     | 2.9    | 1.0                       |\n| US unemployment d                                                         | 6.9     | 5.7     | 5.6    | 7.5                       |\n| US HPI e                                                                  | 2.8     | 4.7     | 4.7    | 0.7                       |\n| US federal funds rate                                                     | 0.3     | 0.3     | 0.3    | 0.3                       |\n\n| As at 31 December 2019   |   2020  % |   2021  % |   2022 % |   Expected  Worst Point   % |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| UK GDP a                 |       1.3 |       1.5 |      1.6 |                         0.3 |\n| UK unemployment b        |       4.1 |       4.2 |      4.2 |                         4.2 |\n| UK HPI c                 |       1.9 |       3.1 |      3.6 |                         0.3 |\n| UK bank rate             |       0.6 |       0.5 |      0.8 |                         0.5 |\n| US GDP a                 |       2.1 |       1.9 |      1.9 |                         0.5 |\n| US unemployment d        |       3.6 |       3.9 |      4   |                         4   |\n| US HPI e                 |       3.4 |       2.9 |      2.8 |                         1   |\n| US federal funds rate    |       1.7 |       1.5 |      1.7 |                         1.5 |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Average UK unemployment rate 16-year+; expected worst point is the highest rate in the 12-quarter period starting Q121 (2019: Q120).\n- a Average Real GDP seasonally adjusted change in year; expected worst point is the minimum growth relative to Q420 (2019: Q419) based on a 12-quarter period.\n- c Change in year end UK HPI = Halifax All Houses, All Buyers index, relative to prior year end; worst point is based on minimum growth relative to Q420 (2019: Q419) based on a 12-quarter period.\n- e  Change in year end US HPI = FHFA house price index, relative to prior year end; worst point is based on minimum growth relative to Q420 (2019: Q419) based on a 12-quarter period.\n- d  Average US civilian unemployment rate 16-year+; expected worst point is the highest rate in the 12-quarter period starting Q121 (2019: Q120).",

Model exposures are allocated to a stage based on the individual scenario rather than through a probability-weighted approach as required for Barclays reported impairment allowances. As a result, it is not possible to back solve to the final reported weighted ECL from the individual scenarios as a balance may be assigned to a different stage dependent on the scenario. Model exposure uses exposure at default (EAD) values and is not directly comparable to gross exposure used in prior disclosures. For Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending, an average EAD measure is used (12-month or lifetime, depending on stage allocation in each scenario). Therefore, the model exposure movement into Stage 2 is higher than the corresponding Stage 1 reduction.\n\n## ECL under 100% weighted scenarios for modelled portfolios (audited)\n\nAll ECL using a model is included, with the exception of Treasury assets (\u00a313m of ECL), providing additional coverage as compared to the 2019 year-end disclosure. Non-modelled exposures and management adjustments are excluded. Management adjustments can be found in the Management adjustments to models for impairment section.\n\nThe Downside 2 scenario represents a severe global recession with substantial falls in both UK and US GDP. Unemployment in UK markets rises towards 10% and US markets rises towards 14% and there are substantial falls in asset prices including housing. Under the Downside 2 scenario, model exposure moves between stages as the economic environment weakens. This can be seen in the movement of \u00a327bn of model exposure into Stage 2 between the Weighted and Downside 2 scenario. ECL increases in Stage 2 predominantly due to unsecured portfolios as economic conditions deteriorate.\n\nModel exposures allocated to Stage 3 do not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on observable evidence of default as at 31 December 2020 and not on macroeconomic scenarios.",

The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk. The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged. Further detail on the Group policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the geographic concentration of the Group's assets remained broadly consistent with 2019.

At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, mortgages with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.\n\nLoans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Group's impairment policies.\n\nHigher risk: there is concern over the obligor's ability to make payments when due. However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency. There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided. However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.\n\n## Debt securities\n\n## Balance sheet credit quality\n\nFor assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer. Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies. The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Fitch or Moody's. Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.\n\nThe following tables present the credit quality of the Group's assets exposed to credit risk.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the ratio of the Group's on-balance sheet assets classified as strong (0.0 to <0.60%) remained stable at 87% (2019: 86%) of total assets exposed to credit risk. Further analysis of debt securities by issuer and issuer type and netting and collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments is presented in the Analysis of debt securities section and Analysis of derivatives section.\n\n## Overview",

Examples would include leveraged corporate loans or non-prime credit cards.\n\nThe below tables represents credit risk profile by PD grade for loans and advances at amortised cost, contingent liabilities and loan commitments.\n\nIFRS 9 Stage 1 and Stage 2 classification is not dependent solely on the absolute probability of default but on elements that determine a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (see Note 7), including relative movement in probability of default since initial recognition. There is therefore no direct relationship between credit quality and IFRS 9 stage classification.\n\n| Credit risk profile by internal PD grade for loans and advances at amortised cost (audited) Gross

This decrease was driven by supply and demand effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand was impacted by a significant shrinking of the market in Q2 although this was partially offset by a resurgent Q3 and Q4. High LTV supply was reduced by credit management actions.\n\nHead Office: Italian home loans and advances at amortised cost reduced to \u00a35.7bn (2019: \u00a36.0bn) and continue to run-off since new bookings ceased in 2016. The portfolio is secured on residential property with an average balance weighted mark to market LTV of 62.1% (2019: 64.4%). 90-day arrears remained broadly stable at 1.7% (2019: 1.8%) and gross charge-off rate increased to 1.0% (2019: 0.8%). At 31 December 2020, the book value of the portfolio where payment holidays remain in place was \u00a3181.7m, representing 3.2% of the portfolio.\n\nDuring 2020, a total of 128,000 payment holidays were provided to customers. At 31 December 2020, the book value of the portfolio where payment holidays remain in place was \u00a32.2bn, representing 1.5% of the portfolio.\n\n## Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail

        "page_content": "UK cards: 30 and 90-day arrears rates remained stable at 1.7% and 0.8% respectively, despite balances reducing by c.\u00a34.5bn. Delinquency rates initially increased as some customers missed payments prior to payment holidays being initiated. Subsequently payment holidays and government support schemes were introduced which, coupled with significantly lower spend and balance growth activities, resulted in suppressed flows into delinquency cycles. Upon exit from payment holidays the majority of customers were able to resume making payments. During 2020, a total of 178,000 payment holidays were provided to customers. At 31 December 2020, the book value of the portfolio where payment holidays remain in place was \u00a393m, representing 0.8% of the portfolio.\n\nBarclays Partner Finance: 30-day arrears rate reduced to 0.5% (2019: 0.9%) due to the sale of the motor financing business and the impact of payment holidays however the vast majority of these were exited and customers resumed making payments. A total of 17,000 payment holidays were provided to customers and 18,000 payment holidays were provided to motor financing business customers in the year. At 31 December 2020, the book value of the portfolio where payment holidays remain in place was \u00a36.6m, representing 0.3% of the portfolio.\n\nUK personal loans: 30 and 90-day arrears rates both increased by 0.2% to 2.3% and 1.2% respectively driven by a 25% reduction in overall balances, coupled with a higher flow in to delinquency of customers previously granted a payment holiday. During 2020, a total of 84,000 payment holidays were provided to customers. At 31 December 2020, the book value of the portfolio where payment holidays remain in place was \u00a385.4m, representing 1.9% of the portfolio.\n\nUS cards: 30-day arrears rate decreased to 2.5% (2019: 2.7%) due to government support schemes and payment holidays resulting in fewer accounts entering into delinquency. 90-day arrears rate remained stable at 1.4%. Write-off rates were in line with seasonal trends. A total of 251,000 payment holidays were provided to customers in the year. At 31 December 2020, the book value of the portfolio where payment holidays remain in place was \u00a354.7m, representing 0.3% of the portfolio.\n\n## Exposure to UK commercial real estate (CRE)\n\nGermany consumer lending: Increases in 30- and 90-days arrear rates were primarily driven by the drop in the overall balances. A total of 9,000 payment holidays were provided to customers in the year. At 31 December 2020, the book value of the portfolio where payment holidays remain in place was \u00a30.24m, representing 0.01% of the portfolio.\n\nThe UK CRE portfolio includes property investment, development, trading and house builders but excludes social housing and contractors.\n\nUK CRE summary\n\n|                                              | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| As at 31 December                            |        |        |\n| UK CRE loans and advances (\u00a3m)               | 9,969  | 9,051  |\n| Stage 3 balances (\u00a3m)                        | 384    | 254    |\n| Stage 3 balances as % of UK CRE balances (%) | 3.9    | 2.8    |\n| Impairment allowances (\u00a3m)                   | 99     | 52     |\n| Stage 3 coverage ratio (%)                   | 19.7   | 7.5    |\n| Total collateral (\u00a3m) a                      | 26,240 | 26,876 |\n| Year ended 31 December                       |        |        |\n| Impairment charge (\u00a3m)                       | 47     | 6      |\n\n## Note\n\n- a Based on the most recent valuation assessment.\n\n## Maturity analysis of exposure to UK CRE\n\n|                   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   | Contractual maturity of UK CRE loans and advances at amortised cost   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December | Stage 3  balances \u00a3m                                                  | Not  more than  six months \u00a3m                                         | Over  six months  but not  more than  one year \u00a3m                     | Over  one year  but not  more than  two years \u00a3m                      | Over  two years  but not  more than  five years \u00a3m                    | Over  five years  but not  more than  ten years \u00a3m                    | Over  ten years \u00a3m                                                    | Total  loans and  advances \u00a3m                                         |\n| 2020              | 384                                                                   | 171                                                                   | 132                                                                   | 398                                                                   | 3,227                                                                 | 4,357                                                                 | 1,299                                                                 | 9,969                                                                 |\n| 2019              | 254                                                                   | 146                                                                   | 111                                                                   | 377                                                                   | 3,088                                                                 | 3,687                                                                 | 1,388                                                                 | 9,051                                                                 |",

Impairment allowances rose to \u00a3707m (2019: \u00a3298m) following a small number of material single name charges in the year. Barclays International accounted for 83% of wholesale forbearance with corporate cases representing 82% of all forborne balances.\n\nRetail balances on forbearance increased 32%, reflecting an increase in Barclays UK and Barclays International.",

b  On 1 April 2020, the Barclays Partner Finance business moved from Barclays International to Barclays UK. The 2019 comparative figures have not been restated.\n- a For 2020 year end, there has been a standardisation of the definition of forbearance across the Group. 2019 balances have not been restated.\n\nUK home loans: forbearance balances reduced to \u00a3135m (2019: 137m) due to availability of payment holidays for those in short term financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of payment holidays does not necessitate the reclassification of assets as forborne.\n\nUK personal loans: gross balances on forbearance programmes remained stable at \u00a354m (2019: \u00a354m) due to the impact of customers utilising temporary COVID-19 relief instead of longer term forbearance options offset by \u00a39m due to the impact of the standardisation of the definition of forbearance.\n\nUK cards: gross balances on forbearance programmes increased to \u00a3384m (2019: \u00a3254m) due to increasing numbers of customers utilising breathing space during the pandemic and \u00a3101m due to the impact of the standardisation of the definition of forbearance.\n\nBarclays partner finance: gross balances on forbearance programmes remained broadly stable.\n\nGermany consumer lending: forbearance balances increased to \u00a367m (2019: \u00a337m) due to the impact of the standardisation of the definition of forbearance.\n\nUS cards: forbearance balances increased to \u00a3286m (2019: \u00a3183m) due to the impact of the standardisation of the definition of forbearance of \u00a3143m partially offset by the impact of fewer forbearance enrolments.\n\nItalian home loans: forbearance balances reduced to \u00a3126m (2019: \u00a3130m) due to a natural exit from forbearance status as the portfolio is in run-off.",

Similarly, derivative liabilities would be \u00a3276bn (2019: \u00a3212bn) lower reflecting counterparty netting and collateral placed. In addition, non-cash collateral of \u00a35bn (2019: \u00a36bn) was held in respect of derivative assets. The Group received collateral from clients in support of over the counter derivative transactions. These transactions are generally undertaken under International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements governed by either UK or New York law.\n\nThe table below sets out the fair value and

The market risk management section provides a description of management VaR.\n\n## Measures of market risk in the Group and accounting measures\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 balance sheet measures show accrualsbased balances or marked to market values as at the reporting date\n\nTraded market risk measures such as VaR and balance sheet exposure measures have fundamental differences:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 VaR measures also take account of current marked to market values, but in addition hedging effects between positions are considered\n\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to present direct reconciliations of traded market risk and accounting measures.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 market risk measures are expressed in terms of changes in value or volatilities as opposed to static values.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nAverage management VaR increased to \u00a332m in 2020 (2019: \u00a323m), driven by an increase in market volatility in late Q1 and Q2 during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management VaR stabilised and declined in the second half of the year.\n\n## Traded market risk review\n\nThe following disclosures provide details on management measures of market risk. Refer to the market risk management section of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited) for more detail on management measures and the differences when compared to regulatory measures.\n\n## Review of management measures\n\nThe table below shows the total management VaR on a diversified basis by risk factor. Total management VaR includes all trading positions in CIB and Treasury and it is calculated with a one-day holding period.\n\nLimits are applied against each risk factor VaR as well as total management VaR, which are then cascaded further by risk managers to each business.",

Historical correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments. The high and low VaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole. Consequently, a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business scenario stresses\n\nIn 2020, the scenario analyses showed that the largest market risk related impacts would be due to a severe deterioration in financial liquidity and an associated global recession.\n\nAs part of the Group's risk management framework, on a regular basis the performance of the trading business in hypothetical scenarios characterised by severe macroeconomic conditions is modelled. Up to seven global scenarios are modelled on a regular basis, for example, a sharp deterioration in liquidity, a slowdown in the global economy, global recession, and a sharp increase in economic growth.",

The Liquidity Framework meets the PRA's standards and is designed to maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount and quality, and a funding profile that is appropriate to meet the liquidity risk appetite. The Liquidity Framework is delivered via a combination of policy formation, review and governance, analysis, stress testing, limit setting and monitoring.\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's: (i) summary of performance, (ii) liquidity risk stress testing, iii) liquidity pool, (iv) funding structure and funding relationships, (v) credit ratings, and (vi) contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nFor further detail on liquidity risk governance and framework, refer to page 194 to 197 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).\n\nKey metrics Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n162\n\n%\n\n## Summary of performance\n\nDuring the year, the Group issued \u00a37.9bn of minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) instruments in a range of tenors and currencies.\n\nThe liquidity pool at \u00a3266bn (December 2019: \u00a3211bn) reflects the Group's prudent approach to liquidity management. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) remained well above the 100% regulatory requirement at 162% (December 2019: 160%), equivalent to a surplus of \u00a399bn (December 2019: \u00a378bn). The increase in the liquidity pool, LCR and surplus over the year was driven by a 16% growth in deposits, which was largely a consequence of government and central bank policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction in Q420 reflects actions taken to manage down surplus liquidity proactively as the prevailing uncertainty from earlier in the year abated.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term and medium-term notes markets and Barclays Bank UK PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintains an active secured funding programme. This funding capacity enables the respective entities maintain their stable and diversified funding bases.\n\nThe Group's reliance on short-term wholesale funding, as measured by the proportion of wholesale funding maturing in less than one year was broadly flat year on year. At 31 December 2020, it was 29% (December 2019: 28%).\n\n## Liquidity risk stress testing\n\n## Liquidity risk appetite\n\nUnder the Liquidity Framework, the Group has established a liquidity risk appetite (LRA) together with the appropriate limits for the management of the liquidity risk. This is the level of liquidity risk the Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations. The Group sets its internal liquidity risk appetite based on internal liquidity risk assessments and, external regulatory requirements namely the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) LCR as amended by CRR II.\n\nThe liquidity risk assessment measures the potential contractual and contingent stress outflows under a range of stress scenarios, which are then used to determine the size of the liquidity pool that is immediately available to meet anticipated outflows should a stress occur.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 90-day market-wide stress event\n\nAs part of the LRA, the Group runs three short-term liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the PRA's prescribed stresses:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 30-day Barclays-specific stress event\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 combined 30-day market-wide and Barclays-specific stress event.",

The NSFR has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group monitors its position against the LCR, and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as defined in the CRR as amended by CRR II b .\n\nThe original LCR Delegated Act underwent a revision in April 2020 a . The key areas which were updated include rules around the recognition of securitisations as High Quality Liquid Assets (requiring them to be simple, transparent and standardised) as well as an update to the stressed inflow/ outflow rates for repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and collateral swaps. These revisions were consistent with the requirements of the Basel standards.\n\n## Regulatory developments and impact of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union LCR\n\nDetailed NSFR provisions were contained in CRR II. Barclays expects all its entities in scope of NSFR requirements to be compliant at their respective date of implementation.\n\nThe European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 c ensures 'direct EU legislation' operative in the UK immediately before 'exit day' (31 December 2020) continues to be in force unless otherwise specified. This ensures that the LCR provisions operative in the UK before 'exit day' contained in the CRR (as amended by CRR II) and LCR Delegated Act continue to apply in the UK subject to the temporary transitional powers (TTP) available to UK regulators to delay or phase-in onshoring changes.\n\n## NSFR\n\nThe relief made available under the TTP extends to the recognition of EU member states' sovereign debt as Level 1 HQLA d up to 31 March 2022 unless the relevant equivalence decision is made earlier.\n\nThe NSFR rules were not operative in the UK prior to 'exit day' and therefore they were not automatically onshored into UK domestic law and the UK is under no direct obligation to align to the requirements contained in CRR II. Instead the NSFR will be subject to implementation by the UK's PRA.\n\nThis does not apply to Barclays Bank Ireland (BBI) which remains subject to the NSFR requirements as set out in CRR II due to be implemented in June 2021.\n\nIn November 2020 the PRA published a joint statement with HM Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority e that the implementation of the outstanding provisions of CRR II in the UK would be moved from June 2021 to January 2022. The PRA intends to consult during the course of 2021 which will determine how closely implementation of the NSFR in the UK will align with the EU requirements of CRR II.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Capital Requirements Regulation II (CRRII): Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/87.\n- a Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 of 10 October 2014 to supplement Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and Council with regard to liquidity coverage requirement for Credit Institutions, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and as amended from time to time.\n- c Section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n- e  Joint statement on the implementation of prudential reforms in the Financial Services Bill.\n- d  Part 15 of 'Capital Requirements Regulation: Guidance on the PRA's use of the transitional direction'.\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio\n\nThe external LCR requirement is prescribed by the regulator taking into account the relative stability of different sources of funding and potential incremental funding requirements in a stress.\n\n| As at 31 December         | 2020 \u00a3bn   | 2019 \u00a3bn   |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Eligible liquidity buffer | 258        | 206        |\n| Net stress outflows       | (159)      | (128)      |\n| Surplus                   | 99         | 78         |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio  | 162%       | 160%       |\n\nAs part of the LRA, Barclays also establishes the minimum LCR limit. The Group plans to maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory stress requirements at an efficient level, while continuously assessing risks to market funding conditions and its liquidity position and taking actions to manage the size of the liquidity pool as appropriate.",

The residual portion of the liquidity pool is held outside of these entities, predominantly in the US subsidiaries, to meet entity-specific stress outflows and local regulatory requirements. To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to local regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group in calculating the LCR.\n\nThe composition of the liquidity pool is subject to limits set by the Board and the independent liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk functions. In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type. Given the returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.\n\n## Contingent liquidity\n\nIn a Barclays-specific, market-wide or combined liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted. In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at significantly elevated prices, the Group could generate liquidity via central bank facilities. To this end, as at 31 December 2020, the Group had \u00a399.2bn (December 2019: \u00a379.7bn) of assets prepositioned at various central banks.\n\nIn addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity. While these are not relied on in the Group's LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through their use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.\n\nFor more detail on the Group's other unencumbered assets, see pages 221 to 223 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).",

As such, retail and corporate loans and advances are largely funded by deposits in the relevant entities, with the surplus primarily funding the liquidity pool. The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements. Derivative liabilities and assets are largely matched. A substantial proportion of balance sheet derivative positions qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset when netted against cash collateral received and paid. Wholesale debt and equity is used to fund residual assets.\n\nThe basis for sound liquidity risk management is a funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due. The Group's overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base (geographically, by type and by counterparty) and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.\n\nThese funding relationships are summarised below:\n\n| Assets                                                                                             | 2020 \u00a3bn   | 2019 \u00a3bn   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost a                                                             | 335        | 335        |\n| Group liquidity pool                                                                               | 266        | 211        |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements,  trading portfolio assets, cash collateral  and settlement balances | 376        | 298        |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                                   | 302        | 229        |\n| Other assets b                                                                                     | 71         | 67         |\n| Total assets                                                                                       | 1,350      | 1,140      |\n\n| Liabilities                                                                                       | 2020 \u00a3bn   | 2019 \u00a3bn   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Deposits at amortised cost                                                                        | 481        | 416        |\n| <1 Year wholesale funding                                                                         | 43         | 41         |\n| >1 Year wholesale funding                                                                         | 102        | 106        |\n| Repurchase agreements,   trading portfolio liabilities, cash collateral   and settlement balances | 324        | 247        |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                                  | 301        | 229        |\n| Other liabilities                                                                                 | 32         | 35         |\n| Equity                                                                                            | 67         | 66         |\n| Total liabilities                                                                                 | 1,350      | 1,140      |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Other assets include fair value assets that are not part of reverse repurchase agreements or trading portfolio assets, and other asset categories.\n- a Adjusted for liquidity pool debt securities reported at amortised costs of \u00a38bn (December 2019: \u00a34bn).\n\n## Deposit funding (audited)\n\n|                               | 2020                                    | 2020                         | 2020                 | 2019           |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Funding of loans and advances | Loans and  advances at  amortised  cost | Deposits at  amortised  cost | Loan:  deposit ratio | Loan:  deposit |\n| As at 31 December 2020        | \u00a3bn                                     | \u00a3bn                          | a %                  | ratio %        |\n| Barclays UK                   | 214                                     | 240                          | 89%                  | 96%            |\n| Barclays International        | 123                                     | 241                          | 51%                  | 63%            |\n| Head Office                   | 6                                       | -                            |                      |                |\n| Barclays Group                | 343                                     | 481                          | 71%                  | 82%            |\n\n## Note\n\n- a The loan: deposit ratio is calculated as loans and advances at amortised cost divided by deposits at amortised cost.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, \u00a3209bn (2019: \u00a3181bn) of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and other similar schemes. In addition to these customer deposits \u00a32bn (2019: \u00a34bn) of other liabilities are insured by other governments.\n\nThe Group's broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances and hence provides a stable funding base for the Group's operations and liquidity needs.\n\nContractually current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice. In practice, their observed maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity. Similarly, repayment profiles of certain types of assets e.g. mortgages, overdrafts and credit card lending, differ from their contractual profiles. The Group therefore assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer assets and liabilities to identify structural balance sheet funding gaps. In doing so, it applies quantitative modelling and qualitative assessments which take into account historical experience, current customer composition, and macroeconomic projections.\n\n## Wholesale funding\n\nBarclays Bank Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and to long-term investors through its clients worldwide. Key sources of wholesale funding include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, mediumterm issuances (including structured notes) and securitisations.\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group maintain access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, short-term funding markets and repo markets.",

Barclays Bank UK PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintains an active secured funding programme. This funding capacity enables the respective entities maintain their stable and diversified funding bases.\n\nThe Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt from Barclays PLC (the Parent company), in order to maintain compliance with indicative MREL requirements and maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and market. During the year, the Group issued \u00a37.9bn of MREL instruments from Barclays PLC (the Parent company) in a range of different currencies and tenors.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group's total wholesale funding outstanding (excluding repurchase agreements) was \u00a3145.0bn (2019: \u00a3147.1bn), of which \u00a317.1bn (2019: \u00a319.6bn) was secured funding and \u00a3127.9bn (2019: \u00a3127.5bn) unsecured funding. Unsecured funding includes \u00a354.8bn (2019: \u00a351.1bn) of privately placed senior unsecured notes issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group also support various central bank monetary initiatives, such as the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme (TFS) and Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME), and the European Central Bank's Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO). These are reported under 'repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing' on the balance sheet.\n\nWholesale funding of \u00a342.7bn (2019: \u00a340.6bn matures in less than one year, representing 29% (December 2019: 28%) of total wholesale funding outstanding. This includes \u00a320.3bn (2019: \u00a316.3bn) related to term funding b . Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded the wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by \u00a3223bn (2019: \u00a3170bn).\n\nIn 2020, Barclays repaid \u00a311.2bn of TFS drawings early, reducing the outstanding drawn balance under TFS to \u00a31.4bn as at 31 December 2020.

These ratings assess the creditworthiness of the Group, its subsidiaries and its branches, and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial attributes including capital strength, profitability, funding, liquidity, asset quality, strategy and governance.\n\n| Credit ratings As at 31 December 2020   | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's                     | Fitch           |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n| Barclays Bank PLC                       |                     |                             |                 |\n| Long term                               | A / Negative        | A1 / Stable                 | A+ / Negative a |\n| Short term                              | A-1                 | P-1                         | F1              |\n| Barclays Bank UK PLC                    |                     |                             |                 |\n| Long term                               | A / Negative        | A1 / Negative               | A+ / Negative   |\n| Short term                              | A-1                 | P-1                         | F1              |\n| Barclays PLC                            |                     |                             |                 |\n| Long term                               |                     | BBB / Negative Baa2 /Stable | A / Negative    |\n| Short term                              | A-2                 | P-2                         | F1              |\n\n## Note\n\n- a Rating Watch Negative\n\nIn January 2020 Moody's upgraded the long-term ratings of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC by one notch to Baa2 and A1 respectively, due to their view that the earnings profile of the entities has improved. This followed the positive outlooks that had been placed on these entities in May 2019 and the outlooks reverted to stable in the most recent action.\n\nIn April 2020, S&P affirmed all ratings for Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC, whilst revising the outlooks for Barclays and its subsidiaries to negative from stable, alongside many European peers, to reflect economic and market stress triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn April 2020, Fitch revised the outlooks of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC to Rating Watch Negative (RWN) from stable, while the outlook for Barclays Bank UK PLC was revised to negative from stable, alongside UK peers, to reflect the downside risks to their credit profiles resulting from the economic and financial market implications of the COVID-19 outbreak. In October 2020, Fitch removed the RWNs on the ratings of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC and revised the outlook to Negative, whilst affirming the rating of Barclays Bank UK PLC.\n\nBarclays also solicits issuer ratings from R&I and the ratings of A- for Barclays PLC and A for Barclays Bank PLC were affirmed in November 2020 with stable outlooks.\n\nThe contractual collateral requirement following one- and two-notch long-term and associated short-term downgrades across all credit rating agencies, would result in outflows of \u00a32bn and \u00a34bn respectively, and are provided for in determining an appropriate liquidity pool size given the Group's liquidity risk appetite. These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements. These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity. However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.\n\nA credit rating downgrade could result in outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts. Outflows related to credit rating downgrades are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk. Credit ratings downgrades could also result in reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs.",

Derivatives (other than those designated in a hedging relationship) and trading portfolio assets and liabilities are included in the 'on demand' column at their fair value. Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for settlement according to such maturity and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value. Derivatives designated in a hedging relationship are included according to their contractual maturity.\n\n| Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)                        | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   | Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities (audited)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| As at  31 December 2020                                              | On demand \u00a3m                                                         | Not more than three months \u00a3m                                                             | Over three months but not more than six months \u00a3m                    | Over six months but not more than nine  months \u00a3m                    | Over nine months but not more than one  year \u00a3m                      | Over one year  but not more than two years \u00a3m                        | Over two years but not more than three years \u00a3m                      | Over three years but not more than five years \u00a3m                     | Over five years but not more than ten years                          | Over ten years \u00a3m                                                    | Total \u00a3m                                                             |\n| Assets                                                               |                                                                      |                                                                                           |                                                                      |                                                                      |                                                                      |                                                                      |                                                                      |                                                                      | \u00a3m                                                                   |                                                                      |                                                                      |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                   | 190,347                                                              | 182                                                                                       | 598                                                                  | -

        "page_content": "## Capital risk\n\nAll disclosures in this section are unaudited unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe CET1 ratio, among other metrics, is a measure of the capital strength and resilience of Barclays. Maintenance of our capital resources is vital in order to meet the overall regulatory capital requirement, to withstand the impact of the risks that may arise under normal and stressed conditions, and to cover current and forecast business needs and associated risks to provide a viable and sustainable business offering.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the Group's: (i) CET1 capital, leverage and own funds and eligible liabilities requirements; (ii) capital resources; (iii) risk weighted assets (RWAs); (iv) leverage ratios and exposures; and (v) own funds and eligible liabilities.\n\nMore details on monitoring and managing capital risk may be found in the risk management sections of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).\n\n## Key metrics\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage UK leverage ratio\n\n## 15.1 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUK leverage ratio\n\n5.0 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOwn funds and eligible liabilities ratio as a percentage of CRR leverage exposures a\n\n## 5.3 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOwn funds and eligible liabilities ratio as a percentage of RWAs\n\n## 8.2 %\n\n## 33.6 % Note\n\n- a Fully loaded CRR leverage exposure is calculated without applying the transitional arrangements of the CRR as amended by CRR II.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nThe CET1 ratio increased to 15.1% (December 2019: 13.8%).\n\nThe Group continues to be in excess of overall capital requirements, minimum leverage requirements and MREL requirements.\n\nCET1 capital increased by \u00a35.5bn to \u00a346.3bn reflecting resilient capital generation through \u00a37.9bn of profit before tax, excluding credit impairment charges of \u00a34.8bn, and a \u00a31.0bn increase due to the cancellation of the full year 2019 dividend. These increases were partially offset by \u00a30.9bn of AT1 coupons paid and the announced 1.0p full year 2020 dividend. The CET1 capital increase also reflects regulatory measures for IFRS 9 transitional relief, prudent valuation and qualifying software assets.\n\nThe average UK leverage ratio increased to 5.0% (December 2019: 4.5%) primarily driven by the increase in T1 capital. The average leverage exposure increased to \u00a31,147bn (December 2019: \u00a31,143bn) primarily driven by an increase in Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) and Trading Portfolio Assets (TPAs) largely driven by an increase in secured lending and client activity within CIB, partially offset by the PRA's early adoption of CRR II settlement netting.\n\nRWAs increased by \u00a311.1bn to \u00a3306.2bn primarily due to higher market volatility, increased client activity and a reduction in credit quality within CIB, partially offset by lower consumer lending.\n\n## Minimum capital requirements\n\nThe Group's CCyB is based on the buffer rate applicable for each jurisdiction in which the Group has exposures. On 11 March 2020, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) set the CCyB rate for UK exposures at 0% with immediate effect. The buffer rates set by other national authorities for non-UK exposures are not currently material. Overall, this results in a 0.0% CCyB for the Group.\n\nThe Group's Overall Capital Requirement for CET1 is 11.2% comprising a 4.5% Pillar 1 minimum, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), a 1.5% Global Systemically Important Institution (G-SII) buffer, a 2.7% Pillar 2A requirement and a 0.0% Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).\n\nThe Group's Pillar 2A requirement as per the PRA's Individual Capital Requirement is 4.8% of which at least 56.25% needs to be met with CET1 capital, equating to approximately 2.7% of RWAs. The Pillar 2A requirement is subject to at least annual review and has been set as a nominal capital amount. This is based on a point in time assessment and the requirement (when expressed as a proportion of RWAs) will change depending on the total RWAs at each reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review: Treasury and Capital risk\n\n## Risk performance continued\n\n## Minimum leverage requirements\n\nThe Group is subject to a leverage ratio requirement of 3.8% as at 31 December 2020. This comprises the 3.25% minimum requirement, a G-SII additional leverage ratio buffer (G-SII ALRB) of 0.53% and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer of 0.0%. Although the leverage ratio is expressed in terms of T1 capital, 75% of the minimum requirement, equating to 2.4375%, needs to be met with CET1 capital. In addition, the G-SII ALRB must be covered solely with CET1 capital. The CET1 capital held against the 0.53% G-SII ALRB was \u00a36.0bn.\n\n## Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities\n\nOn 19 January 2021 the BoE published indicative MREL requirements that show the Group's highest requirement in 2022 will be 7.70% of CRR leverage exposure, based on 30 September 2020 exposures. The BoE is currently reviewing the MREL calibration and intends to make any policy changes by the end of 2021. Separately, the FPC intends to review the UK leverage framework in 2021 and this, along with any MREL policy changes, may result in a different MREL requirement from 1 January 2022 than that which is currently proposed. CET1 capital cannot be counted towards both MREL and the capital buffers, meaning that the buffers will effectively be applied above MREL requirements.\n\nThe Group is required to meet the higher of: (i) the requirements set by the BoE based on RWAs and the higher of average and UK leverage exposures; and (ii) the requirements in CRR as amended by CRR II based on RWAs and CRR leverage exposures. The MREL requirements are subject to phased implementation and will be fully implemented by 1 January 2022.\n\n## Significant regulatory updates in the period\n\nThe following regulatory updates formed part of CRR as amended by CRR II prior to 31 December 2020 and subsequently form part of UK law as defined above.\n\nUnder the withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU, the 11-month transition period expired at 11pm on 31 December 2020. Any references to CRR as amended by CRR II mean, unless otherwise specified, CRR as amended by CRR II, as it forms part of UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and subject to the TTP available to UK regulators to delay or phase-in onshoring changes to UK regulatory requirements arising at the end of the transition period until 31 March 2022, as at the applicable reporting date. Throughout the TTP period, the BoE and PRA are expected to review the UK legislation framework and any disclosures made by the Group will be subject to any resulting guidance.\n\nOn 22 April 2020, the regulatory technical standards on prudent valuation were amended to include an increase to diversification factors applied to certain additional valuation adjustments. The amendments temporarily reduced the additional value adjustment deduction (PVA) and were applied until 31 December 2020 inclusive.\n\nOn 27 June 2020, CRR as amended by CRR II, was further amended to accelerate specific CRR II measures and implement a new IFRS 9 transitional relief calculation. Previously due to be implemented in June 2021, the accelerated measures primarily relate to non-deduction of prudently valued software assets from CET1 capital, the CRR leverage calculation to include additional settlement netting and limited changes to the calculation of RWAs. For UK leverage calculations, the PRA early adopted the CRR II settlement netting measure in April 2020.\n\nOn 23 December 2020, a new regulatory technical standard on the prudential treatment of qualifying software assets was adopted into EU law replacing the CET1 capital deduction with prudential amortisation up to a 3-year period.  Intangible assets that are no longer deducted are subject to 100% risk weight instead.\n\nThe IFRS 9 transitional arrangements have been extended by two years and a new modified calculation has been introduced. 100% relief will be applied to increases in stage 1 and stage 2 provisions from 1 January 2020 throughout 2020 and 2021; 75% in 2022; 50% in 2023; 25% in 2024 with no relief applied from 2025. The phasing out of transitional relief on the 'day 1' impact of IFRS 9 as well as increases in stage 1 and stage 2 provisions between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2019 under the modified calculation remain unchanged and continue to be subject to 70% transitional relief throughout 2020; 50% for 2021; 25% for 2022 and with no relief applied from 2023.\n\nFollowing its stated intention to consult, on 12 February 2021 the PRA launched a consultation on certain items within the Basel standards that remain to be implemented in the UK as well as setting out proposed new PRA CRR rules.  The proposals include reverting to the previous treatment of 100% CET1 capital deduction for qualifying software assets by the end of 2021, meaning the benefit in the CET1 ratio is likely to be reversed in future periods.",

Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.\n\nFunctional currency of operations (audited)\n\n|                        | Foreign  currency net  investments \u00a3m   | Borrowings  which hedge  the net  investments \u00a3m   | Derivatives  which hedge  the net  investments \u00a3m   | Structural  currency  exposures  pre-economic  hedges \u00a3m   | Economic  hedges \u00a3m   | Remaining  structural  currency  exposures \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2020 |                                         |                                                    |                                                     |                                                            |                       |                                                 |\n| USD                    | 24,204                                  | (7,666)                                            | (764)                                               | 15,774                                                     | (6,193)               | 9,581                                           |\n| EUR                    | 5,275                                   | (952)                                              | (3)                                                 | 4,320                                                      | (286)                 | 4,034                                           |\n| JPY                    | 582                                     | -                                                  | -                                                   | 582                                                        | -                     | 582                                             |\n| Other currencies       | 2,020                                   | (42)                                               | (24)                                                | 1,954                                                      | -                     | 1,954                                           |\n| Total                  | 32,081                                  | (8,660)                                            | (791)                                               | 22,630                                                     | (6,479)               | 16,151                                          |\n| As at 31 December 2019 |                                         |                                                    |                                                     |                                                            |                       |                                                 |\n| USD                    | 25,607                                  | (10,048)                                           | (1,111)                                             | 14,448                                                     | (5,339)               | 9,109                                           |\n| EUR                    | 3,068                                   | (3)                                                | -                                                   | 3,065                                                      | (1,122)               | 1,943                                           |\n| JPY                    | 533                                     | -                                                  | -                                                   | 533                                                        | -                     | 533                                             |\n| Other currencies       | 2,001                                   | -                                                  | (34)                                                | 1,967                                                      | -                     | 1,967                                           |\n| Total                  | 31,209                                  | (10,051)                                           | (1,145)                                             | 20,013                                                     | (6,461)               | 13,552                                          |\n\nEconomic hedges relate to exposures arising on foreign currency denominated preference share and AT1 instruments. These are accounted for at historical cost under IFRS and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. The gain or loss arising from changes in the GBP value of these instruments is recognised on redemption in retained earnings.\n\nDuring 2020, total structural currency exposure net of hedging instruments increased by \u00a32.6bn to \u00a316.2bn (2019: \u00a313.6bn). Foreign currency net investments increased by \u00a30.9bn to \u00a332.1bn (2019: \u00a331.2bn) driven predominantly by a \u00a32.2bn increase in EUR, \u00a30.1bn increase in other currencies offset by a \u00a31.4bn decrease in USD. The hedges associated with these investments decreased by \u00a31.7bn to \u00a39.5bn (2019: \u00a311.2bn).\n\n## Pension risk review\n\nRefer to the Management of pension risk section in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited) for more information on how pension risk is managed.\n\nThe UK Retirement Fund (UKRF) represents approximately 97% (2019: 97%) of the Group's total retirement benefit obligations globally. As such this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF. The UKRF is closed to new entrants and there is no new final salary benefit being accrued. Existing active members accrue a combination of a cash balance benefit and a defined contribution element. Pension risk arises as the market value of the pension fund assets may decline, investment returns may reduce or the estimated value of the pension liabilities may increase.\n\n## Assets\n\nThe Trustee Board of the UKRF defines its overall long-term investment strategy with investments across a broad range of asset classes. This results in an appropriate mix of return seeking assets as well as liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations. The two largest market risks within the asset portfolio are interest rates and equities. The split of scheme assets is shown within Note 33. The fair value of the UKRF assets was \u00a333.9bn as at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a331.4bn).",

        "page_content": "## Liabilities\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 an increase in long-term expected inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities\n\nThe UKRF retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term price inflation rate (RPI) and the discount rate (GBP AA corporate bond yield):\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a decrease in the discount rate corresponds to an increase in liabilities.\n\nFor more detail on the UKRF's financial and demographic assumptions, see Note 33 to the financial statements.\n\nPension risk is generated through the Group's defined benefit schemes and this risk is set to reduce over time as the main defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants. The chart below outlines the shape of the UKRF's liability cash flow profile as at 31 December 2020 that takes account of the future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries. The majority of the cash flows (approximately 95%) fall between 0 and 40 years, peaking between 11 and 20 years and reducing thereafter. The shape may vary depending on changes to inflation and longevity expectations and any members who elect to transfer out. Transfers out will bring forward the liability cash flows.\n\n## Proportion of liability cash flows\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph above shows the evolution of the UKRF's net IAS 19 position over the last two years. During 2020 the reduction in the IAS 19 position was driven by the net effect of bank contributions and a structured transaction agreed between the Bank and the Trustee which deferred the regulatory capital impact of the contributions until 2023-2025. Credit spreads tightening during the year had a negative impact which was broadly offset by changes in other market levels, in particular equity prices and interest rates, and updates to the discount rate methodology and demographic assumptions.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nRefer to Note 33 for the sensitivity of the UKRF to changes in key assumptions and further information on the structured transaction.\n\nIn line with Barclays' risk management framework the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility of the pension position at a total portfolio level. This enables the risks, diversification and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations and investments to be adequately captured. VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis. Risks are reviewed and reported regularly at forums including the Board Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee, the Pensions Management Group and the Pension Executive Board. The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities on an IAS 19 basis (see Note 33). The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.\n\nIn addition, the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process. Stress testing is performed internally on at least an annual basis. The UKRF exposure is also included as part of regulatory stress tests.\n\nThe pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are reviewed regularly (See Note 33 for more details). To mitigate part of this risk the UKRF has entered into a longevity swap hedging approximately a quarter of current pensioner liabilities.\n\nBarclays defined benefit pension schemes affects capital in two ways:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 in the Group's statutory balance sheet an IAS 19 surplus or deficit is partially offset by a deferred tax liability or asset respectively. These may or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of the Group at the particular time.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 an IAS 19 deficit is treated as a liability on the Group's balance sheet. Movement in a deficit due to remeasurements, including actuarial losses, are recognised immediately through Other Comprehensive Income and as such reduces shareholders' equity and CET1 capital. An IAS 19 surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders' equity; however, it is deducted for the purposes of determining CET1 capital\n\nPension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually. The Pillar 2A requirement forms part of the Group's Overall Capital Requirement for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital. More detail on minimum regulatory requirements can be found in the Overall capital requirements section.",

The potential volatility of net interest income is measured by an Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR) metric which is monitored regularly and reported to senior management and the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee as part of the limit monitoring framework.\n\nFor further detail on the interest rate risk in the banking book governance and framework refer to pages 199 to 200 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020 (unaudited).\n\n## Key metrics\n\nAEaR across the Group from a negative 25bps shock to forward interest rate curves.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nNII sensitivity to a -25bp shock to rates has increased year on year due to additional margin compression exposure driven by central bank rate cuts and growth in customer deposit balances through the year. The increased margin compression exposure is partially mitigated by hedging and potential margin decompression benefit on variable rate loans.\n\n## Net interest income sensitivity\n\nThe table below shows a sensitivity analysis on pre-tax net interest income for non-traded\n\nThe main model assumptions are: (i) one-year ahead time horizon; (ii) balance sheet is held constant; (iii) balances are adjusted for assumed behavioural profiles (i.e. considers that customers may prepay the mortgages before the contractual maturity); and (iv) behavioural assumptions are kept unchanged in all rate scenarios.\n\n| Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by business unit a  (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by business unit a  (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by business unit a  (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by business unit a  (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by business unit a  (audited)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                        | Barclays UK \u00a3m                                                         | Barclays  International \u00a3m                                             | Head Office \u00a3m                                                         | Total \u00a3m                                                               |\n| As at 31 December 2020                                                 |                                                                        |                                                                        |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| +25bps                                                                 | 10                                                                     | 86                                                                     | 4                                                                      | 100                                                                    |\n| -25bps                                                                 | (141)                                                                  | (263)                                                                  | (4)                                                                    | (408)                                                                  |\n| As at 31 December 2019                                                 |                                                                        |                                                                        |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| +25bps                                                                 | 16                                                                     | 25                                                                     | 4                                                                      | 45                                                                     |\n| -25bps                                                                 | (57)                                                                   | (74)                                                                   | (4)                                                                    | (135)                                                                  |\n\n## Note\n\n- a The Group's customer banking book hedging activity is risk reducing from an NII sensitivity perspective. The hedges in place remove interest rate risk and smooth income over the medium term. The NII sensitivity for the Group at 31 December 2020 without hedging in place for +/-25bp rate shocks would be \u00a3177m/\u00a3(485)m respectively.\n\nNII sensitivity asymmetry arises due to the current low level of interest rates as some customer products have embedded floors. NII sensitivity to a -25bp shock to rates has increased year on year due to additional margin compression exposure driven by central bank rate cuts and growth in customer deposit balances through the year. NII Sensitivity to a +25bps shock has increased year on year primarily driven by the growth in customer deposit balances.\n\n| Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by currency (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by currency (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by currency (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by currency (audited)   | Net interest income sensitivity (AEaR) by currency (audited)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                | 2020                                                           | 2020                                                           | 2019                                                           | 2019                                                           |\n| As at 31 December                                              | +25 basis points \u00a3m                                            | -25 basis points \u00a3m                                            | +25 basis points \u00a3m                                            | -25 basis points \u00a3m                                            |\n| GBP                                                            | 48                                                             | (313)                                                          | 38                                                             | (93)                                                           |\n| USD                                                            | 48                                                             | (63)                                                           | 29                                                             | (32)                                                           |\n| EUR                                                            | 10                                                             | (34)                                                           | (10)                                                           | (20)                                                           |\n| Other currencies                                               | (6)                                                            | 2                                                              | (12)                                                           | 10                                                             |\n| Total                                                          | 100                                                            | (408)                                                          | 45                                                             | (135)                                                          |\n\n## AEaR -\u00a3408 m\n\nfinancial assets and liabilities, including the effect of any hedging.

However, movements in the pensions remeasurement reserve recognised in FVOCI only affect CET1 capital if there is an IAS 19 pension deficit. Movements in the cash flow hedge reserve do not affect CET1 capital.\n\n## Volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool\n\nAlthough the underlying methodology to calculate the non-traded VaR is identical to the one used in traded management VaR, the two measures are not directly comparable. The non-traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the FVOCI exposures. These exposures are in the banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.\n\nChanges in value of FVOCI exposures flow directly through capital via the FVOCI reserve. The volatility of the value of the FVOCI investments in the liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i.e. non-traded market risk VaR.\n\nAnalysis of volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool\n\n|                                              | 2020    | 2020   | 2020   | 2019    | 2019   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|\n|                                              | Average | High   | Low    | Average | High   | Low    |\n| For the year ended 31 December               | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     |\n| Non-traded market value at risk (daily, 95%) | 52      | 68     | 36     | 45      | 53     | 35     |\n\nDVaR trended upwards in H1 2020 due to an increase in time series volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic stress.

These represent threats to the Group that extend across multiple risk types, and therefore require an integrated risk management approach.\n\nFor definitions of these risks refer to pages 202 to 203 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2020. In order to provide complete coverage of the potential adverse impacts on the Group arising from operational risk, the operational risk taxonomy extends beyond the risks listed above to cover operational risks associated with other principal risks too.\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's operational risk profile, including events above the Group's reportable threshold, which have had a financial impact in 2020. The Group's operational risk profile is informed by bottom-up risk assessments undertaken by each business unit and top-down qualitative review by the Operational Risk specialists for each risk type. Fraud, Transaction Operations, Information Security and Technology continue to be highlighted as key operational risk exposures.\n\nFor information on conduct risk events, see the conduct risk section.\n\n## Key metrics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the Group's net reportable operational risk events had a loss value of \u00a350,000 or less\n\n## 79 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n72 % of events by number are due to External Fraud\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof losses are from events aligned to Execution, Delivery and Process Management\n\n## 68 %\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nDuring 2020, total operational risk losses a increased to \u00a3212m (2019: \u00a3184m) while the number of recorded events for 2020 (2,381) increased slightly from the level for 2019 (2,165). The total operational risk losses for the year were mainly driven by events falling within the Execution, Delivery & Process Management and External Fraud categories, which tend to be high volume but low impact events.\n\n## Operational risk profile\n\nWithin operational risk, there are a large number of smaller value risk events. In 2020, 79% (2019: 83%) of the Group's reportable operational risk events by volume had a value of less than \u00a350,000 each. Cumulatively, events under this \u00a350,000 threshold accounted for only 17% (2019: 18%) of the Group's total net operational risk losses. A small proportion of operational risk events have a material impact on the financial results of the Group.",

Particular areas of focus include new and enhanced fraud prevention systems and tools to combat the increasing level of fraud attempts being made and to minimise any disruption to genuine transactions. Fraud remains an industry wide threat and the Group continues to work closely with external partners on various prevention initiatives.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group experienced operational disruptions primarily during the Group's and its suppliers' transition to a Work-from-Home environment and in response to high market volatility. Further, the prolonged nature of the event identified the need to enhance our resilience planning programme to improve our response to similar events with an extreme and prolonged impact. Despite these issues, the early activation of our Crisis Leadership Team facilitated swift and decisive actions to limit and manage the impacts which resulted in normal risk exposures as reported above. For additional information on the risk exposure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the operational risk management  section.\n\nOperational Resilience is and has been a key area of focus for the Group. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most severe global health emergency the World Health Organization (WHO) has ever declared. While overall, the Group proved to be resilient, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to the Group's customers, suppliers, and staff globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced our continued focus on resilience risk.\n\nLikewise, operational risk associated with cybersecurity remains a top focus for the Group. The sophistication of threat actors continues to grow as noted by multiple external risk events observed throughout the year. Multiple ransomware attacks across the global Barclays supplier base were observed and we worked closely with the affected suppliers to manage potential impacts to the Group and its clients and customers. The Group's cybersecurity events were managed within its risk tolerances and there were limited to no loss events associated with cyber-security recorded within the event categories above. For additional information on the Bank's cybersecurity risk exposure, see the operational risk management section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, refer to the operational risk management section.",

In 2020, the framework and governance of model risk was further improved by:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 progressing the validation of low materiality models to achieve 95% target for models under governance\n\nIn 2021, MRM will continue to focus on the validation of low materiality models, further embedding of validation and governance activities and on expanding the coverage of the MRM framework to new model types.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 enhancing model risk management oversight with the establishment of dedicated MRM forums which bring together model developers, model owners and model validators.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nThe Group continues to review the role and impact of conduct risk events and issues in remuneration decisions at both the individual and business level.\n\nBarclays is committed to continuing to drive the right culture throughout all levels of the organisation. The Group will continue to enhance effective management of conduct risk and appropriately consider the relevant tools, governance and management information in decision-making processes. Focus on management of Conduct Risk is ongoing and, alongside other relevant business and control management information, the Trading Entity Conduct Risk Dashboards are a key component of this.\n\nDuring 2020, the coronavirus pandemic created new risks and heightened existing ones. To date, the Group has focused on managing the heightened inherent conduct risks and continues to monitor these as the pandemic continues.\n\nBusinesses have continued to assess the potential customer, client and market impacts of strategic change. As part of the 2020 mediumterm planning process, material conduct risks associated with strategic and financial plans were assessed.\n\nThe Group continued to incur costs in relation to litigation and conduct matters, refer to Note 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters and Note 24 Provisions for further details. Costs include customer redress and remediation, as well as fines and settlements. Resolution of these matters remains a necessary and important part of delivering the Group's strategy and an ongoing commitment to improve oversight of culture and conduct.\n\nThroughout 2020, conduct risks were raised by each business area for consideration by relevant Board level committees. These committees reviewed the risks raised and whether management's proposed actions were appropriate to mitigate the risks effectively.\n\nTrading Entity Conduct Risk Dashboards, setting out key indicators in relation to Conduct and Financial Crime, are provided to the respective Board Risk Committees and senior management. These continue to be evolved and enhanced to allow effective oversight and decision-making. Barclays has operated at the overall set tolerance for conduct risk throughout 2020. The tolerance adherence is assessed by the business areas through key indicators, which are aggregated to provide an overall risk profile rating and reported to the relevant Trading Entity Board level Committees as part of the Conduct Risk Dashboard.\n\nThe Group remains focused on the continuous improvements being made to manage risk effectively with an emphasis on enhancing governance and management information to identify risk at earlier stages.\n\n## Reputation risk\n\nBarclays is committed to identifying reputation risks and issues as early as possible and managing them appropriately. At a Group level throughout 2020, reputation risks and issues were overseen by the Board which reviews the processes and policies by which Barclays identifies and manages reputation risk. Within the Barclays Bank UK Group and the Barclays Bank Group reputation risks and issues were overseen by the respective risk and Board risk committees. The top live and emerging reputation risks and issues within the Barclays Bank UK Group and the Barclays Bank Group are included within an over-arching quarterly report at the respective Board level.\n\nThe Board reviewed risks escalated by the businesses and considered whether management's proposed actions, for example attaching conditions to proposed client transactions or increased engagement with impacted stakeholders, were appropriate to mitigate the risks effectively. The Board also received regular updates with regard to key reputation risks and issues, including: Barclays' response to the pandemic; Barclays' association with sensitive sectors; access to banking; lending practices and the resilience of key Barclays systems and processes.\n\nIn 2020, Corporate Relations received 695 referrals from across the businesses (498 referrals in 2019) for consideration. These referrals covered a variety of potentially controversial sectors and topics including, but not limited to, environmental and social risks.\n\nThe Group continued to incur costs in relation to litigation and conduct matters, refer to Note 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters and Note 24 Provisions for further details. Costs include customer redress and remediation, as well as fines and settlements. Resolution of these matters remains an ongoing commitment to improve oversight of culture and conduct and management of reputation.\n\nAs part of Barclays 2020 Medium Term Planning process, material reputation risks associated with strategic and financial plans were also assessed.\n\n## Legal risk\n\nThroughout 2020, the Group has operated within set tolerances for legal risk. Tolerance adherence is assessed through key indicators, which are also used to evaluate the legal risk profile and are reviewed, at least annually, through the relevant risk and control committees. Minimum mandatory controls to manage legal risks are set out in the legal risk standards and are subject to ongoing monitoring.\n\nThe Group remains committed to continuous improvements to manage legal risk effectively. A number of enhancements have been implemented during 2020, including a refresh of the Group-wide legal risk management framework and a review and update of the supporting legal risk policies, legal risk tolerances and risk appetite. Legal risk reporting has been enhanced both in terms of format and content. There has also been a re-write of the Groupwide legal risk mandatory training, reinforced by ongoing engagement with and education of the Group's businesses and functions by Legal Function colleagues.",

We focus particularly on UK, US and EU regulation due to the location of the Group's principal areas of business. Regulations elsewhere may also have a significant impact on the Group due to the location of its branches, subsidiaries and, in some cases, clients. For more information on the risks related to the supervision and regulation of the Group, including regulatory change, see the material existing and emerging risk entitled 'Regulatory Change agenda and impact on Business Model' in the Material existing and emerging risks section.\n\nThe Group's operations, including its overseas branches, subsidiaries and associates, are subject to a large number of rules and regulations that are a condition for authorisation to conduct banking and financial services business in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. These apply to business operations, impact financial returns and include capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, authorisation, registration and reporting requirements, restrictions on certain activities, conduct of business regulations and many others.\n\n## Supervision in the UK\n\nBarclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC are authorised credit institutions and subject to prudential supervision by the PRA and subject to conduct regulation and supervision by the FCA. The Group is also subject to prudential supervision by the PRA on a group consolidated basis. Barclays Capital Securities Limited is authorised and supervised by the PRA as a PRA-designated investment firm and subject to conduct regulation and supervision by the FCA. Barclays Execution Services Limited is an appointed representative of Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and Clydesdale Financial Services Limited.\n\nIn the UK, day-to-day regulation and supervision of the Group is divided between the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) (a division of the Bank of England (BoE)) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In addition, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) of the BoE has influence on the prudential requirements that may be imposed on the banking system through its powers of direction and recommendation.\n\nThe Group is also subject to regulatory initiatives undertaken by the UK Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), as a participant in payment systems regulated by the PSR.\n\nBoth the PRA and the FCA apply standards that either anticipate or go beyond requirements established by global or EU standards, whether in relation to capital, leverage and liquidity, resolvability and resolution or matters of conduct.\n\nThe PRA's supervision of the Group is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the collection of information by way of prudential returns or cross-firm reviews, reports obtained from skilled persons, regular supervisory visits to firms and regular meetings with management and Directors to discuss issues such as strategy, governance, financial resilience, operational resilience, risk management, and recovery and resolution.\n\nThe FCA's supervision of the UK firms in the Group is carried out through a combination of proactive engagement, regular thematic work and project work based on the FCA's sector assessments, which analyse the different areas of the market and the risks that may lie ahead.\n\nFCA supervision has focused on conduct risk and customer/client outcomes, including product design, customer behaviour, market operations, LIBOR transition, fair pricing, affordability, access to cash, and fair treatment of vulnerable customers.\n\nThe FCA and the PRA also apply the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (the SMCR) which imposes a regulatory approval, individual accountability and fitness and propriety framework in respect of senior or key individuals within relevant firms.\n\nPRA supervision has focused on capital management, credit risk management, Board effectiveness, operational resilience and resolvability.\n\nBoth the PRA and the FCA have assessed the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit on UK financial markets and customers.\n\n## Supervision in the EU\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC is licensed as a credit institution by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) and is designated as a significant institution falling under direct supervision on a solo basis by the European Central Bank (ECB) for prudential purposes. Barclays Bank Ireland PLC's EU branches are supervised by the ECB and are also subject to direct supervision for local conduct purposes by national supervisory authorities in the jurisdictions where they are established. Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is also subject to supervision by the CBI as home state or competent authority under various EU financial services directives and regulations.\n\nThe Group's operations in Europe are authorised and regulated by a combination of its home regulators and host regulators in the European countries where the Group operates.\n\n## Brexit\n\nThe EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which provides a new economic and social partnership between the EU and UK, came into force provisionally on 1 January 2021. The TCA does not cover the provision of financial services into the EU and there is no agreement on passporting, equivalence or regulatory cooperation. Therefore, UK-based entities within the Group (such as Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC) are no longer able to rely on the EU passporting framework for the provision of financial services to EU clients. Accordingly, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited have put in place new arrangements in the provision of cross-border banking and investment services to customers and counterparties in the EEA, including by servicing EEA clients through the Group's EEA hub (Barclays Bank Ireland PLC). As a ring-fenced bank, Barclays Bank UK Group products are designed for customers within the UK. In light of the UK leaving the EU, Barclays Bank UK Group has continued to review the services offered to customers in the EEA, taking into account a number of factors, including the regulatory landscape across the EEA and, where relevant, feedback from EEA regulators. As a result, it has made the decision to exit certain products and services offered to EEA customers and closure processes are ongoing. Barclays Bank UK Group continues to keep its strategy under review for its remaining EEA customers.",

        "page_content": "The EU and the UK have agreed to establish structured regulatory cooperation on financial services, with the aim of establishing a durable and stable relationship, based on a shared commitment to preserve financial stability, market integrity, and the protection of investors and consumers. The EU and the UK have committed to agreeing a Memorandum of Understanding setting out a 'framework' for regulatory cooperation in financial services by March 2021. We anticipate that consideration will be given to equivalence determinations as part of the discussions.\n\n'Onshoring' was the process of amending EU legislation and regulatory requirements in the UK so that they work in a UK-only context, including directly applicable EU legislation such as EU regulations and decisions that form part of UK law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, now that the Brexit transition period has ended.\n\nMutual equivalence decisions between the UK and EU relating to market access would allow UK-based entities within the Group to offer a restricted number of financial products and services to customers and clients based in the EEA, including permanent access to EU trading venues as well as allowing EEA based clients to access some UK originated products and services, including permanent access to UK trading venues. However, the EU equivalence regime is very different to benefiting from passporting rights; the equivalence regimes that facilitate access to customers and clients based in the EEA under EU law differ significantly in their scope, operation and impact. Equivalence decisions do not cover services to retail customers, for example. Under the current framework, equivalence decisions can be revoked at any time. To date, the EU and UK have only agreed a temporary position on mutual equivalence in relation to clearing and settlement (CCPs). In addition, HM Treasury has made certain unilateral equivalence decisions, including under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).\n\nThe onshoring process means that there are some areas where the requirements on UK firms and other regulated persons have changed. To help UK firms adapt to their new requirements, HM Treasury gave UK financial regulators the power to make transitional provisions to financial services legislation for a temporary period. This is known as the Temporary Transitional Power (TTP).\n\nThe FCA has applied the TTP on a broad basis from the end of the transition period until 31 March 2022. This means UK firms and other regulated persons do not generally need to adjust to the changes to their UK regulatory obligations brought about by onshoring straightaway, although there are some exceptions to this and obligations which have changed and which took effect from 1 January 2021 include reporting obligations under various EU financial services directives and regulations, certain requirements under the Market Abuse Regulation, issuer rules, contractual recognition of bail-in, securitisation, use of credit ratings, mortgage lending after the transition period against land in the EEA, payments services and certain other matters.\n\nOn 31 December, the FCA published a statement on its use of the TTP to modify the UK's derivatives trading obligation (the UK DTO). Without mutual equivalence, some firms and EEA clients will be caught by a conflict of law between the EU DTO and the UK DTO. The FCA is therefore using the TTP to modify the application of the UK DTO. Where firms that are subject to the UK DTO trade with, or on behalf of, EU clients that are subject to the EU DTO, they will be able to transact or execute those trades on EU venues providing that: (i) firms take reasonable steps to be satisfied the client does not have arrangements in place to execute the trade on a trading venue to which both the UK and EU have granted equivalence (for example, a US venue such as a swap execution facility); and (ii) the EU venue has the necessary regulatory status to do business in the UK (such venues include those that are a Recognised Overseas Investment Exchange, have been granted the relevant temporary permission, or are certain that they benefit from the Overseas Person Exclusion). This modification of the application of the UK DTO applies to UK firms, EU firms using the UK's temporary permissions regime, and branches of overseas firms in the UK. Transactions concluded by an EEA UCITS fund or an EEA AIF are currently outside the scope of the UK DTO. The relief under the TTP does not apply to trades with non-EU clients, proprietary trading conducted, for example, to hedge a firm's own risk exposure, and trades between UK branches of EU firms. These trades remain subject to the UK DTO and firms are required to take reasonable steps to ensure compliance during Q1 2021. The FCA will consider by 31 March 2021 whether market or regulatory developments warrant a review of its approach.\n\nOn 28 December 2020, the PRA published a policy statement (PS30/20) on changes to its rules, as well as the use of temporary transitional directions. The PRA's transitional direction and the majority of the provisions in the rulebook instrument came into force at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. The transitional direction delays onshoring changes that fall within the PRA's remit. The PRA TTP will apply until 31 March 2022, unless otherwise stated in the direction or it is varied or revoked before then.\n\n## Supervision in the US\n\nAs a result of the onshoring of EU legislation in the UK and the exercise of the TTPs, UK firms in the Group are currently subject to substantially the same rules and regulations as before Brexit. The UK intends to recast onshored EU legislation into PRA and FCA rules and to complete UK implementation of the remaining Basel III reforms. The regulatory regimes for EU and UK financial services may change further, and temporary permissions and equivalence decisions may expire, and not be replaced, which would result in further adjustments to the UK regulatory landscape.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and its New York branch, and Barclays Bank PLC's US subsidiaries are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework involving numerous statutes, rules and regulations in the US. For example, the Group's US activities and operations are subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), as well as additional supervision, requirements and restrictions imposed by other federal and state regulators and self-regulatory organisations (SROs). In some cases, US requirements may impose restrictions on the Group's global activities, in addition to its activities in the US.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays US Holdings Limited (BUSHL), Barclays US LLC (BUSL), and Barclays Group US Inc. (BGUS) are regulated as bank holding companies (BHCs) by the FRB. BUSL is the Group's top-tier US holding company that holds substantially all of the Group's US subsidiaries (including Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware). BUSL is subject to requirements in respect of capital adequacy, capital planning and stress testing, risk management and governance, liquidity, leverage limits, large exposure limits, activities restrictions and financial regulatory reporting. Barclays Bank PLC's New York branch is also subject to enhanced prudential standards relating to, among other things, liquidity and risk management.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Supervision and regulation continued\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BUSHL and BUSL have elected to be treated as financial holding companies (FHCs) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. FHC status allows these entities to engage in a variety of financial and related activities, directly or through subsidiaries, including underwriting, dealing and market making in securities. Failure to maintain FHC status could result in increasingly stringent penalties and, ultimately, in the closure or cessation of certain operations in the US.\n\nThe Group's US securities broker/dealer and investment banking operations, are conducted primarily through Barclays Capital Inc., and are also subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and other government agencies and SROs under US federal and state securities laws.\n\nIn addition to oversight by the FRB, Barclays Bank PLC's New York branch and many of the Group's subsidiaries are regulated by additional authorities based on the location or activities of those entities. The New York branch of Barclays Bank PLC is subject to supervision and regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). Barclays Bank Delaware, a Delaware chartered bank, is subject to supervision and regulation by the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The deposits of Barclays Bank Delaware are insured by the FDIC. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BUSHL, BUSL, and BGUS are required to act as a source of strength for Barclays Bank Delaware. This could, among other things, require these entities to inject capital into Barclays Bank Delaware if it fails to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements.\n\nThe Group's US futures, options and swapsrelated activities, including client clearing operations are subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the National Futures Association and other SROs. Barclays Bank PLC is also a US registered swap dealer and is subject to the FRB swaps rules with respect to margin and capital requirements.\n\n## Supervision in Asia Pacific\n\n## Prudential regulation\n\nThe Group's operations in Asia Pacific are supervised and regulated by a broad range of national banking and financial services regulators.\n\nCertain Basel III standards were implemented in EU law through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV), as amended by CRR II and CRD V. Under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement of 24 January 2020, the Group remained subject to the EU regulatory framework until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. Beyond the minimum standards required by CRR, the PRA has expected the Group, in common with other major UK banks and building societies, to meet a 7% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at the level of the consolidated group since 1 January 2016.\n\nThe Group is also subject to a 'combined buffer requirement' consisting of (i) a capital conservation buffer, and (ii) a countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The CCyB is based on rates determined by the regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which the Group maintains exposures. In March 2020, the FPC cut the UK CCyB rate to 0% with immediate effect in order to support the supply of credit expected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs), such as the Group, are subject to a number of additional prudential requirements, including the requirement to hold additional loss-absorbing capacity and additional capital buffers above the level required by Basel III standards. The level of the G-SIB buffer is set by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) according to a bank's systemic importance and can range from 1% to 3.5% of risk weighted assets (RWAs). The G-SIB buffer must be met with CET1. In November 2020, the FSB published an update to its list of G-SIBs, maintaining the 1.5% G-SIB buffer that applies to the Group.\n\nThe PRA requires UK firms to hold additional capital to cover risks which the PRA assesses are not fully captured by the Pillar 1 capital requirement. The PRA sets this additional capital requirement (Pillar 2A) at least annually, derived from each firm's individual capital guidance. Under current PRA rules, the Pillar 2A must be met with at least 56% CET1 capital and no more than 25% Tier 2 capital. In addition, the capital that firms use to meet their minimum requirements (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A) cannot be counted towards meeting the combined buffer requirement.\n\nThe PRA may also impose a 'PRA buffer' to cover risks over a forward-looking planning horizon, including with regard to firm-specific stresses or management and governance weaknesses. If the PRA buffer is imposed on a specific firm, it must be met separately to the combined buffer requirement, and must be met fully with CET1 capital.\n\nAs part of its approach to ring fencing, the FPC established a framework to apply a firm-specific systemic risk buffer (SRB) which could be set between 0% and 3% of RWAs and which must be met solely with CET1 capital. The purpose of the SRB was to increase the capacity of ring-fenced bodies, such as Barclays Bank UK PLC, to absorb stress. The buffer rate applicable to the Group's ring-fenced sub-group was set at 1% with effect from August 2019. In response to the economic shock from COVID-19, the PRA and FPC held firms' SRB rates at their existing levels until December 2021. With the implementation of CRD V, the Other Systemically Important Institutions Buffer (O-SII buffer) replaced the SRB. As part of the implementation of CRD V, the PRA and FPC confirmed that the Barclays Bank UK PLC O-SII buffer would be held at the historic SRB rate of 1% until reassessment in December 2021, with any future adjustment to the O-SII buffer applicable from January 2023.\n\nIn the US, in October 2019, the FRB and other US regulatory agencies released final rules to tailor the applicability of prudential requirements for large domestic US banking organisations, foreign banking organisations and their intermediate holding companies (IHCs), including BUSL. BUSL is a 'Category III' IHC. BUSL (and Barclays Bank Delaware) is therefore subject to reduced (calibrated at 85%) standardised liquidity requirements, including the liquidity coverage ratio, which has been implemented by the US regulatory agencies, and the NSFR, which will become effective on 1 July 2021.",

        "page_content": "In June 2018 and October 2019, the FRB finalised rules regarding single counterparty credit limits (SCCL). The SCCL apply to the largest US BHCs and foreign banks' (including the Group's) US operations. The SCCL creates two separate limits for foreign banks, the first on combined US operations (CUSO) and the second on the US IHC (BUSL). The SCCL for US BHCs, including BUSL, requires that exposure to an unaffiliated counterparty of BUSL not exceed 25% of BUSL's Tier 1 capital. With respect to the CUSO, the SCCL rule allows certification to the FRB that a foreign bank complies with comparable home country regulation.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nBarclays Bank PLC is not required to comply with the CUSO requirement until 1 July 2021.\n\nThe Group and certain of its members are subject to supervisory stress testing exercises in a number of jurisdictions, designed to assess the resilience of banks to adverse economic or financial developments and ensure that they have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for the risks associated with their business profile. Assessment by regulators is on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, the latter focusing on such elements as data provision, stress testing capability including model risk management and internal management processes and controls.\n\n## Stabilisation and resolution framework\n\n## Recovery and Resolution\n\nThe UK framework for recovery and resolution was established by the Banking Act 2009, as amended. The EU framework was established by the 2014 Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by BRRD II.\n\nIn order to enable the exercise of its stabilisation powers, the BoE may impose a temporary stay on the rights of creditors to terminate, accelerate or close out contracts, or override events of default or termination rights that might otherwise be invoked as a result of a resolution action and modify contractual arrangements in certain circumstances (including a variation of the terms of any securities). HM Treasury may also amend the law for the purpose of enabling it to use its powers under this regime effectively, potentially with retrospective effect.\n\nThe BoE, as the UK resolution authority, has the power to resolve a UK financial institution that is failing or likely to fail by exercising several stabilisation options, including transferring such institution's business or securities to a commercial purchaser or a 'bridge bank' owned by the BoE or transferring the institution into temporary public ownership. When exercising any of its stabilisation powers, the BoE must generally provide that shareholders bear first losses, followed by creditors in accordance with the priority of their claims in insolvency.\n\nIn addition, the BoE has the power to permanently write-down, or convert into equity, Tier 1 capital instruments, Tier 2 capital instruments and eligible liabilities at the point of non-viability of the bank.\n\nThe PRA has made rules that require authorised firms to draw up recovery plans and resolution packs, as required by the BRRD. Recovery plans are designed to outline credible actions that authorised firms could implement in the event of severe stress in order to restore their business to a stable and sustainable condition. Removal of potential impediments to an orderly resolution of a banking group or one or more of its subsidiaries is considered as part of the BoE's and PRA's supervisory strategy for each firm, and the PRA can require firms to make significant changes in order to enhance resolvability. The Group currently provides the PRA with a recovery plan annually and with a resolution pack as requested.\n\nThe BoE's preferred approach for the resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC. Under such a strategy, Barclays PLC's subsidiaries would remain operational while Barclays PLC's capital instruments and eligible liabilities would be written down or converted to equity in order to recapitalise the Group and allow for the continued provision of services and operations throughout the resolution. The order in which the bail-in tool is applied reflects the hierarchy of capital instruments under CRD IV and otherwise respecting the hierarchy of claims in an ordinary insolvency. Accordingly, the more subordinated the claim, the more likely losses will be suffered by owners of the claim.\n\nIn July 2019, the BoE and PRA published final policies on the Resolvability Assessment Framework (RAF), designed to increase transparency and accountability and clarify the responsibilities on firms with respect to resolution. Firms are required to develop capabilities by 1 January 2022 covering three resolvability outcomes: (i) adequate financial resources; (ii) being able to continue to do business through resolution and restructuring; and (iii) being able to communicate and co-ordinate within the firm and with authorities. The first self-assessment report on these capabilities is expected to be submitted to the PRA/BoE by October 2021 with public disclosures by both firms and the PRA/BoE in June 2022 (and every two years thereafter).\n\nWhile regulators in many jurisdictions have indicated a preference for single point of entry resolution for the Group, additional resolution or bankruptcy provisions may apply to certain Group entities or branches.\n\nIn the US, BUSL is subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority established by Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), a regime for the orderly liquidation of systemically important financial institutions by the FDIC, as an alternative to proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the licensing authorities of Barclays Bank PLC New York branch and of Barclays Bank Delaware have the authority to take possession of the business and property of the applicable branch or entity they license and/or to revoke or suspend such licence.\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC, as a significant institution under the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), is subject to the powers of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) as the Eurozone resolution authority. The CBI and the ECB require Barclays Bank Ireland PLC to submit a standalone BRRD-compliant recovery plan on an annual basis. The SRB has the power to require data submissions specific to Barclays Bank Ireland PLC under powers conferred upon it by the BRRD and the SRMR. The SRB will exercise these powers to determine the optimal resolution strategy for Barclays Bank Ireland PLC in the context of the BoE's preferred resolution strategy of single point of entry with bail-in at Barclays PLC. The SRB also has the power under the BRRD and the SRMR to develop a resolution plan for Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.\n\nIn the US, Title I of the DFA, as amended, and the implementing regulations issued by the FRB and the FDIC require each bank holding company with assets of $250bn or more, including those within the Group, to prepare and submit a plan for the orderly resolution of subsidiaries and operations in the event of future material financial distress or failure. The Group's next submission of the US Resolution Plan in respect of its US operations will be a 'targeted plan' due on 17 December 2021.\n\n## TLAC and MREL\n\nThe MREL requirements will be fully implemented by 1 January 2022, at which time G-SIBs with resolution entities incorporated in the UK will be required to meet an MREL equivalent to the higher of: (i) two times the sum of their Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements; or (ii) the higher of two times their leverage ratio or 6.75% of leverage exposures. Internal MREL for operating subsidiaries is subject to a scalar in the 75-90% range of the external requirement that would apply to the subsidiary if it were a resolution entity. The starting point for the scalar is 90% for ring-fenced bank sub-groups.\n\nThe Group is subject to a Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), which includes a component reflecting the FSB's standards on total loss absorbency capacity (TLAC).",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Supervision and regulation continued\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC is subject to the SRB's MREL policy, as issued in May 2020, in respect of the internal MREL that it will be required to issue to the Group. The SRB's current calibration of internal MREL for non-resolution entities is expressed as two ratios that have to be met in parallel: (a) two times the sum of: (i) the firm's Pillar 1 requirement; (ii) its Pillar 2 requirement; and (b) two times the leverage ratio. The SRB's policy does not envisage the application of any scalar in respect of the internal MREL requirement.\n\n## Bank Levy and FSCS\n\nIn the US, the FRB's TLAC rule includes provisions that require BUSL to have: (i) a specified outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt; (ii) a specified outstanding amount of TLAC (consisting of common and preferred equity regulatory capital plus eligible long-term debt); and (iii) a specified common equity buffer. In addition, the FRB's TLAC rule prohibits BUSL, for so long as the Group's overall resolution plan treats BUSL as a non-resolution entity, from issuing TLAC to entities other than those within the Group.\n\nThe BRRD established a requirement for EU member states to set up a pre-funded resolution financing arrangement with funding equal to 1% of covered deposits by 31 December 2024 to cover the costs of bank resolutions. The UK has implemented this requirement by way of a tax on the balance sheets of banks known as the 'Bank Levy'.\n\n## Structural reform\n\nIn addition, the UK has a statutory compensation fund called the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which is funded by way of annual levies on most authorised financial services firms.\n\nIn the UK, the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 put in place a framework for ring-fencing certain operations of large banks. Ring-fencing requires, among other things, the separation of the retail and smaller deposit-taking business activities of UK banks into a legally distinct, operationally separate and economically independent entity, which is not permitted to undertake a range of activities.\n\nUS regulation places further substantive limits on the activities that may be conducted by banks and holding companies, including foreign banking organisations such as the Group. The 'Volcker Rule', which was part of the DFA and which came into effect in the US in 2015, prohibits banking entities from undertaking certain proprietary trading activities and limits such entities' ability to sponsor or invest in certain private equity funds and hedge funds (in each case broadly defined). As required by the rule, the Group has developed and implemented an extensive compliance and monitoring programme addressing proprietary trading and covered fund activities (both inside and outside of the US).\n\nIn recent years, regulators as well as globalstandard setting bodies such as the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have focused on improving transparency and reducing risk in markets, particularly risks related to over the counter (OTC) transactions. This focus has resulted in a variety of new regulations across the G20 countries and beyond that require or encourage on-venue trading, clearing, posting of margin and disclosure of pre-trade and post-trade information.\n\n## Market infrastructure regulation\n\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) has introduced requirements designed to improve transparency and reduce the risks associated with the derivatives market. EMIR has potential operational and financial impacts on the Group, including by imposing new collateral requirements. Over the coming months alterations to the existing derivative margin rules are expected to be finalised.\n\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (collectively referred to as MiFID II) have affected many of the markets in which the Group operates, the instruments in which it trades and the way it transacts with market counterparties and other customers. MiFID II is currently undergoing a review process, including as part of the EU's ongoing focus on the development of a stronger Capital Markets Union.\n\nThe EU Regulation on Sustainability-Related Disclosures introduces disclosure obligations requiring financial institutions to explain how they integrate environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decisions for certain financial products. In addition, the EU Taxonomy Regulation provides for a general framework for the development of an EU-wide classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. Finally, the UK and EU regulators are consulting on, amongst other things, proposals for regulatory measures to enhance climate and environmental disclosures and climate risk assessments, which will have an impact on the Group's existing practices in these areas.\n\nUS regulators have imposed similar rules as the EU with respect to the mandatory on-venue trading and clearing of certain derivatives, and post-trade transparency, as well as in relation to the margining of OTC derivatives. US regulators have finalised certain aspects of their rules with respect to their application on a cross-border basis, including with respect to their registration requirements in relation to non-US swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. The regulators may adopt further rules, or provide further guidance, regarding cross-border applicability. In December 2017, the CFTC and the European Commission recognised the trading venues of each other's jurisdiction to allow market participants to comply with mandatory on-venue trading requirements while trading on certain venues recognised by the other jurisdiction. In November 2020, the CFTC extended temporary relief that would permit trading venues and market participants located in the UK to continue to rely on this mutual recognition framework following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.\n\nThe EU Benchmarks Regulation applies to the administration, contribution and use of benchmarks within the EU. Financial institutions within the EU are prohibited from using benchmarks unless their administrators are authorised, registered or otherwise recognised in the EU, subject to transitional provisions expiring on 1 January 2022 (or 31 December 2022 under the UK onshored Benchmarks Regulation). Amendments to extend these provisions are underway for both the EU and UK Benchmarks Regulations. The FCA has stated that it does not intend to support LIBOR after the end of 2021. International initiatives in conjunction with global regulators are therefore underway to develop alternative benchmarks and risk-free rate fallback arrangements, including updates to existing, as well as new, applicable legislation.",

        "page_content": "Certain participants in US swap markets are required to register with the CFTC as 'swap dealers' or 'major swap participants' and/or, beginning in November 2021, with the SEC as 'security-based swap dealers' or 'major security-based swap participants'. Such registrants are subject to CFTC, and will be subject to SEC, regulation and oversight. Entities required to register as swap dealers are subject to business conduct, record-keeping and reporting requirements under CFTC rules. Barclays Bank PLC is subject to regulation by the FRB, and has provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer.\n\nAccordingly, Barclays Bank PLC is subject to CFTC rules on business conduct, recordkeeping and reporting and to FRB rules on capital and margin. The CFTC has approved certain comparability determinations that permit substituted compliance with non-US regulatory regimes for certain swap regulations. Substituted compliance is permitted for certain transaction-level requirements, where applicable, only with respect to transactions between a non-US swap dealer and a non-US counterparty, whereas entity-level determinations generally apply on an entitywide basis regardless of counterparty status. In November 2020, the CFTC extended temporary relief that would permit swap dealers located in the UK to continue to rely on existing CFTC substituted compliance determinations with respect to EU requirements in the event of a withdrawal of the UK from the EU. In addition, the CFTC has issued guidance that would require a non-US swap dealer to comply with certain CFTC rules in connection with transactions that are 'arranged, negotiated or executed' from the US. The CFTC has provided temporary no-action relief from application of the guidance. In July 2020 the CFTC adopted rules that, for certain CFTC requirements, codify on a permanent basis, the temporary no-action relief for transactions that are arranged, negotiated or executed in the US. The final rules also codify certain aspects of the CFTC's current cross-border framework with respect to internal and external business conduct requirements, and it is expected that the CFTC will introduce additional rules addressing the application of the cross-border framework to mandatory clearing, trading and reporting requirements. In October 2017, the CFTC issued an order permitting substituted compliance with EU margin rules for certain uncleared derivatives. However, as the Group is subject to the margin rules of the FRB, it will not benefit from the CFTC's action unless the FRB takes a similar approach.\n\nThe SEC has finalised the rules governing security based swap dealer registration in 2015, and registration of security-based swap dealers, as well as compliance with applicable security based swap dealer requirements, is expected to begin in November 2021.\n\n## Other regulation Culture\n\nIt is anticipated that Barclays Bank PLC and/or one or more of its affiliates will be required to register as a security-based swap dealer and will be required to comply with the SEC's rules for security-based swap dealers. These rules may impose costs and other requirements or restrictions that could impact our business. As with similar CFTC rules, it is expected that substituted compliance will be available for certain security-based swap dealer requirements; however, the SEC is currently considering applications for substituted compliance but has only issued a final comparability determination for Germany, and the ultimate scope and applicability of other determinations, including in respect of the UK, remains unclear.\n\nOur regulators have enhanced their focus on the promotion of cultural values as a key area for banks, although they generally view the responsibility for reforming culture as primarily sitting with the industry.\n\nMost countries where the Group operates have comprehensive laws requiring openness and transparency about the collection and use of personal information, and protection against loss and unauthorised or improper access. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) created a broadly harmonised privacy regime across EU member states, introducing mandatory breach notification, enhanced individual rights, a need to openly demonstrate compliance, and significant penalties for breaches. The extraterritorial effect of the GDPR means entities established outside the EU may fall within the Regulation's ambit when offering goods or services to European based customers or clients. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the UK continues to apply the GDPR framework (as onshored into UK law and hence now referred to as the 'UK GDPR' - this sits alongside an amended version of the UK Data Protection Act 2018). Two years after its introduction the GDPR has become the global touchstone as countries around the world either usher in or contemplate similar data privacy laws, or align their existing legislation. During 2020 new privacy laws have been passed in Switzerland, took effect in Brazil and Dubai, and were proposed in India and China.\n\n## Data protection and PSD2\n\nIn the US, Barclays US Consumer Bank is subject to the US Federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which came into effect on 1 January 2020 (CCPA). The GLBA limits the use and disclosure of non-public personal information to non-affiliated third parties and requires financial institutions to provide written notice of their privacy policies and practices. Any violations of the GLBA could subject the US Consumer Bank to additional reporting requirements or regulatory investigation or audits by the financial regulators. The CCPA only applies to personal information that is not collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA, and it requires the US Consumer Bank to provide California consumers with additional disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of personal information, and grants California consumers access, deletion, and other rights with respect to their personal information. The CCPA subjects the US Consumer Bank to enforcement penalties by the Attorney General of the State of California, and grants a private right of action with respect to certain data breaches.\n\n## Cyber security and operational resilience\n\nFrom 14 September 2019, new rules apply under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) that affect the way banks and other payment services providers check that the person requesting access to an account or trying to make a payment is permitted to do so. This is referred to as strong customer authentication (SCA). In April 2020, the FCA provided an additional six months (to 14 September 2021) for the industry to implement SCA for e-commerce.\n\nRegulators in the UK, the EU and the US continue to focus on cyber security risk management, organisational operational resilience and overall soundness across all financial services firms, with customer and market expectations of continuous access to financial services at an all-time high.\n\nThis is evidenced by the publication of a number of proposed laws and changes to regulatory frameworks. For example, the UK regulators published for consultation a new framework for operational resilience that focuses on the identification of important business services, setting impact tolerances for them, and then testing against them. The European Commission has proposed legislation on cyber security and operational resilience for the financial services sector, including oversight of third party service providers. The regulatory focus has been further heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The existing and anticipated requirements for increased controls will serve to improve industry standardisation and resilience capabilities, enhancing our ability to deliver services during periods of potential disruption. However, such measures are likely to result in increased technology and compliance costs for the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Supervision and regulation continued\n\n## Sanctions and financial crime\n\nIn May 2018, the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act became law in the UK. The Act allows for the adoption of an autonomous UK sanctions regime, as well as a more flexible licensing regime post-Brexit. On 6 July 2020, the UK Government announced the first sanctions that have been implemented independently by the UK outside the auspices of the UN and EU. The autonomous UK sanctions regime came into force on 1 January 2021. Those sanctions apply within the UK and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world; they also apply to overseas branches of UK companies.\n\nThe UK Bribery Act 2010 introduced a new form of corporate criminal liability focused broadly on a company's failure to prevent bribery on its behalf. The Criminal Finances Act 2017 introduced new corporate criminal offences of failing to prevent the facilitation of UK and overseas tax evasion. Both pieces of legislation have broad application and in certain circumstances may have extraterritorial impact on entities, persons or activities located outside the UK, including Barclays PLC's subsidiaries outside the UK. The UK Bribery Act requires the Group to have adequate procedures to prevent bribery which, due to the extraterritorial nature of the Act, makes this both complex and costly. Additionally, the Criminal Finances Act requires the Group to have reasonable prevention procedures in place to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by persons acting for, or on behalf of, the Group.\n\nIn the US, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act 2001, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 and regulations thereunder contain numerous anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements for financial institutions. In addition, the Group is subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits, among other things, corrupt payments to foreign government officials. It is also subject to various economic sanctions laws, regulations and executive orders administered by the US government, which prohibit or restrict some or all business activities and other dealings with or involving certain individuals, entities, groups, countries and territories.\n\nIn some cases, US state and federal regulations addressing sanctions, money laundering and other financial crimes may impact entities, persons or activities located or undertaken outside the US, including Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries. US government authorities have aggressively enforced these laws against financial institutions in recent years. Failure of a financial institution to ensure compliance with such laws could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the institution.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\nIn assessing the financial performance of the Group, management uses a range of KPIs which focus on the Group's financial strength, the delivery of sustainable returns and cost management. Barclays continues to target greater than 10% RoTE over time. However, given the COVID-19 pandemic, a meaningful improvement in returns versus 2019 was not possible due to the challenging operating environment. Cost discipline remains a priority and management continues to target a cost: income ratio below 60% over time.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhy is it important and how the Group performed\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio\n\nCET1 ratio is a measure of capital that is predominantly common equity defined by the CRR, as amended by CRR II.\n\nCapital requirements are part of the regulatory framework governing how banks and depository institutions are supervised. Capital ratios express a bank's capital as a percentage of its RWAs as defined by the PRA.\n\nThe Group's capital management objective is to maximise shareholder value by prudently managing the level and mix of its capital to: ensure the Group and all of its subsidiaries are appropriately capitalised relative to their regulatory minimum and stressed capital requirements, support the Group's risk appetite, growth and strategic options, while seeking to maintain a robust credit proposition for the Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nGroup target: a CET1 ratio in the range of 13-14%.\n\nThe CET1 ratio increased to 15.1% (2019: 13.8%), reflecting headroom of 3.9% above the MDA hurdle of 11.2%. CET1 capital increased by \u00a35.5bn to \u00a346.3bn reflecting resilient capital generation through \u00a37.9bn of profit before tax, excluding credit impairment charges of \u00a34.8bn and a \u00a31.0bn increase due to the cancellation of the full year 2019 dividend. These increases were partially offset by \u00a30.9bn of AT1 coupons paid and the announced 1.0p full year 2020 dividend. The CET1 capital increase also reflects regulatory measures for IFRS 9 transitional relief, prudent valuation and qualifying software assets. RWAs increased by \u00a311.1bn to \u00a3306.2bn primarily due to higher market volatility, increased client activity and a reduction in credit quality within CIB, partially offset by lower consumer lending.\n\n## Non-IFRS performance measures\n\nThe Group's management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses' performance between financial periods, and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group.\n\nThey also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by management. However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well. Refer to the non-IFRS performance measures section for further information and calculations of non-IFRS performance measures included throughout this section and the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\nCET1 ratio 15.1 % 2019: 13.8%\n\n2018: 13.2%",

The Group cost: income ratio, including litigation and  conduct, reduced to 64% (2019: 71%) due to favourable  income and the prior year including a PPI provision  of \u00a31.4bn. This measure indicates the return generated by the  management of the business based on shareholders'  tangible equity. Achieving a target RoTE demonstrates  the organisation's ability to execute its strategy and align  management's interests with the shareholders'.

Excluding litigation and conduct, profit before tax was \u00a33,218m (2019: \u00a36,206m).\n\nStatutory RoTE was 3.2% (2019: 5.3%) and statutory EPS was 8.8p (2019: 14.3p).\n\nPre-provision profits a were broadly stable at \u00a38,056m despite the pandemic, benefiting from the Group's diversified business model, which included a strong performance in CIB offset by headwinds in Barclays UK and CC&P.\n\nCredit impairment charges increased to \u00a34,838m (2019: \u00a31,912m) due to the deterioration in economic outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current year charge is broadly driven by \u00a32,323m of non-default provision for expected future customer and client stress and \u00a3800m of single name wholesale loan charges. The expected credit loss (ECL) provision remains highly uncertain as the economic impact of the global pandemic continues to evolve.\n\nTotal income increased to \u00a321,766m (2019: \u00a321,632m). Barclays UK income decreased 14%. Barclays International income increased 8%, with CIB income up 22% and CC&P income down 22%.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% to \u00a313,733m, including structural cost actions and additional COVID-19 related costs, resulting in a cost: income ratio, excluding litigation and conduct, of 63% (2019: 63%). Excluding structural cost actions of \u00a3368m (2019: \u00a3150m) and \u00a395m spend to date of Barclays' COVID-19 Community Aid Package, operating expenses would have been \u00a313,270m (2019: \u00a313,435m), reflecting disciplined cost management and efficiencies, resulting in a cost: income ratio of 61% (2019: 62%).\n\nAttributable profit was \u00a31,526m (2019: \u00a32,461m). Excluding litigation and conduct, attributable profit was \u00a31,638m (2019: \u00a34,194m), generating a RoTE of 3.4% (2019: 9.0%) and EPS of 9.5p (2019: 24.4p).",

Cash collateral and settlement balances increased by \u00a318bn to \u00a3101bn, predominantly due to increased activity.\n\nTrading portfolio assets increased \u00a314bn to \u00a3128bn due to increased client activity and financial assets at fair value through the income statement increased \u00a342bn to \u00a3175bn due to reverse repurchase agreements and similar secured lending.\n\nLoans and advances at amortised cost increased \u00a34bn to \u00a3343bn, which reflected \u00a312bn of lending under the government-backed loan schemes and \u00a35bn of mortgage growth, partially offset by lower unsecured lending balances.\n\n## Total liabilities\n\nDeposits at amortised cost increased \u00a365bn to \u00a3481bn primarily due to CIB clients increasing liquidity, and lower consumer spending levels.\n\nTotal liabilities increased \u00a3208bn to \u00a31,283bn.\n\nDerivative financial instruments liabilities increased \u00a372bn to \u00a3301bn, driven by a decrease in major interest rate curves and increased client activity. This is consistent with the movement in derivative financial instrument assets. Cash collateral and settlement balances increased by \u00a318bn to \u00a385bn predominantly due to increased activity.\n\nTrading portfolio liabilities increased \u00a310bn due to increased client activity to \u00a347bn and financial liabilities designated at fair value increased by \u00a345bn due to repurchase agreements and similar secured borrowing.\n\n## Total shareholders' equity\n\nOther equity instruments increased \u00a30.3bn to \u00a311.2bn due to the issuance of a $1.5bn AT1 instrument, partially offset by a redemption of a \u20ac1.0bn AT1 instrument. AT1 securities are perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities structured to qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at the relevant issue date.\n\nTotal shareholders' equity increased \u00a31.4bn to \u00a365.8bn.\n\nThe cash flow hedging reserve increased \u00a30.6bn to \u00a31.6bn as a result of fair value movements on interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes due to a decrease in major interest rate curves.\n\nThe own credit reserve decreased \u00a30.6bn to \u00a31.0bn debit, principally reflecting Barclays' lower cost of funding.\n\nThe currency translation reserve decreased \u00a30.4bn to \u00a32.9bn due to strengthening of GBP against USD of 4%, when comparing year-end closing rates.\n\nRetained earnings increased \u00a31.3bn to \u00a345.5bn, mainly due to profits of \u00a31.5bn.\n\nTangible net asset value per share increased 7p to 269p as 9p earnings per share were offset by net negative reserve movements of 2p.",

Net interest income reduced 11% to \u00a35,234m with a net interest margin of 2.61% (2019: 3.09%). Net fee, commission and other income decreased 24% to \u00a31,113m.\n\nProfit before tax, excluding litigation and conduct, decreased 78% to \u00a3578m. RoTE was 3.4% (2019: 17.5%) reflecting a challenging operating environment and materially higher credit impairment charges.\n\nPersonal Banking income decreased 12% to \u00a33,522m, reflecting deposit margin compression from lower interest rates, lower unsecured lending balances, and COVID-19 customer support actions, partially offset by balance growth in deposits and mortgages, as well as the transfer of Barclays Partner Finance (BPF) from Barclays International in Q220.\n\nBarclaycard Consumer UK income decreased 24% to \u00a31,519m as reduced borrowing and spend levels by customers resulted in a lower level of interest earning lending (IEL) balances, as well as lower debt sales.\n\nBusiness Banking income decreased 3% to \u00a31,306m due to deposit margin compression from lower interest rates, lower transactional fee volumes as a result of COVID-19 and related customer support actions, partially offset by lending and deposit balance growth from continued support for SMEs through \u00a311.0bn of BBLS and CBILS loans.\n\nOperating expenses increased 7% to \u00a34,320m, reflecting investment spend including structural cost actions, higher servicing and financial assistance costs, and the transfer of BPF, partially offset by efficiency savings.\n\nLoans and advances to customers at amortised cost increased 6% to \u00a3205.4bn, predominantly from continued support for SMEs through \u00a311.0bn of BBLS and CBILS lending, \u00a35.1bn of mortgage growth following a strong flow of new applications as well as strong customer retention and the \u00a32.4bn transfer of BPF, partially offset by \u00a36.6bn lower unsecured lending balances.\n\nRWAs decreased to \u00a373.7bn (December 2019: \u00a374.9bn) driven by lower unsecured lending balances, partially offset by growth in mortgages and the transfer of BPF.\n\nCustomer deposits at amortised cost increased 17% to \u00a3240.5bn, reflecting an increase of \u00a320.5bn and \u00a314.4bn in Personal Banking and Business Banking respectively, further strengthening the liquidity position and contributing to a loan: deposit ratio of 89% (2019: 96%).\n\nCredit impairment charges increased to \u00a31,467m (2019: \u00a3712m) due to the deterioration in economic outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current year charge is broadly driven by \u00a3847m of non-default provision for expected future customer and client stress. As at 31 December 2020, 30- and 90-day arrears rates in UK cards were 1.7% (Q419: 1.7%) and 0.8% (Q419: 0.8%) respectively.",

FICC income increased 53% to \u00a35,138m driven by strong performances in macro and credit, mainly reflecting wider spreads. Equities income increased 31% to \u00a32,471m driven by derivatives and cash due to higher levels of client activity and volatility.\n\nWithin Corporate, Transaction banking income decreased 8% to \u00a31,546m as deposit balance growth was more than offset by margin compression. Corporate lending income decreased by 23% to \u00a3590m, reflecting c.\u00a3210m of losses on the mark to market of lending and related hedge positions, and the carry costs of those hedges.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b   Data source: Coalition Greenwich, Preliminary FY20 Competitor Analysis. Market share represents Barclays share of the Global Industry Revenue Pool. Analysis is based on Barclays internal business structure and internal revenues.\n\nCredit impairment charges increased to \u00a33,280m (2019: \u00a31,173m). CIB credit impairment charges increased to \u00a31,559m (2019: \u00a3157m) due to the deterioration in economic outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current year charge is broadly driven by \u00a3711m of non-default provision for future expected customer and client stress and c.\u00a3800m of single name wholesale loan charges. CC&P credit impairment charges increased to \u00a31,721m (2019: \u00a31,016m) due to the deterioration in economic outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current year charge is broadly driven by \u00a3752m of non-default provisions for future expected customer and client stress. As at 31 December 2020, 30 and 90-day arrears in US cards were 2.5% (Q419: 2.7%) and 1.4% (Q419: 1.4%) respectively.\n\nCC&P income decreased 22% to \u00a33,445m reflecting lower cards balances, margin compression and reduced payments activity, which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the transfer of BPF to Barclays UK in Q220. Q220 included a c.\u00a3100m valuation loss on Barclays' preference shares in Visa Inc. resulting from the impact of the Supreme Court ruling concerning charges paid by merchants.\n\nOperating expenses decreased 4% to \u00a39,005m.

From Q420 onwards, the full note coupon is presented as interest expense within net interest income. The financial guarantee element of the coupon, for these notes, had previously been recognised in net investment income. The reclassification of \u00a399m in 2020 has caused a reduction in the 2020 Barclays International and Total Barclays UK and Barclays International net interest margins of 0.11% and 0.03% respectively. Had the equivalent 2019 expenses been recognised in net interest income, the Barclays International and Total Barclays UK and Barclays International net interest margins would have been 4.04% and 3.41% respectively.\n- a Barclays International margins include IEL balances within the investment banking business.\n- c Other includes Head Office and non-lending related investment banking businesses not included in Barclays International margins.\n\nThe Group net interest margin decreased 48bps to 2.94%. Barclays UK net interest margin decreased 48bps to 2.61%, reflecting the impact of lower UK interest rates, COVID-19 customer support actions, as well as the mix impact of strong mortgage growth and lower unsecured lending balances. Barclays International net interest margin decreased 43bps to 3.64%, mainly reflecting lower cards balances.\n\nThe Group combined product and equity structural hedge notional as at 31 December 2020 was \u00a3188bn, with an average duration of 2.5 to 3 years. Group net interest income includes gross structural hedge contributions of \u00a31.7bn (2019: \u00a31.8bn) and net structural hedge contributions of \u00a31.2bn (2019: \u00a30.5bn). Gross structural hedge contributions represent the absolute level of interest earned from the fixed receipts on the basket of swaps in the structural hedge, while the net structural hedge contributions represent the net interest earned on the difference between the structural hedge rate and prevailing floating rates.",

Our opinion is unmodified\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the financial statements of Barclays PLC give a true and fair view of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 December 2020, and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n\n## In our opinion:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union ('IFRSs as adopted by the EU');\n\n## What our opinion covers\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation to the extent applicable.\n\nWe have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of Barclays PLC for the year ended 31 December 2020 (FY20) included in the Annual Report and Accounts, which comprise:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Consolidated income statement\n\n## Group (Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries)\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Consolidated statement of changes in equity\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Consolidated balance sheet\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Consolidated cash flow statement\n\n## Parent Company (Barclays PLC)\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Notes 1 to 43 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the summary of significant accounting policies\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Statement of comprehensive income\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Statement of changes in equity\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Balance sheet\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Cash flow statement\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Note 42 to the Financial Statements, including the summary of significant accounting policies\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reports to the Board Audit Committee.\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## 2. Overview of our audit\n\nFollowing our FY19 audit and considering the developments affecting the Barclays PLC Group since then, we have updated our risk assessment. Our assessment of the risks that are of most significance to our audit has changed since our FY19 audit.\n\n## Factors driving our view of risks\n\nIn 2020 the Group's performance has been affected by COVID-19 which has driven a significant increase in expected credit loss ('ECL') provisions compared to 2019 and impacted income due to COVID-19 customer support actions and changing customer behaviour. Income in the markets business has grown versus the prior year due to wider spreads and market share gains but the low interest rate environment has continued to impact interest margins in BBUK.\n\nWe have increased our focus on the post model adjustments used in the determination of the ECL provisions, increased the level of testing we perform over many of the ECL models and brought a greater number of ECL models into our audit scope.\n\nWe have considered the impact of COVID-19, (including the FRC guidance for auditors) in our risk assessment and have adjusted our audit procedures accordingly. This has included increased focus on future economic assumptions used by the Group in estimates such as the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles (for which we have identified a new Key Audit Matter) and ECL.\n\nWe have introduced a Key Audit Matter relating to the UK Pension scheme which considers both the assumptions used to value the liability and the valuation of certain of the level 3 assets of the scheme.\n\nWe have assessed whether COVID-19 has led to changes in financial reporting controls (either through the introduction of new controls or changes to the design and operating effectiveness of existing controls). Where this is the case, we have adapted our audit testing.\n\n| Key Audit Matters                                               | Item   |   Item |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Impairment allowance on  loans and advance at  amortised cost   | \u2192      |    4.1 |\n| Valuation of financial  instruments held at fair  value         | \u2194      |    4.2 |\n| Impairment of goodwill and  intangible assets                   | NEW    |    4.3 |\n| UK Pension scheme  valuation                                    | NEW    |    4.4 |\n| User access management                                          | \u2194      |    4.5 |\n| Recoverability of Parent  Company's investment in  subsidiaries | \u2192      |    4.6 |\n\nNEW\n\nNewly identified risk\n\nSimilar risk to FY19\n\n\u2194\n\nDecreased risk since FY19\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\nIncreased risk since FY19\n\n## Our use of specialists and innovation\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Credit risk modelling specialists for our testing of the ECL models.\n\nUsing the work of specialists: We used KPMG specialists to assist us in various aspects of our audit. This includes, for example::\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Economics specialists for our work related to the macro economic variables and scenarios used in the determination of the ECL provisions\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Corporate finance valuation specialists for our work over the methodology underpinning and certain of the assumptions used in the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangibles\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Valuation specialists for our independent repricing of samples of financial instruments\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Actuarial pensions specialists for our work on the valuation of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nA requirement of the auditing standards is that we undertake procedures which are deliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been predicted by Barclays' management.\n\n## Incorporating unpredictability into our audit:\n\nAs an example, we extended our testing of IFRS 9 models to include expanded testing on a number of lower risk models. We also increased the population of Level 3 financial instruments which we perform independent re-pricing over.",

In 2020 we have continued to deploy a large number of data and analytics tools across our audit. We used our Clara IT control analytics to perform some of our IT audit procedures over complete populations.\n\nDuring the year, the BAC met 10 times. KPMG are invited to attend all BAC meetings and are provided an opportunity to meet with the BAC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the BAC in section 4 and have highlighted those matters that required particular judgement.\n\n## Board audit Committee ('BAC') interaction\n\nIn addition, our audit team includes a senior partner who has specific responsibility for ensuring audit quality (our 'Audit Quality partner'). The Board Audit Committee met with the Audit Quality Partner, without the audit team present, to receive a report on his assessment of audit quality.\n\n## Our independence\n\nThe matters included in the BAC Chair's report on page 72 are consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2017. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the four financial years ended 31 December 2020.\n\nWe have not performed any non-audit services during FY20 or subsequently, which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nThe Group lead engagement partner rotates every five years. As these are the third set of Barclays PLC financial statements signed by Michelle Hinchliffe, she will be required to rotate after the FY22 audit.\n\nThe average tenure of key audit partners who are responsible for component audits as set out in section 7 below is three years, with the shortest being their second year of involvement and longest being four years.\n\n## Measures of independence\n\n| Total audit fee                              | \u00a347m             |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Other audit related fees                     | \u00a310m             |\n| Other services                               | \u00a32m              |\n| Date first appointed                         | 31 March 2017    |\n| Uninterrupted audit tenure                   | 4 years          |\n| Next financial period which require a tender | 31 December 2027 |\n| Tenure of Group lead engagement partner      | 3 years          |\n| Average tenure of key audit partners         | 3 years          |\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material misstatement.\n\n## (Item 6)\n\nWe have determined overall materiality for the Barclays PLC Group to be \u00a3230m (FY19: \u00a3250m). The reduction in materiality is due to the reduction in the Group's normalised profit before tax which is the benchmark upon which materiality is based.\n\nConsistent with FY19, we determined that normalised profit before tax from continuing operations remains the key benchmark for the Barclays PLC Group. For FY20 we have normalised this benchmark by \u00a32.1bn to adjust\n\nfor the impact of the post model adjustments made to the ECL allowance by the Group, to reflect COVID-19 related economic uncertainty, as disclosed on page 180. For FY19 we normalised this benchmark by \u00a31.4bn to exclude charges related to certain conduct matters.\n\nWe have determined overall materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a3225m (FY19: \u00a3245m). Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark of net assets of which it represents 0.4% (FY19: 0.4%).\n\nAs such, for FY20 we based our materiality on normalised profit before tax, of which it represents 4.4% (FY19: 4.3%).\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial\n\nmisstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Normalised profit before tax from continuing operations \u00a35,132m\n\n4\n\nA key judgment in determining materiality (and performance materiality) is the appropriate benchmark to select, based on our perception of the needs of shareholders. We considered which benchmarks and key performance indicators have the greatest bearing on shareholder decisions.\n\n(2019: \u00a35,757m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## A  \u00a3230m\n\n## B  \u00a3170m\n\nWhole financial statements materiality (2019: \u00a3250m)\n\nBiggest component materiality Range of materiality for the three components (\u00a375m-\u00a3170m) (2019: \u00a3100m to \u00a3135m)\n\nMisstatements reported to the Board Audit Committee (2018: \u00a312m)\n\n## C  \u00a311m",

The outputs from these hubs are included in the financial information of the reporting components and so the India operations are not considered to be a separate component.\n\nDue to the travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19 the Group audit team did not visit the overseas components. A virtual communication and oversight strategy was implemented between the Group audit team and the components and certain other participating locations. Further details are set out in section 7.\n\nWe have performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, set out in more detail in Section 7. In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as agreed with the Board Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Coverage of Group financial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group total assets 94%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2019: 93%)\n\n## The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nThe Group has set out its commitments under the Paris Accord to be a net zero bank by 2050. Further information is provided in the Group's Environment, Social and Governance report, the link to which is on page 41.\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements.\n\nClimate change risk could have a significant impact on the Group's business as the operations and strategy of the Group are adapted to address the potential financial risks which could arise from both the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. Climate change initiatives and commitments impact the Group in a variety of ways including credit risk and market risk and greater narrative and disclosure of the impact of climate change risk is also incorporated into the annual report.\n\nWe have assessed how the Group considers the impact of climate change risk on the credit rating of certain counterparties and the valuation of loan collateral. We have also incorporated a consideration of the climate change impact on the valuation of certain hard to price financial instruments in elevated risk sectors.\n\nAs a part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group's financial statements and the Group's preparedness for this. We have performed a risk assessment of how the impact of commitments made by Barclays in respect of climate change (including those considered during the 2020 AGM) may affect the financial statements and our audit. There was no impact of this on our key audit matters.\n\nWe have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of the climate risk disclosures set out on pages 39 - 41 in the Annual Report. We have been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of certain disclosures in the separate Environment, Social and Governance report which is referred to on page 41 of the Annual Report.",

Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Parent Company or the Group or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Parent Company's and the Group's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company, the financial services industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to the business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Parent Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that management considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Parent Company's available financial resources, and we challenged on over this period were:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the impact on regulatory capital requirements in the event of an economic slowdown or recession.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the availability of funding and liquidity in the event of a market wide stress scenario including the impact in which the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold and the manner in which the UK continues its withdrawal from the European Union; and\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the availability of financial resources in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nOur procedures also included an assessment of whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a complete and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.\n\nAccordingly, we found the use of the going concern basis of preparation without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Group's and Parent Company's financial statements is appropriate\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 102 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in Note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nBased on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit, we have nothing further to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Directors' confirmation within the viability statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n\nUnder the Listing Rules we are also required to review the Viability Statement. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Directors' explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgments that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's longer-term viability. For example, the longer-term impact of COVID-19 on the markets in which the Group operates, its customers and the wider economy is unclear.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.\n\n## Our reporting\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 We have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

Key audit matters\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n## What we mean\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the overall audit strategy;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the allocation of resources in the audit;\n\nWe include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe continue to perform procedures over the provision for conduct redress costs (PPI) and the provisions for legal, competition and regulatory related matters. However, following the resolution of certain matters, and developments in those still open, the level of judgement and estimation uncertainty relating to these matters has reduced since the previous year, we have not assessed either of these as being one of the most significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.\n\n## 4.1 Impairment allowances on loans and advances at amortised cost, including off-balance sheet elements\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\n| Financial statement elements                                                                          | FY20   | FY19   | Our assessment of risk vs FY19                                                                                                                                               | Our results                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Impairment allowances on loans and advances  at amortised cost, including off-balance sheet  elements | \u00a39.4bn | \u00a36.6bn | \u2192 Our assessment is the risk increased since FY19.  This is due to the increased uncertainty around credit  risk and global economic environments brought about  by COVID-19 | FY20:  Acceptable FY19: Acceptable |\n\n## Subjective estimate\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Model estimations - Inherently judgemental modelling is used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probabilities of Default ('PD'), Probabilities of Survival ('PS'), Loss Given Default ('LGD'), and Exposures at Default ('EAD'). The PD and revolving PS models are the key drivers of complexity in the ECL and also impact the staging of assets and as a result are considered the most significant judgemental aspect of the Group's ECL modelling approach.\n\nThe estimation of expected credit losses ('ECL') on financial instruments, involves significant judgement and estimates.  The key areas where we identified greater levels of management judgement and therefore increased levels of audit focus in the Group's estimation of ECLs are:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Economic scenarios - IFRS 9 requires the Group to measure ECLs on an unbiased forwardlooking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Significant management judgement is applied in determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them especially when considering the current uncertain economic environment as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nKey aspects of our controls testing involved the following:\n\nControls testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the ECL processes. We tested the relevant manual, general IT and application controls over key systems used in the ECL process.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls over the completeness and accuracy of the key inputs, data and assumptions into the IFRS 9 impairment models;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Evaluating controls over validation, implementation and model monitoring;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls over the application of the staging criteria;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Evaluating controls over authorisation and calculation of post model adjustments and management overlays; and\n\nOur financial risk modelling expertise: We involved our own financial risk modelling specialists in the following:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Testing key controls relating to selection and implementation of material macro-economic variables and the controls over the scenario selection and probabilities.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Evaluating the appropriateness of the Group's IFRS 9 impairment methodologies (including the staging criteria used);\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Reperforming and inspecting model code for the calculation of certain components of the ECL model (including the staging criteria);",

        "page_content": "## Description of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Qualitative adjustments - Adjustments to the model-driven ECL results are raised by management to address known impairment model limitations or emerging trends as well as risks not captured by models. They represent approximately 14.8% net of the ECL. These adjustments are inherently uncertain and significant management judgement is involved in estimating these amounts especially in relation to economic uncertainty as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the impairment of loans and advances to customers including off balance sheet elements has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The credit risk sections of the financial statements (pages 181-189) disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\nThe disclosures regarding the Group's application of IFRS 9 are key to explaining the key judgements and material inputs to the IFRS 9 ECL results.\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our approach to the audit of the ECL provisions including details of the way we responded through our audit to the impact of COVID-19 on the ECL calculation. This included details of our controls and substantive procedures.\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Board Audit Committee:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our conclusions on the appropriateness of Barclays' ECL methodology, models, qualitative adjustments and macroeconomic assumptions (Including associated probability weightings) and related disclosures.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 For a sample of models which were changed or updated during the year, evaluating whether the changes (including the updated model code) were appropriate by assessing the updated model methodology;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 For a sample of material models, assessing the reasonableness of the model predictions by comparing them against actual results and evaluating the resulting differences.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 For a sample of models evaluating the model output by inspecting the corresponding model functionality and independently implementing the model by rebuilding the model code; and\n\nOur economic scenario expertise: We involved our own economic specialists to assist us in assessing:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The key economic variables which included agreeing samples of economic variables to external sources;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The appropriateness of the Group's methodology for determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings applied to them;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The overall reasonableness of the economic forecasts by comparing the Group's forecasts to our own modelled forecasts; and\n\nTest of details: Key aspects of our testing in addition to those set out above involved:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The reasonableness of the Group's considerations of the ECL impact of the current economic environment due to COVID-19.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Sample testing over key inputs, data and assumptions impacting ECL calculations to assess the reasonableness of economic forecasts, weights, and model assumptions applied; and\n\nAssessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosures appropriately disclose and address the uncertainty which exists when determining the ECL. As part of this, we assessed the sensitivity analysis that is disclosed. In addition, we assessed whether the disclosure of the key judgements and assumptions made was sufficiently clear.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Selecting a sample of post model adjustments, considering the size and complexity of management overlays with a focus on COVID-19 related overlays, in order to assess the reasonableness of the adjustments by challenging key assumptions, inspecting the calculation methodology and tracing a sample of the data used back to source data.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The appropriateness of the model estimations and adjustments recorded to the modelled driven ECL calculations to reflect the current uncertain economic environment as a result of COVID-19. This included the appropriateness of macroeconomic forecasts and selection of probability weights used in the ECL calculations.\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed we considered the ECL charge, provision recognised and the related disclosures to be acceptable (2019 result: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Board Audit Committee Report on page 72 for details on how the Board Audit Committee considered impairment as an area of focus, page 296 for the accounting policy on accounting for the impairment of financial assets under IFRS 9, page 167 for the credit risk disclosures, and page 296 for the financial disclosure note 7; Credit Impairment charges and other provisions.",

These financial instruments are classified as Level 3, with management having controls in place over the boundary between Level 2 and 3 positions. Our significant audit risk is therefore primarily over significant Level 3 portfolios.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's financial instruments is determined through the application of valuation techniques which can involve the exercise of significant judgement by the Group in relation to the choice of the valuation models, pricing inputs and post-model pricing adjustments, including fair value adjustments (FVAs) and credit and funding adjustments (together referred to as XVAs).\n\nIn addition, there may also be valuation complexity associated with Level 2 portfolios, specifically where valuation modelling techniques result in significant limitations or where there is greater uncertainty around the choice of an appropriate pricing methodology, and consequently more than one valuation methodology could be used for that product across the market.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the subjective estimates in fair value measurement of certain portfolios, as detailed above, have a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 17) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the Group.\n\nWe identified one derivatives portfolio that we considered to be harder to value Level 2 due to an element of modelling complexity associated with the product.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\nThe disclosures are key to explaining the valuation techniques, key judgements, assumptions and material inputs.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nControl testing: We performed end to end process walk-throughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the valuations processes We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating specifically to these portfolios. These included controls over:\n\nRisk assessment: We performed risk assessment procedures over the entirety of Level 1, 2 and Level 3 balances within the Group's financial statements (i.e. all of the fair value financial instruments held by the Group). As part of these risk assessment procedures we identified which portfolios have a risk of material misstatement including those arising from significant judgements over valuation either due to unobservable inputs or complex models, see left for more explanation.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Independent price verification (IPV), performed by a control function, of key market pricing inputs, including completeness of positions and valuation inputs subject to the IPV process;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The validation, completeness, implementation and usage of valuation models.

We also inspected movements in unobservable inputs throughout the period to challenge whether any gain or loss generated was appropriate.",

The CGU-specific goodwill and intangible assets are subsequently added to the CGU-specific tangible equity to arrive at the carrying value subject to the impairment test. The group applies judgement in allocating carrying values to specific CGUs for impairment testing purposes. In particular, the determination of an appropriate allocation rate is subjective and can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets may be misstated if the carrying values of these assets in the balance sheet are not supported by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the underlying businesses (the value in use). The preparation of the estimate of the carrying value and value in use ('VIU') involves subjective judgement and uncertainties.\n\nThe calculation of VIU is dependent on certain key assumptions around the future cash flows which have been forecasted using the Group's Medium Term Plan ('MTP'), adjustments from those MTP cash flows to reflect developments in macroeconomic conditions and business developments, the discount rates and the terminal growth rates. These assumptions, which are judgemental, are derived from a combination of management estimates, market data and other information obtained from external sources.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Personal banking\n\nOur work focused on CGUs which have low or significantly reduced headroom and a high sensitivity to the key assumptions including:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Business banking\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\n\nThe disclosures are key to explaining the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nMethodology assessment: We assessed (relative to the requirements of the accounting standard) the appropriateness of Group's impairment methodology, including the allocation of carrying values utilising the tangible equity of the individual CGU and the capital allocation rate.\n\nControl testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the process of estimating value in use and allocating carrying values to specific CGUs for impairment testing purposes. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating to the process. These included controls over application of the impairment methodology, preparation of the estimated future cash flows and review of the key assumptions in determining the value in use.\n\nSensitivity analysis: We performed breakeven analysis on the discount rate, terminal growth rate and the future cash flows to understand which CGUs were most sensitive to changes in the key assumptions.\n\nOur valuations expertise: We involved our own valuations specialists in the following:\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: We compared key assumptions including those underlying certain estimated future cash flows, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate to externally derived data including analyst broker reports, peer bank data and projected economic growth.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rate used by independently developing discount rate ranges using external data sources and peer bank data; and\n\nOur business understanding: We used our business understanding to evaluate the reasonableness of certain key assumptions and considerations made when (1) determining the capital allocation rate to reflect the relative risk profile of the CGU, (2) developing the Group's MTP estimated future cash flows and (3) adjusting from these forecasts for supportable circumstances that did not exist when the MTP was developed.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Assessing whether the methodology over the determination of the carrying value of each CGU on the basis of capital allocation as well as management's calculation of the VIU are compliant with the requirements of the accounting standard.\n\nHistorical comparison: We performed a retrospective review by comparing the MTP from previous years to actual results to assess the Group's ability to accurately prepare cash flow forecasts at the individual CGU level.\n\nAssessing transparency: We assessed whether the group's disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets as well as the resulting impact on headroom of the adjustments made to the Group's MTP for purposes of the impairment assessment.\n\nConsistency comparison: We assessed the consistency of pre-adjusted forecasted future cash flows used within management's impairment assessment to the Board approved MTP.\n\nAs set out in the disclosures on page 335, the available headroom for Personal Banking CGU has been adversely impacted by changes in the operating environment, resulting in a material reduction compared to the prior year. This has significantly increased the sensitivity of the impairment assessment to certain key assumptions such that a small movement in the key assumptions could have a material impact on the carrying value of the Personal Banking CGU. We therefore exercised judgement, based on our assessment of reasonably possible assumptions, as to whether it is acceptable or not to record an impairment, and we exercised judgement to determine the appropriateness of disclosures of the risk that a reasonable change in assumptions could lead to an impairment.",

Small changes have a significant impact on the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligation.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the defined benefit pension obligation and certain difficult-tovalue level 3 pension assets had a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group reported a pension asset surplus of \u00a31.8bn relating to UKRF.\n\nThe defined benefit plan disclosures are key to explaining the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Controls over management's review of IAS19 assumptions including discount rate, mortality assumptions and the RPI volatility impact on pension increases as well as the methodology used;\n\nControl testing: We performed end to end process walk-throughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the defined benefit obligation process.

User access management controls are an important component of the General IT Control environment assuring that unauthorised access to systems does not impact the effective operation of the automated controls in the financial reporting processes.\n\nA series of remediation programmes were in place during the year to address previously identified control deficiencies. The Group has also enhanced compensating controls to address the issues raised, most of them relating to user access management.\n\nIf the above controls for user access management are deficient and not remediated or adequately mitigated, the pervasive nature of these controls may undermine our ability to place reliance on automated and IT dependent controls in our audit.\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our response to the Key Audit Matter which included the use of IT specialists to perform the testing.\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Board Audit Committee:\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Authorising access rights for new joiners;\n\nControl testing: We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant controls over user access management including:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Timely removal of user access rights;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Privileged user and developer access to production systems, the procedures to assess granting, potential use, and the removal of these access rights;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Logging and monitoring of user activities;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Segregation of duties including access to multiple systems that could circumvent segregation controls;\n\nWe tested the implementation and operating effectiveness of management's remediated Access Management controls and found them to be effective in 2020.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Re-certification of user access rights.\n\nControl re-performance: To assess whether additional detective compensating controls adequately address the risk of unauthorised access, we re-performed on a sample basis management's assessment of potential unauthorised access by privileged accounts and users that were not managed by the strategic access management tools, or whose database level activities were not logged and monitored.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Key Audit Matter relates to determining whether user access management controls were designed and implemented and operated effectively.

These assumptions, which are judgemental, are derived from a combination of management estimates, market data and other information obtained from external sources.\n\nThe Company's investment in subsidiaries may be misstated if the carrying value of the investment in the balance sheet is not supported by the future cash flows of the underlying business (the value in use).\n\nIn 2020 an impairment of \u00a32.6bn was recognised against the Parent Company's investment in BBUK PLC. This was due to the impact of COVID-19 on the macro-economic environment which led to a reduction in the forecast cashflows used in the value in use calculation.\n\nWe have also continued to consider the Group's current market capitalisation. While any impairment of the carrying value of subsidiaries does not affect the consolidated results of the Group, it does impact distributable reserves.\n\nOur work focused on the Parent Company's investment in BBUK PLC as the quantum of the impairment recognised has a high sensitivity to the key assumptions.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the recoverability of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries had a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\n\nThe disclosures are key to explaining the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The rationale for increasing the level of risk associated with this Key Audit Matter for the previous period, specifically with regards to the retail bank;\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Board Audit Committee:\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Methodology assessment: We assessed (relative to the requirements of the accounting standard) the appropriateness of Group's impairment methodology for the determination of the VIU.\n\nControl testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the process of estimating value in use. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating to the process. These included controls over application of the impairment methodology, preparation of the estimated future cash flows and review of the key assumptions in determining the value in use.\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: We compared key assumptions including those underlying certain estimated future cash flows, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate to externally derived data including analyst broker reports, peer bank data and projected economic growth.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rate used by independently developing discount rate ranges using external data sources and peer bank data; and\n\nOur valuations expertise: We involved our own valuations specialists in the following:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Assessing whether the methodology over management's calculation of the VIU is compliant with the requirements of the accounting standard.\n\nHistorical comparison: We performed a retrospective review by comparing the MTP from previous years to actual results to assess the Group's ability to accurately prepare cash flow forecasts at the individual subsidiary level.\n\nOur business understanding: We used our business understanding to evaluate the reasonableness of certain key assumptions and considerations made when (1) developing the Group's MTP estimated future cash flows and (2) adjusting from these forecasts for supportable circumstances that did not exist when the MTP was developed.\n\nConsistency comparison: We assessed the consistency of pre-adjusted forecasted future cash flows used within management's impairment assessment to the Board approved MTP.\n\nAssessing transparency: We assessed whether the group's disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the assessment of recoverable amount of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our audit response to the Key Audit Matter which included the use of specialists to challenge key aspects of management's impairment assessment;\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we consider the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries balance and the related disclosures to be acceptable (2019 result: acceptable).\n\nWe identified the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying the estimated future cash flows and appropriateness of the discount rate and terminal growth rate, each of which were used in the impairment assessment, as the areas of particular judgement.\n\n.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our analysis of management's impairment methodology and certain adjustments made by management from the Group's MTP cash flows while performing the impairment assessment, including the resulting impact on the VIU of the investment in BBUK PLC and our audit response to these adjustments;",

Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response\n\n## Fraud risk assessment\n\n## Fraud - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. In this risk assessment we considered the following:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Enquiries of operational managers, internal audit, and the Board Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of Compliance and Group Head of Legal and reviews of Barclays' internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations;\n- -detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and\n- -the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud, including the appropriateness and impact of changes made to these controls in response to COVID-19;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Group's remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group and Company, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries. The forensic specialists participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions and were consulted throughout the audit where further guidance was deemed necessary.\n\n## Fraud risk communication\n\n## Fraud risks and our procedures to address them\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level.\n\nWe have identified six fraud risks which were communicated to specific component audit teams. The nature of these fraud risks is substantially unchanged from the prior year but the allocation of certain fraud risks to components has been updated. The fraud risks we identified are set out below:\n\n- 2) The recognition and measurement of ECL impairment of individually assessed loans\n- 1) Judgemental qualitative adjustments made to the ECL provision\n- 3) The valuation of unobservable pricing inputs used in used to price level 3 fair value instruments\n- 5) Existence and accuracy of unconfirmed over-the-counter bilateral trades\n- 4) Cut-off of the recognition of revenue from investment banking advisory fees\n- 6) The risk of management override of controls, common with all audits under ISAs (UK).\n\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the design and implementation and operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls, assessing significant accounting estimates for bias, as well as substantive procedures to address the fraud risks.\n\nAs required by auditing standards and taking into account our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to address the above risks and the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements.\n\nThese procedures also included identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.\n\n## Incorporating unpredictability into our audit:\n\nAs an example, we extended our testing of IFRS 9 models to include expanded testing on a number of lower risk models. We also increased the population of Level 3 financial instruments which we perform independent re-pricing over.\n\nA requirement of the auditing standards is that we undertake procedures which are deliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been predicted by Barclays' management.\n\n## Link to key audit matters\n\n## Laws and regulations - Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nFurther detail in respect of the testing we perform over the fraud risks we have identified for ECL and fair value of financial instruments is included in the respective key audit matters sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this report, as the procedures relating to those estimates also address the risk of fraud.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 our general commercial and sector experience;\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. For this risk assessment, matters considered included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards);\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 inspection of the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence;\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 relevant discussions with the Group's external legal counsel; and\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 relevant discussions with the Group's key regulatory supervisors including the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Joint Supervisory Team.",

        "page_content": "As the Group operates in a highly regulated environment, our assessment of risks of material misstatement also considered the control environment, including the entity's higher-level procedures for complying with regulatory requirements. Our assessment included inspection of key frameworks, policies and standards in place, understanding and evaluating the role of the compliance function in establishing these and monitoring compliance and testing of related controls around whistleblowing and complaints.\n\nOur communication of identified laws and regulations risks was made throughout our team and we remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level.\n\n## Risk communication\n\n## Direct laws context and link to audit\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly impact the financial statements including:\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 financial reporting legislation (including related companies' legislation);\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 taxation legislation (direct and indirect).\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 distributable profits legislation; and\n\nWe assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\n## Most significant indirect law/regulation areas\n\nWe identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's permission to operate in countries where the non-adherence to laws could prevent trading in such countries.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Specific aspects of regulatory capital and liquidity\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Money laundering\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Customer conduct rules\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Sanctions list and financial crime\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Market abuse regulations\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. If a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\nIn relation to the legal, competition and regulatory matters disclosed in note 26 we performed audit procedures which included making enquiries of Barclays internal counsel and inspection of minutes of meetings and regulatory correspondence. For a subset of these matters which we deem to be more significant we also made enquiries of external counsel and obtained legal confirmations from Barclays' external counsel.\n\n## Audit response\n\nIn respect of regulatory matters relating to conduct risk our procedures included inspection of regulatory correspondence, independent enquiry of the Group's main regulators and performing audit procedures to respond to risks of material misstatement identified in recognised conduct provisions.\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

Our determination of materiality\n\n## Materiality for the financial statements\u00a0as a whole\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## What we mean\n\n2020: \u00a3230m\n\n2019: \u00a3250m\n\nThis is the amount representing the total magnitude of misstatements that we expect to influence the economic decisions of the users of these financial statements.\n\nConsistent with FY19, we determined that profit before tax from continuing operations, normalised using our professional judgement, remains the key benchmark for the Barclays PLC Group to use in setting auditor's materiality. For FY20 we have normalised profit before tax from continuing operations by \u00a32.1bn to adjust for the impact of COVID-19 on the ECL charge. For FY 19 we normalised this benchmark by \u00a31.4bn to exclude charges related to conduct.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe normalise profit before tax by excluding certain items which significantly distort results in any one particular year. In our view, the use of a normalised profit before tax in which, for 2020, we have excluded the identified impact of COVID-19 on the ECL charge, provides a more appropriate amount to use as a benchmark for setting our materiality level. In FY 19 we excluded material charges related to PPI provisions which was recognised in response to a significant increase in complaints ahead of the time-bar for new complaints which was implemented in August 2019.\n\nIn determining the materiality benchmark, we had regard to investor commentary on the group, and the process followed by investors who also typically remove charges of this nature as they seek to derive a profit before tax amount to use as the basis for investment appraisal.\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements was set at \u00a3225m (2019: \u00a3245m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company net assets (of which it represents 0.3% (2019: 0.4%)).\n\nOur materiality of \u00a3230m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised Profit Before Tax. When using a profit-related measure to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach is to apply a percentage between 3-5% to the pre-tax measure. In setting overall materiality, we applied a rate of 4.4% (2019: 4.3%) which is lower than the top end of the allowable percentage range. Our materiality of \u00a3230m was lower than the prior year reflecting the increased risks arising from COVID-19.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\n2020: \u00a3170m 2019: \u00a3185m\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 74% (2019: 74%) of materiality for Barclays PLC Group's financial statements as a whole to be appropriate. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nThe company performance materiality was set at \u00a3160m (2019: \u00a3184m).\n\n|                                   | Total Revenue   | Total Revenue   | Total Assets   | Total Assets   | Net Assets   | Net Assets   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                   | 2020            | 2019            | 2020           | 2019           | 2020         | 2019         |\n|                                   | \u00a321,776m        | \u00a321,632m        | \u00a31,349,514m    | \u00a31,140,229m    | \u00a365,797m     | \u00a365,660m     |\n| Group Materiality as % of caption | 1.06%           | 1.16%           | 0.02%          | 0.02%          | 0.34%        | 0.38%        |\n\n## Audit misstatement posting threshold 2020: \u00a311m 2019: \u00a312m\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of differences below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller differences which are indicators of fraud.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is also the amount above which all differences identified are communicated to Barclays PLC's Board Audit Committee\n\nThe audit misstatement posting threshold has been set at a level of 5% of materiality for Barclays PLC's Group financial statements. We consider this appropriate based on the number and nature of audit differences (adjusted and unadjusted) identified during previous audits.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement reporting threshold and judgements applied\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group of \u00a3230m (2019: \u00a3250m) determined with reference to a benchmark of normalised PBT of which it represents 4.4% (2019: 4.3%), compares as follows to the other main financial statement elements amounts.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group of \u00a3230m (2019: \u00a3250m), determined with reference to a benchmark of normalised PBT of which it represents 4.4% (2019: 4.3%), compares as follows to the other main financial statement elements amounts.",

Respective responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 107, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities\n\n.\n\n## 10.

the accounting policies applied. Amendments have been made to the classification of cash collateral reported within cash and cash equivalents and to the presentation of items within net cash flows from operating and investing activities. Footnotes b and c below quantify the impact of the changes to the respective cash flow categories in prior periods and provide further detail.\n- c Movements in cash and cash equivalents relating to debt securities at amortised cost were previously shown within loans and advances to banks and customers in operating activities. These debt securities holdings are now considered to be part of the investing activity performed by the Group following a change in accounting policy and have been presented within investing activities in 2020. Comparatives have been restated. The effect of this change was to reclassify \u00a311,139m of net cash outflows from operating activities to investing activities in 2019 and inflows of \u00a3570m in 2018.\n- b 'Cash collateral balances with central banks with original maturity less than three months' was previously labelled 'Cash collateral and settlement balances with banks with original maturity less than three months'. This line item has been restated to include only balances that the Group holds at central banks related to payment schemes. Previously, cash collateral and settlement balances with non-central bank counterparties were also classified as cash equivalents and included within this balance. Comparatives have been restated. The effect of this change decreased cash and cash equivalents by \u00a316,774m as at 31 December 2019, \u00a317,429m as at 31 December 2018 and \u00a318,683 as at 31 December 2017. As a result, net cash from operating activities increased by \u00a3655m in 2019 and \u00a31,254m in 2018 representing the net decrease/(increase) in the cash collateral and settlement balances line item in those periods.\n- d  Issuance of debt securities included in financing activities relate to instruments that qualify as eligible liabilities and satisfy regulatory requirements for MREL instruments which came into effect during 2019.\n\nInterest received was \u00a318,748m (2019: \u00a334,061m; 2018: \u00a326,254m) and interest paid was \u00a39,577m (2019: \u00a323,186m; 2018: \u00a316,124m). The Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities and these amounted to \u00a33,392m (2019: \u00a34,893m; 2018: \u00a34,717m). For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits and cash equivalents comprise highly liquid investments that are convertible into cash with an insignificant risk of changes in value with original maturities of three months or less. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are not considered to be part of cash equivalents.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## For the year ended 31 December 2020\n\nThis section describes the Group's significant policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole. If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a particular note, the accounting policy and/or critical accounting estimate is contained with the relevant note.\n\n## 1 Significant accounting policies\n\n## 1. Reporting entity\n\n## 2. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThese financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services. In addition, separate financial statements have been presented for the holding company.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations (IFRICs) as issued by the IASB and adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. These standards have also been endorsed by the UK. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied with the exception of the early adoption of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS16) which was applied from 1 January 2020.\n\nThe consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies. They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling (\u00a3m), the functional currency of Barclays PLC.\n\n## 3. Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board is satisfied that the Group and the parent company have the resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from approval of the financial statements.\n\nThe WCR showed that the Group had sufficient capital in place to support its future business requirements and remained above its regulatory minimum requirements in the stress scenarios. Accordingly, the Directors concluded that there was a reasonable expectation that the Group and parent company has adequate resources to continue as a Going Concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n\nIn making this assessment, the Board has considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions and includes a review of a working capital report (WCR). The WCR is used by the Directors to assess the future performance of the business and that it has the resources in place that are required to meet its ongoing regulatory requirements. The assessment is based upon business plans which contain future projections of profitability taken from the Group's three year medium-term plan as well as projections of regulatory capital requirements and business funding needs. The WCR also includes an assessment of the impact of internally generated stress testing scenarios on the liquidity and capital requirement forecasts. The stress tests used were based upon an assessment of reasonably possible downside economic scenarios that the Group could experience.\n\n## 4. Accounting policies\n\n## (i) Consolidation\n\nThe Group prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The Group's significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out under the relevant notes. Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements\n\n.\n\n1) power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights\n\nThe consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which Barclays PLC has control. The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following:\n\n2) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n\nThe assessment of control is based on the consideration of all facts and circumstances. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\n3) the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnership financial statements.\n\nChanges in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.\n\nDetails of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 34.",

        "page_content": "## 1 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Group's foreign operations (including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches) based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies. The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates . Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary foreign currency balances in relation to items measured in terms of historical cost are carried at historical transaction date exchange rates. Non-monetary foreign currency balances in relation to items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was measured.\n\nPrior to consolidation (or equity accounting) the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the period end exchange rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the Group disposes of the entire interest in a foreign operation, when partial disposal results in the loss of control of an interest in a subsidiary, when an investment previously accounted for using the equity method is accounted for as a financial asset, or on the disposal of an autonomous foreign operation within a branch.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and the impairment of financial assets. The Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes.\n\n## (iii) Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Recognition\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract. Trade date or settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets are classified on the basis of two criteria:\n\nii) their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).\n\n- i) the business model within which financial assets are managed, and\n\nThe Group assesses the business model criteria at a portfolio level. Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model includes (i) policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, (ii) how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management, and (iii) the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for such sales.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\n\nThe contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI. In assessing whether contractual cash flows are SPPI compliant, interest is defined as consideration primarily for the time value of money and the credit risk of the principal outstanding. The time value of money is defined as the element of interest that provides consideration only for the passage of time and not consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the financial asset. Terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including: (i) contingent and leverage features, (ii) non-recourse arrangements and (iii) features that could modify the time value of money.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\n\nThe accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item. The Group's policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 17.\n\nOther financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss. There is an option to make an irrevocable election on initial recognition for non traded equity investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in which case dividends are recognised in profit or loss, but gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition, and the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 do not apply.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms - generally a difference of 10% or more in the present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment - is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.\n\nTransactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred. It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. Such an analysis compares the Group's exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## For the year ended 31 December 2020 continued\n\n## 1 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nA cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement. In particular, it is necessary to estimate the asset's expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation. The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible. The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios. Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario. Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements (and stock borrowing or similar transaction) are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future. Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.\n\n## Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing\n\nThe Group purchases (a reverse repurchase agreement) or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them. The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration paid (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated or mandatorily at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## (iv) Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nThe Group may also sell (a repurchase agreement) or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration received (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation , to determine whether funding is either a financial liability (debt) or equity.\n\nWhere issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately. The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.\n\nIssued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having an obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs. Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the AGM and treated as a deduction from equity.\n\n## 5. New and amended standards and interpretations\n\n## IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Amendments relating to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 2 amendments)\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, with the exception of the early adoption of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) which was applied from 1 January 2020.\n\nIFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 were amended in August 2020, which are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 with earlier adoption permitted. The Group elected to early adopt the amendments with effect from 1 January 2020. The amendments have been endorsed by the EU and by the UK.\n\nThe objective of the amendments is to provide certain reliefs to companies when changes are made to the contractual cash flows or hedging relationships resulting from interest rate benchmark reform. The reliefs adopted by the Group have been described below.\n\nIFRS 9 allows companies when they first apply IFRS 9, to make an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. The Group made the election to continue to apply the IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements, and consequently, the amendments to IAS 39 in respect of hedge accounting have been adopted by the Group.\n\n## Changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nA change in the basis of determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument that are required by the reform is accounted for by updating the effective interest rate, without the recognition of an immediate gain or loss. This practical expedient is only applied where (1) the change to the contractual cash flows is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform and (2) the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis. For changes made in addition to those required by the reform, the practical expedient is applied first, after which the normal IFRS 9 requirements for modifications of financial instruments is applied.\n\nThe IAS 39 requirements in respect of hedge accounting have been amended in two phases. The Phase 1 amendments, which were adopted by the Group in 2019, provide relief to the hedge accounting requirements prior to changing a hedge relationship due to the interest rate benchmark reform (refer to Note 14). The Phase 2 amendments provide relief when changes are made to hedge relationships as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. The Phase 2 amendments adopted by the Group are described below.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 In respect of the retrospective hedge effectiveness assessment, the Group may elect on a hedge-by-hedge basis to reset the cumulative fair value changes to zero when the exception to the retrospective assessment ends (Phase 1 relief). Any hedge ineffectiveness will continue to be measured and recognised in full in profit or loss.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Under a temporary exception, changes to the hedge designation and hedge documentation due to the interest rate benchmark reform would not constitute the discontinuation of the hedge relationship nor the designation of a new hedging relationship.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve would be deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate (on which the hedge future cash flows are determined) when there is a change in basis for determining the contractual cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## 1 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 For hedges of groups of items (such as those forming part of a macro cash flow hedging strategy), the amendments provide relief for items within a designated group of items that are amended for changes directly required by the reform.\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 7 require certain disclosures to be made to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of interest rate benchmark reform on an entity's financial instruments and risk management strategy. Refer to Note 41 where these disclosures have been included.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 In respect of whether a risk component of a hedged item is separately identifiable, the amendments provide temporary relief to entities to meet this requirement when an alternative risk free rate (RFR) financial instrument is designated as a risk component. These amendments allow entities upon designation of the hedge to assume that the separately identifiable requirement is met if the entity reasonably expects the RFR risk will become separately identifiable within the next 24 months. This relief applies to each RFR on a rate-by-rate basis and starts when the entity first designates the RFR as a non-contractually specified risk component.\n\n## Future accounting developments\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts\n\nThe following accounting standards have been issued by the IASB but are not yet effective:\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005.\n\nIn June 2020, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 17. The amendments that are relevant to the Group are the scope exclusion for credit card contracts and similar contracts that provide insurance coverage, the optional scope exclusion for loan contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, and the clarification that only financial guarantees issued are in the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nIFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e. life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply.\n\nThe amendments also defer the effective date of IFRS 17, including the above amendments, to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nFollowing the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 31 December 2020, the UK-adopted international accounting standards will be applicable. IFRS 17, including the amendments to IFRS 17, has not yet been endorsed by the UK. The Group is currently assessing the expected impact of adopting this standard.\n\nIFRS 17, including the amendments to IFRS 17, has not yet been endorsed by the EU as of the date that the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\n## 6.

To the extent these costs are attributed to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) and incremental to the origination of credit card balances, they are capitalised and subsequently included within the calculation of the effective interest rate. They are amortised to interest income over the period of expected repayment of the originated balance. Costs attributed to customers that settle their outstanding balances each period (transactors) are deferred on the balance sheet as a cost of obtaining a contract and amortised to fee and commission expense over the life of the customer relationship (refer to Note 4). There are no other individual estimates involved in the calculation of effective interest rates that are material to the results or financial position.\n\n|                                               | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 a \u00a3m   | 2018 a \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Cash and balances at central banks            | 275       | 1,091       | 1,123       |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost          | 10,180    | 12,450      | 12,073      |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income | 776       | 1,032       | 1,029       |\n| Negative interest on liabilities              | 68        | 13          | 35          |\n| Other                                         | 593       | 870         | 281         |\n| Interest and similar income                   | 11,892    | 15,456      | 14,541      |\n| Deposits at amortised cost                    | (1,030)   | (2,449)     | (2,250)     |\n| Debt securities in issue b                    | (1,360)   | (1,906)     | (1,677)     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                      | (670)     | (1,068)     | (1,223)     |\n| Negative interest on assets                   | (344)     | (278)       | (270)       |\n| Other                                         | (366)     | (348)       | (59)        |\n| Interest and similar expense                  | (3,770)   | (6,049)     | (5,479)     |\n| Net interest income                           | 8,122     | 9,407       | 9,062       |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Barclays has amended the presentation of the premium paid for purchased financial guarantees which are embedded in notes it issues directly to the market. From 2020 onwards, the full note coupon (\u00a399m) is presented as interest expense within net interest income. The financial guarantee element of the coupon had previously been recognised in net investment income (2019: \u00a325m; 2018: \u00a31m). The comparatives have not been restated.\n- a Comparatives for negative interest income on liabilities and negative interest expense on assets have been re-presented from Other interest income and Other interest expense.\n\nInterest and similar income presented above represents interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method. Costs to originate credit card balances of \u00a3698m (2019: \u00a3697m; 2018: \u00a3596m) have been amortised to interest and similar income during the year. Interest and similar income includes \u00a340m (2019: \u00a348m; 2018: \u00a353m) accrued on impaired loans. Other interest expense includes \u00a370m (2019: \u00a376m) relating to IFRS 16 lease interest expenses.",

Where the contractual arrangements also result in the Group recognising financial instruments in scope of IFRS 9, such financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 before applying the provisions of IFRS 15.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model governing revenue recognition. The five-step model requires the Group to (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify each of the performance obligations included in the contract, (iii) determine the amount of consideration in the contract, (iv) allocate the consideration to each of the identified performance obligations and (v) recognise revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.\n\nFee and commission income is disaggregated below by fee types that reflect the nature of the services offered across the Group and operating segments, in accordance with IFRS 15.

These include interchange and merchant fee income generated from credit and bank card usage. Transaction and processing fees are recognised at the point in time the transaction occurs or service is performed. Interchange and merchant fees are recognised upon settlement of the card transaction payment.\n\n## Advisory\n\nThe Group incurs certain card related costs including those related to cardholder reward programmes and payments to co-brand partners. Cardholder reward programmes costs related to customers that settle their outstanding balance each period (transactors) are expensed when incurred and presented in fee and commission expense while costs related to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Payments to partners for new cardholder account originations related to transactor accounts are deferred as costs to obtain a contract under IFRS 15, while costs related to revolver accounts are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Those costs deferred under IFRS 15 are capitalised and amortised over the estimated life of the customer relationship. Payments to co-brand partners based on revenue sharing are presented as a reduction of fee and commission income while payments based on profitability are presented in fee and commission expense.\n\nAdvisory fees are generated from wealth management services and investment banking advisory services related to mergers, acquisitions and financial restructurings. Wealth management advisory fees are earned over the period the services are provided and are generally recognised quarterly when the market value of client assets is determined. Investment banking advisory fees are recognised at the point in time when the services related to the transaction have been completed under the terms of the engagement. Investment banking advisory costs are recognised as incurred in fee and commission expense if direct and incremental to the advisory services or are otherwise recognised in operating expenses.\n\nBrokerage and execution fees are earned for executing client transactions with various exchanges and over the counter markets and assisting clients in clearing transactions. Brokerage and execution fees are recognised at the point in time the associated service has been completed which is generally the trade date of the transaction.\n\n## Brokerage and execution\n\n## Underwriting and syndication\n\nIncluded in the underwriting and syndication fees are loan commitment fees which are not presented as part of the carrying value of the loan in accordance with IFRS 9. Such commitment fees are recognised over time through to the contractual maturity of the commitment.\n\nUnderwriting and syndication fees are earned for the distribution of client equity or debt securities and the arrangement and administration of a loan syndication. This includes commitment fees to provide loan financing. Underwriting fees are generally recognised on trade date if there is no remaining contingency, such as the transaction being conditional on the closing of an acquisition or another transaction. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognised in fee and commission expense when the associated underwriting fees are recorded. Syndication fees are earned for arranging and administering a loan syndication; however, the associated fee may be subject to variability until the loan has been syndicated to other syndicate members or until other contingencies have been resolved and therefore the fee revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved.\n\n## Contract assets and contract liabilities\n\n## Impairment of fee receivables and contract assets\n\nThe Group had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as at 31 December 2020 (2019: nil; 2018: nil).\n\nDuring 2020, there have been no material impairments recognised in relation to fees receivable and contract assets (2019: nil; 2018: nil). Fees in relation to transactional business can be added to outstanding customer balances. These amounts may be subsequently impaired as part of the overall loans and advances balance.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less or because the Group has a right to consideration that corresponds directly with the value of the service provided to the client or customer.\n\n## Remaining performance obligations\n\n## Costs incurred in obtaining or fulfilling a contract\n\nCapitalised contract costs are amortised based on the transfer of services to which the asset relates which typically ranges over the expected life of the relationship. In 2020, the amount of amortisation was \u00a336m (2019: \u00a330m; 2018: \u00a330m) and there was no impairment loss recognised in connection with the capitalised contract costs (2019: nil; 2018: nil).\n\nThe Group expects that incremental costs of obtaining a contract such as success fee and commission fees paid are recoverable and therefore capitalised such contract costs in the amount of \u00a3141m at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a3159m; 2018: \u00a3125m).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Financial performance and returns continued\n\n## 7 Credit impairment charges\n\n## Accounting for the impairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the Group is required to recognise expected credit losses (ECLs) based on unbiased forward-looking information for all financial assets at amortised cost, lease receivables, debt financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.\n\n## Impairment\n\nAt the reporting date, an allowance (or provision for loan commitments and financial guarantees) is required for the 12 month (Stage 1) ECLs. If the credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition (Stage 2), or if the financial instrument is credit impaired (Stage 3), an allowance (or provision) should be recognised for the lifetime ECLs.\n\nThe 12 month and lifetime ECLs are calculated by multiplying the respective PD, LGD and the EAD. The 12 month and lifetime PDs represent the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively. The EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money.\n\nThe measurement of ECL is calculated using three main components: (i) probability of default (PD) (ii) loss given default (LGD) and (iii) the exposure at default (EAD).\n\nDetermining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition:\n\n## i) Quantitative test\n\nThe Group assesses when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative assessments. The credit risk of an exposure is considered to have significantly increased when:\n\nThe annualised lifetime PD has increased by more than an agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.\n\nThe assessment of the point at which a PD increase is deemed 'significant', is based upon analysis of the portfolio's risk profile against a common set of principles and performance metrics (consistent across both retail and wholesale businesses), incorporating expert credit judgement where appropriate. Application of quantitative PD floors does not represent the use of the low credit risk exemption as exposures can separately move into Stage 2 via the qualitative route described below.\n\nPD deterioration thresholds are defined as percentage increases, and are set at an origination score band and segment level to ensure the test appropriately captures significant increases in credit risk at all risk levels. Generally, thresholds are inversely correlated to the origination PD, i.e. as the origination PD increases, the threshold value reduces.\n\nWholesale assets apply a 100% increase in PD and 0.2% PD floor to determine a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor existing/historical exposures where origination point scores or data are no longer available or do not represent a comparable estimate of lifetime PD, a proxy origination score is defined, based upon:\n\nRetail assets apply bespoke relative increase and absolute PD thresholds based on product type and origination PD. Thresholds are subject to maximums defined by Group policy and typically apply minimum relative thresholds of 50-100% and a maximum relative threshold of 400%.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 back-population of the approved lifetime PD score either to origination date or, where this is not feasible, as far back as possible (subject to a data start point no later than 1 January 2015); or\n\n## ii) Qualitative test\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 use of available historical account performance data and other customer information, to derive a comparable 'proxy' estimation of origination PD.\n\nThis is relevant for accounts that meet the portfolio's 'high risk' criteria and are subject to closer credit monitoring.\n\nWhilst the high risk populations applied for IFRS 9 impairment purposes are aligned with risk management processes, they are also regularly reviewed and validated to ensure that they capture any incremental segments where there is evidence of credit deterioration.\n\nHigh risk customers may not be in arrears but either through an event or an observed behaviour exhibit credit distress. The definition and assessment of high risk includes as wide a range of information as reasonably available, such as industry and Group-wide customer level data, including but not limited to bureau scores and high consumer indebtedness index, wherever possible or relevant.\n\n## iii) Backstop criteria\n\nThe criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk for assets with bullet repayments follows the same principle as all other assets, i.e. quantitative, qualitative and backstop tests are all applied.\n\nThis is relevant for accounts that are more than 30 calendar days past due. The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a primary driver of moving exposures into Stage 2.\n\nExposures will move back to Stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk. This means that, at a minimum all payments must be up-to-date, the PD deterioration test is no longer met, the account is no longer classified as high risk, and the customer has evidenced an ability to maintain future payments.",

Exposures being removed from Stage 3 must no longer qualify as credit impaired, and:\n\nb) (for non-forborne exposures) the performance conditions are defined and approved within an appropriately sanctioned restructure plan, including 12 months' payment history have been met.\n\na) the obligor will also have demonstrated consistently good payment behaviour over a 12-month period, by making all consecutive contractual payments due and, for forborne exposures, the relevant EBA defined probationary period has also been successfully completed or;\n\nManagement overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant increases in credit risk.\n\nThe measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of PD, LGD, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives (where contractual life is not appropriate), and estimation of EAD and assessing significant increases in credit risk.\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nCredit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). ECLs are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and considering future economic conditions.\n\nThe methodology for estimating probability weights for each of the scenarios involves a comparison of the distribution of key historical UK and US macroeconomic variables against the forecast paths of the five scenarios. The methodology works such that the baseline (reflecting current consensus outlook) has the highest weight and the weights of adverse and favourable scenarios depend on the deviation from the baseline; the further from the baseline, the smaller the weight. A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are normalised to equate to 100%. The same scenarios and weights that are used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used for the Group internal planning purposes. The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment.\n\nThe Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury (short and medium term forecasts), Bloomberg (based on median of economic forecasts) and the Urban Land Institute (for US House Prices), which forms the baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two favourable scenarios (Upside 1 and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a similar severity to internal stress tests, whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. Downside 2 is benchmarked to the Bank of England's annual cyclical scenarios and to the most severe scenario from Moody's inventory, but is not designed to be the same. The favourable scenarios are calibrated to be symmetric to the adverse scenarios, subject to a ceiling calibrated to relevant recent favourable benchmark scenarios. The scenarios include eight economic variables (GDP, unemployment and House Price Index (HPI) in both the UK and US markets) and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to evolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately eight years.\n\n## Definition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition\n\nAn asset is considered credit impaired when one or more events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent default or actual loss is identified.\n\nThe definition of default for the purpose of determining ECLs, and for internal credit risk management purposes, has been aligned to the Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, to maintain a consistent approach with IFRS 9 and associated regulatory guidance. The Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes exposures in forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due or 180 days past due in the case of UK mortgages. When exposures are identified as credit impaired at the time when they are purchased or originated interest income is calculated on the carrying value net of the impairment allowance.\n\nUncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Group's internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of subjective judgement. Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other formal recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery.\n\nThe Group may enter into a financial guarantee contract which requires the issuer of such contract to reimburse the Group for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. For these separate financial guarantee contracts, the Group recognises a reimbursement asset aligned with the recognition of the underlying ECLs, if it is considered virtually certain that a reimbursement would be received if the specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument.\n\n## Accounting for purchased financial guarantee contracts",

This assessment considers both the change in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as the change in overall instrument risk profile. In respect of payment holidays granted to borrowers which are not due to forbearance, if the revised cash flows on a present value basis (based on the original EIR) are not substantially different from the original cash flows, the loan is not considered to be substantially modified.\n\nWhere terms are not substantially different, the loan carrying value will be adjusted to reflect the present value of modified cash flows discounted at the original EIR, with any resulting gain or loss recognised immediately within the income statement as a modification gain or loss.\n\n## Expected life\n\nNote 1 sets out details for changes in the basis of determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument that are required by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nLifetime ECLs must be measured over the expected life. This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account expected prepayment, extension, call and similar options. The exceptions are certain revolver financial instruments, such as credit cards and bank overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entity's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For revolving facilities, expected life is analytically derived to reflect the behavioural life of the asset, i.e. the full period over which the business expects to be exposed to credit risk. Behavioural life is typically based upon historical analysis of the average time to default, closure or withdrawal of facility. Where data is insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional 'maturity factor' may be incorporated to reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based upon experienced judgement and/or peer analysis. Potential future modifications of contracts are not taken into account when determining the expected life or EAD until they occur.\n\nECLs are discounted at the EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition. For loan commitments the EIR is the rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised. Issued financial guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk free rate. Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. For variable/floating rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the expected life are not made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.\n\n## Discounting\n\n## Modelling techniques\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 BCBS requires 12 month through the economic cycle losses whereas IFRS 9 requires 12 months or lifetime point in time losses based on conditions at the reporting date and multiple forecasts of the future economic conditions over the expected lives\n\nECLs are calculated by multiplying three main components, being the PD, LGD and the EAD, discounted at the original EIR. The regulatory Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors (BCBS) ECL calculations are leveraged for IFRS 9 modelling but adjusted for key differences which include:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 IFRS 9 models do not include certain conservative BCBS model floors and downturn assessments and require discounting to the reporting date at the original EIR rather than using the cost of capital to the date of default\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 ECL is measured at the individual financial instrument level, however a collective approach where financial instruments with similar risk characteristics are grouped together, with apportionment to individual financial instruments, is used where effects can only be seen at a collective level, for example for forward-looking information.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 management adjustments are made to modelled output to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information have not been considered in the modelling process, for example forecast economic scenarios for uncertain political events and\n\nFor the IFRS 9 impairment assessment, the Group's risk models are used to determine the PD, LGD and EAD. For Stage 2 and 3, the Group applies lifetime PDs but uses 12 month PDs for Stage 1. The ECL drivers of PD, EAD and LGD are modelled at an account level which considers vintage, among other credit factors. Also, the assessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on the initial lifetime PD curve, which accounts for the different credit risk underwritten over time.\n\nA financial asset is subject to forbearance when it is modified due to the credit distress of the borrower. A modification made to the terms of an asset due to forbearance will typically be assessed as a non-substantial modification that does not result in derecognition of the original loan, except in circumstances where debt is exchanged for equity.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nBoth performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as Stage 3 except where it is established that the concession granted has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definition of default criteria have been triggered, in which case the asset is classified as Stage 2. The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for performing forbearance, 24 months. Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a forborne state.\n\nNo financial instrument in forbearance can transfer back to Stage 1 until all of the Stage 2 thresholds are no longer met and can only move out of Stage 3 when no longer credit impaired.",

        "page_content": "## 7 Credit impairment charges continued\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nWithin the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, the impairment allowance is calculated using forward-looking modelled parameters which are typically run at account level. There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category. Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised. The impairment allowance reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable. The impairment charge reflected in the income statement for retail portfolios is \u00a33,116m (2019: \u00a31,696m; 2018: \u00a31,598m) of the total impairment charge on loans and advances and off balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.\n\nIFRS 9 impairment involves several important areas of judgement, including estimating forward looking modelled parameters (PD, LGD and EAD), developing a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimating expected lives and assessing significant increases in credit risk, based on the Group's experience of managing credit risk. The determination of expected life is most material for Barclays credit card portfolios which is obtained via behavioural life analysis to materially capture the risk of these facilities.\n\nFor individually significant assets in Stage 3, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows across a range of economic scenarios are taken into account. These considerations can be particularly subjective and can include the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Group's position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process. The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate), and its carrying amount. Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken. Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge. The impairment charge reflected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is a charge of \u00a31,569m (2019: \u00a3208m charge; 2018: \u00a3133m release) of the total impairment charge on loans and advances and off balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. Further information on impairment allowances, impairment charges, measurement uncertainty, sensitivity analysis and related credit information is set out within the Credit risk performance section.\n\nTemporary adjustments to calculated IFRS 9 impairment allowances may be applied in limited circumstances to account for situations where known or expected risk factors or information have not been considered in the ECL assessment or modelling process.

Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income. Income tax payable on taxable profits (current tax) is recognised as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise. Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes. Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior periods. Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of profit subject to tax may be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Group's tax returns. The Group accounts for provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions in two different ways.",

From recognition, the current tax provision is then measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position. Effective from 1 January 2019, the Group changed its accounting policy on the accrual of interest and penalty amounts in respect of uncertain income tax positions and now recognises such amounts as an expense within profit before tax and will continue to do so in future periods. The prior periods' tax charges have not been restated because the accrual for interest and penalties in those periods in respect of uncertain tax positions was not material.\n\nThe approach taken to measurement takes account of whether the uncertain tax position is a discrete position that will be reviewed by the tax authority in isolation from any other position, or one of a number of issues which are expected to be reviewed together concurrently and resolved simultaneously with a tax authority. The Group's measurement of provisions is based upon its best estimate of the additional profit that will become subject to tax. For a discrete position, consideration is given only to the merits of that position. Where a number of issues are expected to be reviewed and resolved together, the Group will take into account not only the merits of its position in respect of each particular issue but also the overall level of provision relative to the aggregate of the uncertain tax positions across all the issues that are expected to be resolved at the same time. In addition, in assessing provision levels, it is assumed that tax authorities will review uncertain tax positions and that all facts will be fully and transparently disclosed.\n\nDeferred tax provisions are adjustments made to the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of uncertain tax positions. A deferred tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will result in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset. From recognition of a provision, measurement of the underlying deferred tax asset is adjusted to take into account the expected impact of resolving the uncertain tax position on the loss or temporary difference giving rise to the deferred tax asset.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of current and deferred tax balances, including provisions for uncertain tax positions in the next financial year. The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a diverse range of issues and reflect advice from external counsel where relevant. It should be noted that only a proportion of the total uncertain tax positions will be under audit at any point in time, and could therefore be subject to challenge by a tax authority over the next year.\n\nThere are two key areas of judgement that impact the reported tax position. Firstly, the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions; and secondly, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets.\n\nDeferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts. Details on the recognition of deferred tax assets are provided in this note.\n\n|                                       | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current tax charge/(credit)           |           |           |           |\n| Current year                          | 1,255     | 1,037     | 689       |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | 31        | (45)      | (214)     |\n|                                       | 1,286     | 992       | 475       |\n| Deferred tax charge/(credit)          |           |           |           |\n| Current year                          | (830)     | 86        | 442       |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | 148       | (75)      | (6)       |\n|                                       | (682)     | 11        | 436       |\n| Tax charge                            | 604       | 1,003     | 911       |",

These factors, which have each increased the effective tax rate, are largely offset by the impact of non-taxable gains and income, tax relief on payments made under AT1 instruments, the use of unrecognised tax losses in the period and adjustments for the remeasurement of UK deferred tax assets as a result of the UK corporation tax rate being maintained at 19%.\n\n## Tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income can be found in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income which includes within Other a tax credit of \u00a35m (2019: \u00a316m) on other items including share-based payments.\n\nThe deferred tax amounts on the balance sheet were as follows:\n\n|                                                             | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| US Intermediate Holding Company Tax Group ('IHC Tax Group') | 1,001     | 1,037     |\n| US Branch Tax Group                                         | 1,048     | 1,015     |\n| UK Tax Group                                                | 886       | 818       |\n| Other (outside the UK and US tax groups)                    | 509       | 420       |\n| Deferred tax asset                                          | 3,444     | 3,290     |\n| Deferred tax liability                                      | (15)      | (23)      |\n| Net deferred tax                                            | 3,429     | 3,267     |",

The tax losses include capital losses of \u00a33,947m (2019: \u00a33,980m). Of these tax losses, \u00a3139m (2019: \u00a341m) expire within five years, \u00a3236m (2019: \u00a3239m) expire within six to 10 years, \u00a37,271m (2019: \u00a35,178m) expire within 11 to 20 years and \u00a313,267m (2019: \u00a314,124m) can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which they can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of the value of the Group's investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of these temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was \u00a30.8bn (2019: \u00a30.7bn).\n\n## Group investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates\n\n## 10 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                              |                          |                          |                          | 2020 \u00a3m                    | 2019 \u00a3m                    | 2018 \u00a3m                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent |                          |                          |                          | 1,526                      | 2,461                      | 1,597                      |\n|                                                              | 2020 million             | 2020 million             | 2020 million             |                            | 2019 million               | 2018 million               |\n| Basic weighted average number of shares in issue             |                          |                          |                          | 17,300                     | 17,200                     | 17,075                     |\n| Number of potential ordinary shares                          |                          |                          |                          | 368                        | 282                        | 308                        |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares                    |                          |                          |                          | 17,668                     | 17,482                     | 17,383                     |\n|                                                              | Basic earnings per share | Basic earnings per share | Basic earnings per share | Diluted earnings per share | Diluted earnings per share | Diluted earnings per share |\n|                                                              | 2020 p                   | 2019 p                   | 2018                     | 2020 p                     | 2019 p                     | 2018                       |\n| Earnings per ordinary share                                  | 8.8                      | 14.3                     | p 9.4                    | 8.6                        | 14.1                       | p 9.2                      |\n\nThe calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the basic weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares held in employee benefit trusts or held for trading. When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all expected dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 368m (2019: 282m) shares. The total number of share options outstanding, under schemes considered to be potentially dilutive, was 719m (2019: 533m). These options have strike prices ranging from \u00a30.84 to \u00a32.27.\n\nThe 100m (2019: 125m) increase in the basic weighted average number of shares are primarily due to shares issued under employee share schemes.\n\nOf the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2020, 69m (2019: 43m) were anti-dilutive.\n\n## 11 Dividends on ordinary shares\n\nThe Directors have approved a total dividend in respect of 2020 of 1.0p per ordinary share of 25p each. The full year dividend for 2020 of 1.0p per ordinary share will be paid on 1 April 2021 to shareholders on the Share Register on 26 February 2021. On 31 December 2020, there were 17,359m ordinary shares in issue. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 do not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders' equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2021. Dividends are funded out of distributable reserves.\n\nIn response to a request from the PRA, and to preserve additional capital for use in serving Barclays customers and clients through the extraordinary challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board agreed to cancel the 6.0p per ordinary share full year 2019 dividend.\n\nThe Directors have confirmed their intention to initiate a share buyback of up to \u00a3700m after the balance sheet date. The share buyback is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2021. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 do not reflect the impact of the proposed share buyback, which will be accounted for as and when shares are repurchased by the Company.",

Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes terms included in a contract or financial liability (the host), which, had it been a standalone contract, would have met the definition of a derivative. If these are separated from the host, i.e. when the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related with those of the host contract and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, then they are accounted for in the same way as derivatives. For financial assets, the requirements are whether the financial assets contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, and consequently the requirements for accounting for embedded derivatives are not applicable to financial assets.\n\nDerivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract. They include swaps, forward-rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Group's net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet. Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, credit risk, inflation risk, exchange rate, commodity equity exposures, and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group has applied the 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform' issued in September 2019. In accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of the reporting period or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that date.\n\nThe Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes. The Group applies hedge accounting to represent the economic effects of its interest rate, currency and contractually linked inflation risk management strategies. Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.\n\nThe amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR ('Interbank Offered Rates') reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in the income statement. Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which include the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 When considering the 'highly probable' requirement, the Group has assumed that the IBOR interest rates upon which our hedged items are based do not change as a result of IBOR reform.\n\nIn summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments that apply to the Group are:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis the Group has assumed that the IBOR interest rates upon which the cash flows of the hedged items and the interest rate swaps that hedge them are based are not altered by IBOR reform.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Group has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the reforms are expected to take effect.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Group will not discontinue hedge accounting during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective effectiveness falls outside the required 80-125% range.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The Group has assessed whether the hedged IBOR risk component is a separately identifiable risk only when it first designates a hedged item in a fair value hedge and not on an ongoing basis.",

        "page_content": "## 14 Derivative financial instruments continued\n\nThe Group has elected to early adopt the 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2' issued in August 2020. The Phase 2 amendments provide relief when changes are made to hedge relationships as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 under a temporary exception, the Group has considered that changes to the hedge designation and hedge documentation due to the interest rate benchmark reform would not constitute the discontinuation of the hedge relationship nor the designation of a new hedging relationship\n\nThe Phase 2 amendments adopted by the Group are:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 in respect of the retrospective hedge effectiveness assessment, the Group may elect, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to reset the cumulative fair value changes to zero when the exception to the retrospective assessment ends (Phase 1 relief). Any hedge ineffectiveness will continue to be measured and recognised in full in profit or loss\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 for hedges of groups of items (such as those forming part of a macro cash flow hedging strategy), the amendments provide relief for items within a designated group of items that are amended for changes directly required by the reform\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Group has deemed the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve to be based on the alternative benchmark rate (on which the hedge future cash flows are determined) when there is a change in basis for determining the contractual cash flows\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 in respect of whether a risk component of a hedged item is separately identifiable, the amendments provide temporary relief to entities to meet this requirement when an alternative risk free rate (RFR) financial instrument is designated as a risk component. These amendments allow the Group upon designation of the hedge to assume that the separately identifiable requirement is met if the Group reasonably expects the RFR risk will become separately identifiable within the next 24 months. The Group applies this relief to each RFR on a rate-by-rate basis and starts when the Group first designates the RFR as a non-contractually specified risk component.\n\nChanges in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nIf hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement. For items classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nThe Group's net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings. Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges; the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Group's investment in the operation.\n\n## Hedges of net investments\n\nTotal derivatives\n\n|                                                                | 2020               | 2020       | 2020            | 2019               | 2019       | 2019            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                | Notional  contract | Fair value | Fair value      | Notional  contract | Fair value | Fair value      |\n|                                                                | amount \u00a3m          | Assets  \u00a3m | Liabilities  \u00a3m | amount  \u00a3m         | Assets  \u00a3m | Liabilities  \u00a3m |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) held for trading         | 43,169,971         | 301,880    | (299,795)       | 42,111,110         | 229,063    | (228,617)       |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) held for risk management | 189,784            | 566        | (980)           | 181,375            | 173        | (587)           |\n| Derivative assets/(liabilities)                                | 43,359,755         | 302,446    | (300,775)       | 42,292,485         | 229,236    | (229,204)       |\n\nFurther information on netting arrangements of derivative financial instruments can be found within Note 18.",

        "page_content": "## 14 Derivative financial instruments continued\n\nHedge accounting is applied predominantly for the following risks:\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 interest rate risk - arises due to a mismatch between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates. Interest rate risk also includes exposure to inflation risk for certain types of investments\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 contractually linked inflation risk - arises from financial instruments within contractually specified inflation risk. The Group does not hedge inflation risk that arises from other activities.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 currency risk - arises due to assets or liabilities being denominated in different currencies than the functional currency of the relevant entity. At a consolidated level, currency risk also arises when the functional currency of subsidiaries are different from the parent\n\nIn order to hedge these risks, the Group uses the following hedging instruments:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 currency derivatives to swap foreign currency exposures into the entity's functional currency, and net investment exposure to local currency\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 interest rate derivatives to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 inflation derivatives to swap inflation exposure into either fixed or variable interest rates.\n\nIn some hedging relationships, the Group designates risk components of hedged items as follows:\n\nIn some cases, certain items which are economically hedged may be ineligible hedged items for the purposes of IAS 39, such as core deposits and equity. In these instances, a proxy hedging solution can be utilised whereby portfolios of floating rate assets are designated as eligible hedged items in cash flow hedges.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the LIBOR or Risk Free Rate (RFR) component\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 spot exchange rate risk for foreign currency financial assets or financial liabilities\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 inflation risk as a contractually specified component of a debt instrument\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 components of cash flows of hedged items, for example certain interest payments for part of the life of an instrument.\n\nIn respect of many of the Group's hedge accounting relationships, the hedged item and hedging instrument change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the risk management and hedge accounting strategy. The Group applies hedge accounting to dynamic scenarios, predominantly in relation to interest rate risk, with a combination of hedged items in order for its financial statements to reflect as closely as possible the economic risk management undertaken. In some cases, if the hedge accounting objective changes, the relevant hedge accounting relationship is de-designated and is replaced with a different hedge accounting relationship.\n\nUsing the benchmark interest rate risk results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship. LIBOR is considered the predominant interest rate risk and therefore the hedged items change in fair value on a fully proportionate basis with reference to this risk.\n\nChanges in the GBP value of net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital. The Group mitigates this by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the foreign currency RWA exposures. Net investment hedges are designated where necessary to reduce the exposure to movement in a particular exchange rate to within limits mandated by Risk. As far as possible, existing external currency liabilities are designated as the hedging instruments.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include the following:\n\nThe hedging instruments share the same risk exposures as the hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is determined with reference to quantitative tests, predominantly regression testing, but to the extent hedging instruments are exposed to different risks than the hedged items, this could result in hedge ineffectiveness or hedge accounting failures.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument, including basis differences\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 if a hedging relationship becomes over-hedged, for example in hedges of net investments if the net asset value designated at the start of the period falls below the amount of the hedging instrument\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 cash flow hedges using external swaps with non-zero fair values\n\nAcross all benchmarks which Barclays is materially exposed to, there is still uncertainty regarding the precise timing and effects of IBOR reform. There is yet to be full consensus regarding methodologies for converging existing IBORs to their final benchmark rates. As such, Barclays has not incorporated any change in assumptions for affected benchmarks into its expectations or calculations. Barclays does, however, assume sufficient liquidity in IBOR linked benchmarks to provide reliable valuation calculations of both hedged items and hedging instruments (notwithstanding reliefs already applied within the financial reporting).\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the effects of the forthcoming reforms to IBOR because these might take effect at a different time and have a different impact on hedged items and hedging instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales to establish if the business model is achieved.\n\nFinancial assets that are debt instruments held in a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling and that contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI are measured at FVOCI. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value and changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses) are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Interest (calculated using the effective interest method) is recognised in the income statement in net interest income (Note 3). Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is included in net investment income (Note 6).\n\nFor equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income (except for dividend income which is recognised in profit or loss). Gains or losses on the derecognition of these equity securities are not transferred to profit or loss. These assets are also not subject to the impairment requirements and therefore no amounts are recycled to the income statement. Where the Group has not made the irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income, equity securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n|                                                                   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Debt securities and other eligible bills                          | 77,736    | 64,103    |\n| Equity securities                                                 | 761       | 1,023     |\n| Loans and advances                                                | 191       | 624       |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 78,688    | 65,750    |\n\n## 16 Financial liabilities designated at fair value\n\n## Accounting for liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss\n\nThe details on how the fair value amounts are arrived at for financial liabilities designated at fair value are described in Note 17.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within net trading income (Note 5) and net investment income (Note 6). Movements in own credit are reported through other comprehensive income, unless the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in P&L. In these scenarios, all gains and losses on that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) are presented in P&L. On derecognition of the financial liability no amount relating to own credit risk are recycled to the income statement. The Group has the ability to make the fair value designation when holding the instruments at fair value reduces an accounting mismatch (caused by an offsetting liability or asset being held at fair value), or is managed by the Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have substantive derivative characteristics (Note 14).\n\n|                                                           | 2020           | 2020                                     | 2019           | 2019                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                                           | Fair value  \u00a3m | Contractual  amount due  on maturity  \u00a3m | Fair value  \u00a3m | Contractual  amount due  on maturity  \u00a3m |\n| Debt securities                                           | 50,437         | 57,650                                   | 49,559         | 56,891                                   |\n| Deposits                                                  | 21,706         | 22,107                                   | 25,526         | 25,725                                   |\n| Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing | 177,371        | 177,389                                  | 128,547        | 128,706                                  |\n| Other financial liabilities                               | 251            | 251                                      | 694            | 694                                      |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value            | 249,765        | 257,397                                  | 204,326        | 212,016                                  |\n\nThe cumulative own credit net loss recognised is \u00a3954m (2019: \u00a3373m loss).",

        "page_content": "## 17 Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Accounting for financial assets and liabilities - fair values\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition (including transaction costs, other than financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss) and depending on the subsequent classification of the financial asset or liability, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nFinancial instruments that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In addition, financial assets are held at fair value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the financial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling. Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are recognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch.\n\nWherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. For many of the Group's financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available and valuation models are used to estimate fair value. The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value. These models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.\n\nOn initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary. The best evidence of an instrument's fair value on initial recognition is typically the transaction price. However, if fair value can be evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or is based on a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets, then the instrument should be recognised at the fair value derived from such observable market data.\n\nFor financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes.\n\nFor valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price (Day One profit) is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction; or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate; or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.\n\nThe sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 323.\n\nVarious factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic). To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation models make use of unobservable inputs ('Level 3' assets and liabilities). This note provides information on these instruments, including the related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs, and a sensitivity analysis.\n\n## Valuation\n\n## Quoted market prices - Level 1\n\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to classify its assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below.\n\nAssets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.\n\n## Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2\n\n## Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3\n\nAssets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.",

The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models. Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.\n\nSensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations. The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of the valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.\n\nThe valuation techniques used, observability and sensitivity analysis for material products within Level 3, are described below.",

The category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nValuation: Interest rate and inflation derivatives are generally valued using curves of forward rates constructed from market data to project and discount the expected future cash flows of trades. Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market inputs, and use industry standard or bespoke models depending on the product type.\n\n## Foreign exchange derivatives\n\nObservability: In general, inputs are considered observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nDescription: Derivatives linked to the foreign exchange (FX) market. The category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options. The majority are traded as over the counter (OTC) derivatives.\n\nObservability: FX correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nValuation: FX derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models depending on the product type. Valuation inputs include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nValuation: CDS are valued on industry standard models using curves of credit spreads as the principal input. Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.\n\nDescription: Derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced assets (e.g. a securitised product). The category includes single name and index credit default swaps (CDS) and total return swaps (TRS).\n\nObservability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are actively traded are generally considered observable. Other valuation inputs are considered observable if products with significant sensitivity to the inputs are actively traded in a liquid market. Unobservable valuation inputs are generally determined with reference to recent transactions or inferred from observable trades of the same issuer or similar entities.\n\nDescription: Exchange traded or OTC derivatives linked to equity indices and single names. The category includes vanilla and exotic equity products.\n\n## Equity derivatives\n\nValuation: Equity derivatives are valued using industry standard models. Valuation inputs include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repurchase curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nObservability: In general, valuation inputs are observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nDescription: Exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and refined products, agricultural, power and natural gas.\n\nObservability: Commodity correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products, or by applying extrapolation techniques to observable inputs.\n\nValuation: Commodity swaps and options are valued using models incorporating discounting of cash flows and other industry standard modelling techniques. Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatilities implied from market observable inputs and correlations.\n\n## Corporate debt\n\nValuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing sources.\n\nDescription: Primarily corporate bonds.\n\nObservability: Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable. Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same (or a similar) issuer.\n\nDescription: Includes securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other similar secured lending agreements. The agreements are primarily short-term in nature.\n\n## Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements\n\nValuation: Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using industry standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.\n\nObservability: Inputs are deemed observable up to liquid maturities, and are determined based on the specific features of the transaction. Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.",

Unobservable loan spreads are determined by incorporating funding costs, the level of comparable assets such as gilts, issuer credit quality and other factors.\n\nDescription: Securities that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation. The category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, CDOs, collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) and other asset backed securities.\n\nProxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities' underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition (historical losses, borrower characteristics and loan attributes such as loan to value ratio and geographic concentration) and credit ratings (original and current).\n\nValuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices. Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on valuation inputs such as constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield. These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.\n\nObservability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, the instrument is considered unobservable.\n\nDescription: Includes listed equities, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and preference shares.\n\n## Equity cash products\n\nValuation: Valuation of equity cash products is primarily determined through market observable prices.\n\n## Private equity investments\n\nObservability: Prices for actively traded equity cash products are considered observable. Unobservable equity prices are generally determined by reference to actively traded instruments that are similar in nature, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nDescription: Includes investments in equity holdings in operating companies not quoted on a public exchange.\n\nObservability: Inputs are considered observable if there is active trading in a liquid market of products with significant sensitivity to the inputs. Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.\n\nValuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the 'International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines' which require the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed companies. While the valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.\n\n## Other\n\n## Assets and liabilities reclassified between Level 1 and Level 2\n\nDescription: Other includes commercial real estate loans, funds and fund-linked products, asset backed loans, physical commodities and investment property.\n\nDuring the period, there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 (2019: there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2).\n\nThe following table summarises the movements in the Level 3 balances during the period. The table shows gains and losses and includes amounts for all financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value transferred to and from Level 3 during the period. Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.\n\n## Level 3 movement analysis\n\nAsset and liability transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to i) an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an input or ii) a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an unobservable input is deemed significant.",

The range of significant unobservable credit spreads is between 17-1831bps (2019: 41-1,620bps).\n- a The units used to disclose ranges for significant unobservable inputs are percentages, points and basis points. Points are a percentage of par; for example, 100 points equals 100% of par. A basis point equals 1/100th of 1%; for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.\n- c A range has not been provided for Net Asset Value as there would be a wide range reflecting the diverse nature of the positions.\n- d  Other includes commercial real estate loans.",

Where sensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.\n\n## Forwards\n\nIn general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the contracted receiver of the underlying (currency, bond, commodity, etc.), but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nA price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.\n\n## Credit spread\n\nIn general, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in a fair value decrease for a cash asset.\n\nCredit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant demands for taking on exposure to the credit risk of an instrument and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.\n\nFor a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nVolatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in return for a given derivative underlying. It is an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument input or index will change in value over time. In general, volatilities are implied from observed option prices. For unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, and the strike/maturity profile of a specific contract.\n\n## Volatility\n\nIn general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\n## Correlation\n\nThere may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs (e.g. when equity prices fall, implied equity volatilities generally rise) but these are generally specific to individual markets and may vary over time.\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation can be a significant input into valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument. Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a CDO structure.\n\n## Comparable price\n\nA significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nComparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to establish a value.\n\n## Loan spread\n\nIn general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument. For derivatives, a change in the comparable price in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nLoan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Loan spreads typically reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.\n\nIn general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.\n\nThe ESHLA portfolio primarily consists of long-dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local Authority sectors. The loans are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation. Valuation uncertainty arises from the long-dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads. The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily regulated sectors that are considered extremely low credit risk, and have a history of near zero defaults since inception. While the overall loan spread range is from 31bps to 1,518bps (2019: 31bps to 1,884bps), the vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 97% of the loan notional being valued with spreads less than 200bps consistently for both years.\n\n## EBITDA multiple\n\nEBITDA multiple is the ratio of the valuation of the investment to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.",

Less liquid instruments may not have a directly observable bid-offer level. In such instances, an exit price adjustment may be derived from an observable bid-offer level for a comparable liquid instrument, or determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario or historical analysis.\n\nThe Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price (which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets). For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect the exit level for the expected close out strategy. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging strategy.\n\nExit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads have increased by \u00a364m to \u00a3493m as a result of movements in market bid offer spreads.\n\n## Collateralised\n\n## Discounting approaches for derivative instruments\n\nIn line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral that can be posted within the relevant credit support annex (CSA). The CSA aware discounting approach recognises the 'cheapest to deliver' option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.\n\nA fair value adjustment of \u00a3115m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not allow the rehypothecation of collateral received. This adjustment is referred to as the Funding Fair Value Adjustment (FFVA). FFVA has increased by \u00a358m to \u00a3115m as a result of moves in input funding spreads and an update to methodology.\n\n## Uncollateralised\n\nFFVA incorporates a scaling factor which is an estimate of the extent to which the cost of funding is incorporated into observed traded levels. On calibrating the scaling factor, it is with the assumption that Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustments (DVA) are retained as valuation components incorporated into such levels. The effect of incorporating this scaling factor at 31 December 2020 was to reduce FFVA by \u00a3115m (2019: \u00a3170m).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Assets and liabilities held at fair value continued\n\n## 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued\n\nCVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays' own credit quality respectively. These adjustments are calculated for uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives across all asset classes. CVA and DVA are calculated using estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, at a counterparty level. Counterparties include (but are not limited to) corporates, sovereigns and sovereign agencies and supranationals.\n\n## Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments\n\nExposure at default is generally estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors through approximating with a more vanilla structure, or by using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure.\n\nCVA increased by \u00a3133m to \u00a3268m as a result of an increased uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative asset and widening input counterparty credit spreads. DVA decreased by \u00a342m to \u00a3113m as a result of an update to methodology partially offset by widening input own credit spreads.\n\nProbability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets. Where this information is not available, or considered unreliable, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information. In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS levels would imply a \u00a332m (2019: \u00a336m) increase in CVA.\n\nCorrelation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors, termed 'wrong-way,' or 'right-way' risk, is not systematically incorporated into the CVA calculation but is adjusted where the underlying exposure is directly related to the counterparty.\n\n## Portfolio exemptions\n\nBarclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains appropriate.\n\nThe Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and liabilities. Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position (i.e. an asset) for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position (i.e. a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions. Accordingly, the Group measures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.\n\nThe amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price (the fair value at initial recognition) and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is \u00a3116m (2019: \u00a3113m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and \u00a3247m (2019: \u00a3255m) for financial instruments carried at amortised cost. There are additions of \u00a327m (2019: \u00a341m), and amortisation and releases of \u00a324m (2019: \u00a369m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and additions of \u00a36m (2019: \u00a37m) and amortisation and releases of \u00a314m (2019: \u00a314m) for financial instruments measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs\n\n## Third party credit enhancements\n\nStructured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the US. The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage. The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IFRS 9 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement. The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to \u00a31,494m (2019: \u00a33,218m).",

As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to directly compare this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions. Different valuation methodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.\n\nThe carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the relevant accounting policy in Note 19.\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Loans and advances at amortised cost\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\n\nThe fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality. Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy/extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.\n\nThe fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully collateralised.\n\nThe carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 1.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Deposits at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities, mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Consequently, the fair value discount is minimal.\n\nIn many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently, such as customer accounts and other deposits and short-term debt securities.\n\n## Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\n\n## Debt securities in issue\n\nThe fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.\n\nFair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount approximates fair value.\n\nFair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer concerned or issuers with similar terms and conditions.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Assets at amortised cost and other investments\n\nThe notes included in this section focus on the Group's loans and advances and deposits at amortised cost, leases, property, plant and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets. Details regarding the Group's liquidity and capital position can be found in the Treasury and capital risk section.\n\n## 19 Loans and advances and deposits at amortised cost\n\n## Accounting for loans and advances and deposits held at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are held in a business model to collect the contractual cash flows and that contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these financial assets at initial recognition includes any directly attributable transaction costs. Refer to Note 1 for details on 'solely payments of principal and interest'.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost. That is, the initial fair value (which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed) is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability. Balances deferred on-balance sheet as effective interest rate adjustments are amortised to interest income over the life of the financial instrument to which they relate.\n\nIn determining whether the business model is a 'hold to collect' model, the objective of the business model must be to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows rather than holding the financial asset for trading or short-term profit taking purposes. While the objective of the business model must be to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows this does not mean the Group is required to hold the financial assets until maturity. When determining if the business model objective is to collect contractual cash flows the Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales.\n\nLoans and advances and deposits at amortised cost\n\n| As at 31 December                                 | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost to banks     | 8,900     | 9,624     |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost to customers | 309,927   | 311,739   |\n| Debt securities at amortised cost                 | 23,805    | 17,752    |\n| Total loans and advances at amortised cost        | 342,632   | 339,115   |\n| Deposits at amortised cost from banks             | 17,343    | 15,402    |\n| Deposits at amortised cost from customers         | 463,693   | 400,385   |\n| Total deposits at amortised cost                  | 481,036   | 415,787   |\n\n## 20 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in enhancement of the asset.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties\n\n.\n\nDepreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances. The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation:\n\n| Annual rates in calculating depreciation                                            | Depreciation rate                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Freehold land                                                                       | Not depreciated                      |\n| Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property (more than 50 years to run)          | 2-3.3%                               |\n| Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease (less than 50 years to run) | Over the remaining life of the lease |\n| Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property                              | 6-10%                                |\n| Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property                              | 6-10%                                |\n| Computers and similar equipment                                                     | 17-33%                               |\n| Fixtures and fittings and other equipment                                           | 9-20%                                |\n\nCosts of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the lease or the depreciation rates noted in the table above.\n\nThe Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date, reflecting market conditions at the reporting date.

IFRS 16 includes an accounting policy choice for a lessee to elect not to apply IFRS 16 to remaining assets within the scope of IAS 38 Intangible Assets which the Group has decided to apply.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a lease liability, measured at the present value of remaining cash flows on the lease, and\n\nSubsequently the lease liability will increase for the accrual of interest, resulting in a constant rate of return throughout the life of the lease, and reduce when payments are made. The right of use asset will amortise to the income statement over the life of the lease. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in one of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 a right of use (ROU) asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made prior to commencement date, initial direct costs, and estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lease, less any lease incentives received.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Group's assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU asset, or is recorded in the income statement if the carrying amount of the ROU asset has been reduced to nil.\n\nThe Group applies the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months. For these leases the lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the ROU assets are included within property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities are included within other liabilities.\n\nWhen the Group is the lessor, the lease must be classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee. An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased asset remain with the lessor.\n\nWhen the lease is deemed an operating lease, the lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate. The Group holds the leased assets on-balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.\n\nWhen the lease is deemed a finance lease, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet; instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.\n\n## Accounting for finance leases under IAS 17 for 2018\n\nInterest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.\n\nUnder IAS 17, a finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee. Where the Group is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet; instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.

The portfolio of short term leases to which Barclays is exposed at the end of the year is not dissimilar to the expenses recognised in the year.\n\n| Lease liabilities               |         |         |\n|---------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                 | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n| As at 1 January                 | 1,563   | 1,696   |\n| Interest expense                | 70      | 76      |\n| New leases                      | 85      | 94      |\n| Disposals                       | (15)    | (19)    |\n| Cash payments                   | (306)   | (289)   |\n| Exchange and other movements    | 47      | 5       |\n| As at 31 December (see Note 23) | 1,444   | 1,563   |",

The above gross cash flows have been reduced by \u00a3446m (2019: \u00a3474m) for leases where Barclays is highly expected to exercise an early termination option. However, there is no significant impact where Barclays is expected to exercise an extension option.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 variable lease payments: This variability will typically arise from either inflation index instruments or market based pricing adjustments. Currently, Barclays has 809 (2019: 939) leases out of the total 1,329 (2019: 1,467) leases which have variable lease payment terms based on market based pricing adjustments. Of the gross cash flows identified above, \u00a31,096m (2019: \u00a31,526m) is attributable to leases with some degree of variability predominately linked to market based pricing adjustments\n\nThe Group currently does not have any significant sale and lease back transactions. The Group does not have any restrictions or covenants imposed by the lessor on its property leases which restrict its businesses.",

The test involves comparing the carrying value of a cash generating unit (CGU) including goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGU's fair value if this is higher.\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets\n\n.\n\nFor internally generated intangible assets, only costs incurred during the development phase are capitalised. Expenditures in the research phase are expensed when it is incurred.\n\nIntangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost (which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below:\n\n| Annual rates in calculating amortisation   | Amortisation period   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Goodwill                                   | Not amortised         |\n| Internally generated software a            | 12 months to 6 years  |\n| Other software                             | 12 months to 6 years  |\n| Customer lists                             | 12 months to 25 years |\n| Licences and other                         | 12 months to 25 years |\n\n## Note\n\n- a Exceptions to the above rate relate to useful lives of certain core banking platforms that are assessed individually and, if appropriate, amortised over longer periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.\n\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.

Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The review of goodwill for impairment involves calculating a value in use (VIU) valuation which is compared to the carrying value of a CGU associated with the goodwill to determine whether any impairment has occurred. This includes the identification of independent CGUs across the organisation and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The cash flow forecasts used by management involve judgement and are based upon a view of the future prospects of the business and market conditions at the point in time the assessment is prepared. The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term sustainable cash flows.\n\nThe calculation of a value in use contains a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the future cash flows and the rates used to discount them. Key judgements include determining the carrying value of the CGU, the cash flows and discount rates used in the calculation.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The discount rates applied to the future cash flows also involve judgement as they can have a significant impact on the valuation. The discount rates used are compared to market participants to ensure that they are appropriate and based on an estimated cost of equity for each CGU.\n\nFurther details of some of the key judgements are set out below.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The choice of a terminal growth rate used to determine the present value of the future cash flows of the CGUs is also a judgement that can impact the outcome of the assessment. The terminal growth rate and discount rates used may vary due to external market rates and economic conditions that are beyond management's control.\n\n## 2020 impairment review\n\n## Determining the carrying value of CGUs\n\nThe 2020 impairment review was performed during Q4 2020. Given the change in the macroeconomic and interest rate outlook, this review was performed across all material CGUs. The review identified that a number of the CGUs have been adversely impacted by changes in their operating environment, in particular retail and business banking activity. A detailed assessment has been performed, with the approach and results of this analysis set out below.\n\nThe carrying value for each CGU is the sum of the tangible equity, goodwill and intangible balances associated with that CGU.\n\nThe goodwill held across the group has been allocated to the CGU where it originated, based upon historical records. The intangible balances are allocated to the CGUs based upon their expected usage of these assets.\n\nThe Group manages the assets and liabilities of its CGUs with reference to tangible equity of the respective businesses. That tangible equity is derived from the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU and therefore reflects its relative risk, as well as the level of capital management consider a market participant would require to hold and retain to support business growth.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nAs required by IAS 36, all estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives where a constructive obligation to carry out the plan does not yet exist.\n\nThe five-year cash flows used in the calculation are based on the formally agreed medium term plans approved by the Board. These are prepared using macroeconomic assumptions which management consider reasonable and supportable, and reflect business agreed initiatives for the forecast period. The macroeconomic assumptions underpinning the medium term plan were determined in August 2020 and management has considered whether there are subsequent significant changes in those assumptions which would adversely impact the results of the impairment review.\n\nThe Education, Social Housing and Local Authority (ESHLA) portfolio has been excluded from the Business Banking CGU cash flows. This is a legacy loan portfolio which was previously within the Non-Core bank and was not part of the business to which the goodwill relates. As such, the cash flows relating to this portfolio have been excluded from the Business Banking VIU calculation.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe Personal Banking CGU cash flows have been extended to a sixth year (prior to the calculation of terminal values below) to reflect an observed 15bp inflexion point in the yield curve which was beyond the period of the medium term plan.\n\nIAS 36 requires that the discount rate used in a value in use calculation reflects the pre-tax rate an investor would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate similar cash flows to those that the entity expects to generate from the asset. In determining the discount rate, management have identified the cost of equity associated with market participants that closely resemble our cash generating units and adjusted them for tax to arrive at the pre-tax equivalent rate. A range of discount rates have been used across the CGUs ranging from 12.0% to 16.3% (2019: 11.0% to 13.3%).\n\nThe terminal growth rate is used to estimate the effect of projecting cash flows to the end of an asset's useful economic life. It is management's judgement that the cash flows associated with the CGUs will grow in line with the major economies in which we operate. In prior years, the growth rate used had been based upon estimated economic growth rates (GDP). Given macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation rates are now considered a better approximation of future growth rates and are therefore the basis of terminal growth rates applied. The terminal growth rate used is 2.0% (2019:1.5%).\n\n## Terminal growth rate",

Interest rate assumptions impact planned cash flows from both customer income and structural hedge contributions and therefore cash flow expectations are highly sensitive to movements in the yield curve. The cash flows also contain assumptions with regards to the prudential and financial conduct regulatory environment which may be subject to change. Given the current level of economic uncertainty, a 10% reduction in cash flows has been provided to show the sensitivity of the outcome to a change in these key assumptions.\n\nTerminal growth rate: The terminal growth rate is used to estimate the cash flows into perpetuity based on the expected longevity of the CGU's businesses. The terminal growth rate is sensitive to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The risk that using inflation data may not be appropriate for its determination is quantified below and shows the impact of a 100 bps change in the terminal value.\n\nDiscount rate: The discount rate should reflect the market risk free rate adjusted for the inherent risks of the business it is applied to. Management have identified discount rates for comparable businesses and consider these to be a reasonable estimate of a suitable market rate for the profile of the business unit being tested. The risk that these discount rates may not be appropriate is quantified below and show the impact of a 100 bps change in the discount rate.\n\nAllocated capital rate: Tangible equity is allocated based on the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU which is dependent on the relative risk of businesses. The capital ratio used in determining the level of tangible equity allocated to the CGU and its capital cash flows could move over time. The impact of a 50 bps increase in capital ratio is quantified below.\n\nThe sensitivity of the value in use to key judgements in the calculations is set out below:\n\n|                      |                    |                                                                    |                  |                          |                                              |                                                                       |                                                 |                                              | Change required to reduce   headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce   headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce   headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce   headroom to zero   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash generating unit | Carrying  value \u00a3m | Value in  use \u00a3m Value in use  exceeding  carrying  value \u00a3m 8,932 | Discount  rate % | Terminal  growth  rate % | 100 bps  increase  in the  discount  rate \u00a3m | Reduction in headroom 100 bps  decrease  in terminal  growth  rate \u00a3m | 50 bps  increase to  allocated  capital rate \u00a3m | 10%  reduction in  forecasted  cash flows \u00a3m | Discount  rate %                               | Terminal  growth  rate %                       | Allocated  capital  rate %                     | Cash  flows %                                  |\n| Personal Banking     | 8,809              | 123                                                                | 13.51            | 2.0                      | (893)                                        | (623)                                                                 | (220)                                           | (972)                                        | 0.1                                            | (0.2)                                          | 0.3                                            | (1.3)                                          |\n| Business Banking     | 2,172 2,912        | 740                                                                | 13.81            | 2.0                      | (205)                                        | (128)                                                                 | (60)                                            | (206)                                        | 4.6                                            | (9.7)                                          | 6.2                                            | (35.9)                                         |\n| Total                | 10,981 11,844      | 863                                                                |                  |                          |                                              |                                                                       |                                                 |                                              |                                                |                                                |                                                |                                                |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis highlights that there could be an impairment in the recoverable value of the goodwill associated with Personal Banking if there were to be a change in management cash flow forecasts, discount rate or allocated capital rate.

Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.\n\n## 23 Other liabilities\n\n|                                                      | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Accruals and deferred income                         | 3,683     | 3,472     |\n| Other creditors                                      | 3,447     | 3,257     |\n| Items in the course of collection due to other banks | 88        | 213       |\n| Lease liabilities (refer to Note 21)                 | 1,444     | 1,563     |\n| Other liabilities                                    | 8,662     | 8,505     |\n\n## 24 Provisions\n\n## Accounting for provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated. Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs, when an obligation exists; for example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets in accounting for non-financial liabilities.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe complexity of such matters often requires the input of specialist professional advice in making assessments to produce estimates. Customer redress and legal, competition and regulatory matters are areas where a higher degree of professional judgement is required. The amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it. This gives rise to a large range of potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level. See below for information on payment protection redress and Note 26 for more detail of legal, competition and regulatory matters.\n\nThe financial reporting of provisions involves a significant degree of judgement and is complex. Identifying whether a present obligation exists and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements to be made based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice. When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty involved. Management continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, however there can remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition and regulatory matters, and as a result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more advanced stage.\n\n|                              |                        |                                    |                                                                    | Customer redress                | Customer redress            |                                                  |                      |           |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|\n|                              | Onerous  contracts  \u00a3m | Redundancy  and  restructuring  \u00a3m | Undrawn  contractually  committed  facilities and  guarantees\u00aa  \u00a3m | Payment Protection Insurance \u00a3m | Other customer  redress  \u00a3m | Legal,  competition  and regulatory  matters  \u00a3m | Sundry provisions \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m |\n| As at 1 January 2020         | 42                     | 143                                | 322                                                                | 1,155                           | 420                         | 376                                              | 306                  | 2,764     |\n| Additions                    | 24                     | 194                                | 806                                                                | -                               | 186                         | 106                                              | 192                  | 1,508     |\n| Amounts utilised             | (13)                   | (109)                              | -                                                                  | (979)                           | (195)                       | (171)                                            | (118)                | (1,585)   |\n| Unused amounts reversed      | (25)                   | (60)                               | (30)                                                               | (47)                            | (44)                        | (45)                                             | (92)                 | (343)     |\n| Exchange and other movements | -                      | (10)                               | (34)                                                               | -                               | 1                           | 2                                                | 1                    | (40)      |\n| As at 31 December 2020       | 28                     | 158                                | 1,064                                                              | 129                             | 368                         | 268                                              | 289                  | 2,304     |\n\n## Note\n\n- a Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees provisions are accounted for under IFRS 9.\n\nProvisions expected to be recovered or settled within no more than 12 months after 31 December 2020 were \u00a31,751m (2019: \u00a32,457m).\n\nOnerous contract provisions comprise an estimate of the costs involved with fulfilling the terms and conditions of contracts net of any expected benefits to be received.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\n## Redundancy and restructuring\n\nThese provisions comprise the estimated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs where an obligation exists.

        "page_content": "## 24 Provisions continued\n\nImpairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately. Any excess is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For wholesale portfolios, the impairment allowance on the undrawn exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For further information, refer to the Credit risk section for loan commitments and financial guarantees on page 176.\n\n## Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees\n\n## Customer redress\n\n## Legal, competition and regulatory matters\n\nCustomer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of the Group's business activities. Other than Payment Protection Insurance, there are no significant individual customer redress provisions at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US. For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 26.\n\nThis category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.\n\n## Sundry provisions\n\n## Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) redress\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 Barclays had recognised cumulative provisions totalling \u00a310.9bn (December 2019: \u00a311bn), including a \u00a355m release in Q4 2020 on resolution of the items received in Q3 2019 and claims from the Official Receiver with whom we reached agreement in Q3 2020, against the cost of PPI redress and associated processing costs. Utilisation of the cumulative provisions to date is \u00a310.8bn (December 2019: \u00a39.8bn), leaving a residual provision of \u00a30.1bn (December 2019: \u00a31.2bn) to be utilised in 2021. This represents Barclays best estimate as at 31 December 2020 based on information available.\n\n## 25 Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\n## Accounting for contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is remote.\n\nThe following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on-balance sheet:\n\n|                                                                     | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security     | 15,665    | 17,606    |\n| Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements                | 5,944     | 6,921     |\n| Total contingent liabilities                                        | 21,609    | 24,527    |\n| Of which: Financial guarantees carried at fair value                | 229       | 43        |\n| Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions | 1,086     | 1,291     |\n| Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments              | 331,963   | 333,164   |\n| Total commitments                                                   | 333,049   | 334,455   |\n| Of which: Loan commitments carried at fair value                    | 9,269     | 17,679    |\n\nExpected credit losses held against contingent liabilities and commitments equal \u00a31,064m (2019: \u00a3322m) and are reported in Note 24. Further details on contingent liabilities relating to legal and competition and regulatory matters can be found in Note 26.\n\n## 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters\n\nThe recognition of provisions in relation to such matters involves critical accounting estimates and judgements in accordance with the relevant accounting policies as described in Note 24, Provisions. We have not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial impact or effect on the Group of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so. Various matters detailed in this note seek damages of an unspecified amount. While certain matters specify the damages claimed, such claimed amounts do not necessarily reflect the Group's potential financial exposure in respect of those matters.\n\nThe Group faces legal, competition and regulatory challenges, many of which are beyond our control. The extent of the impact of these matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects. Matters arising from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nMatters are ordered under headings corresponding to the financial statements in which they are disclosed.",

Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC\n\n## FCA proceedings\n\n## Civil action\n\nIn 2008, Barclays Bank PLC and Qatar Holdings LLC entered into two advisory service agreements (the Agreements). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into whether the Agreements may have related to Barclays PLC's capital raisings in June and November 2008 (the Capital Raisings) and therefore should have been disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the Capital Raisings. In 2013, the FCA issued warning notices (the Notices) finding that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly and in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules, and that Barclays PLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3. The financial penalty provided in the Notices is \u00a350m. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC continue to contest the findings. Following the conclusion of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) proceedings against certain former Barclays executives resulting in their acquittals, the FCA proceedings, which were stayed, have resumed. All charges brought by the SFO against Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC in relation to the Agreements were dismissed in 2018.\n\nPCP Capital Partners LLP and PCP International Finance Limited (PCP) are seeking damages of up to approximately \u00a3819m from Barclays Bank PLC for fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit, arising from alleged statements made by Barclays Bank PLC to PCP in relation to the terms on which securities were to be issued to potential investors, allegedly including PCP, in the November 2008 capital raising. The trial took place in 2020 and the High Court has indicated that judgment is imminent. The outcome of the judgment, and any financial impact on the Group, is unknown. Barclays Bank PLC is defending the claim.\n\nRegulators and law enforcement agencies, including certain competition authorities, from a number of governments have conducted investigations relating to Barclays Bank PLC's involvement in allegedly manipulating certain financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR. The SFO closed its investigation with no action to be taken against the Group. Various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR and/or other benchmarks.\n\n## Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks and related civil actions\n\n## USD LIBOR civil actions\n\nPutative class actions and individual actions seek unspecified damages with the exception of three lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs are seeking a combined total of approximately $900m in actual damages and additional punitive damages against all defendants, including Barclays Bank PLC. Some of the lawsuits also seek trebling of damages under the Antitrust Act and RICO. Barclays Bank PLC has previously settled certain claims. Two class action settlements where Barclays Bank PLC has respectively paid $7.1m and $20m have received final court approval.\n\nThe majority of the USD LIBOR cases, which have been filed in various US jurisdictions, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the US District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The complaints are substantially similar and allege, among other things, that Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. (BCI) and other financial institutions individually and collectively violated provisions of the US Sherman Antitrust Act (Antitrust Act), the US Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various state laws by manipulating USD LIBOR rates.\n\n## Sterling LIBOR civil actions\n\n## Japanese Yen LIBOR civil actions\n\nIn 2016, two putative class actions filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other Sterling LIBOR panel banks alleging, among other things, that the defendants manipulated the Sterling LIBOR rate in violation of the Antitrust Act, CEA and RICO, were consolidated. The defendants' motion to dismiss the claims was granted in 2018. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.\n\nIn 2012, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and other Japanese Yen LIBOR panel banks by a lead plaintiff involved in exchange-traded derivatives and members of the Japanese Bankers Association's Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (Euroyen TIBOR) panel. The complaint alleges, among other things, manipulation of the Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR rates and breaches of the CEA and the Antitrust Act. In 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiff's antitrust claims, and, in 2020, the court dismissed the plaintiff's remaining CEA claims. The plaintiff has appealed the lower court's dismissal of such claims.\n\n## SIBOR/SOR civil action\n\nIn 2015, a second putative class action, making similar allegations to the above class action, was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in 2020, and the defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.\n\nIn 2016, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants, alleging manipulation of the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). In 2018, the court dismissed all claims against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.\n\nIn 2019, several putative class actions were filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, other financial institution defendants and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and certain of its affiliates (ICE), asserting antitrust claims that defendants manipulated USD LIBOR through defendants' submissions to ICE. These actions have been consolidated. The defendants' motion to dismiss was granted in 2020. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. In August 2020, an ICE LIBOR-related action was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of individual borrowers and consumers of loans and credit cards with variable interest rates linked to USD ICE LIBOR.\n\n## ICE LIBOR civil actions\n\n## Non-US benchmarks civil actions\n\nLegal proceedings (which include the claims referred to below in 'Local authority civil actions concerning LIBOR') have been brought or threatened against Barclays Bank PLC (and, in certain cases, Barclays Bank UK PLC) in the UK in connection with alleged manipulation of LIBOR, EURIBOR and other benchmarks. Proceedings have also been brought in a number of other jurisdictions in Europe and Israel. Additional proceedings in other jurisdictions may be brought in the future.",

        "page_content": "## 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued\n\nIn 2015, the Group reached settlements totalling approximately $2.38bn with various US federal and state authorities and the FCA in relation to investigations into certain sales and trading practices in the Foreign Exchange market. Under the related plea agreement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which received final court approval in January 2017, the Group agreed to a term of probation of three years, which expired in January 2020. The Group also continues to provide relevant information to certain authorities.\n\n## Foreign Exchange investigations and related civil actions\n\nThe European Commission is one of a number of authorities still conducting an investigation into certain trading practices in Foreign Exchange markets. The European Commission announced two settlements in May 2019 and the Group paid penalties totalling approximately \u20ac210m. In June 2019, the Swiss Competition Commission announced two settlements and the Group paid penalties totalling approximately CHF 27m. The financial impact of the ongoing matters is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## FX opt out civil action\n\nVarious individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets.\n\nIn 2018, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI settled a consolidated action filed in the SDNY, alleging manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets (Consolidated FX Action), for a total amount of $384m. Also in 2018, a group of plaintiffs who opted out of the Consolidated FX Action filed a complaint in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants. Some of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, a putative class action was filed against several international banks, including Barclays PLC and BCI, on behalf of a proposed class of individuals who exchanged currencies on a retail basis at bank branches (Retail Basis Claims). The SDNY has ruled that the Retail Basis Claims are not covered by the settlement agreement in the Consolidated FX Action. The Court subsequently dismissed all Retail Basis Claims against the Group and all other defendants. The plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint.\n\n## Retail basis civil action\n\n## State law FX civil action\n\n## Non-US FX civil actions\n\nIn 2017, the SDNY dismissed consolidated putative class actions brought under federal and various state laws on behalf of proposed classes of (i) stockholders of Exchange Traded Funds and others who purportedly were indirect investors in FX instruments, and (ii) investors who traded FX instruments through FX dealers or brokers not alleged to have manipulated Foreign Exchange Rates. Barclays Bank PLC and BCI have settled the claim, which has received final court approval. The financial impact of the settlement is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\nLegal proceedings have been brought or are threatened against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and Barclays Execution Services Limited (BX) in connection with alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange in the UK, a number of other jurisdictions in Europe, Israel and Australia and additional proceedings may be brought in the future.\n\n## Metals investigations and related civil actions\n\nThese include two purported class actions filed against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BX, BCI and other financial institutions in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal in 2019 following the settlements with the European Commission described above. Also in 2019, a separate claim was filed in the UK in the High Court of Justice by various banks and asset management firms against Barclays Bank PLC and other financial institutions alleging breaches of European and UK competition laws related to FX trading.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC previously provided information to the DoJ, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other authorities in connection with investigations into metals and metals-based financial instruments.\n\nCivil actions have also been filed in Canadian courts against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Canada Inc. and BCI on behalf of proposed classes of plaintiffs alleging manipulation of gold and silver prices.\n\nA number of US civil complaints, each on behalf of a proposed class of plaintiffs, have been consolidated and transferred to the SDNY. The complaints allege that Barclays Bank PLC and other members of The London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. manipulated the prices of gold and gold derivative contracts in violation of the Antitrust Act and other federal laws. This consolidated putative class action remains pending. A separate US civil complaint by a proposed class of plaintiffs against a number of banks, including Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and BX, alleging manipulation of the price of silver in violation of the CEA, the Antitrust Act and state antitrust and consumer protection laws, has been dismissed as against the Barclays entities. The plaintiffs have the option to seek the court's permission to appeal.\n\n## US residential mortgage related civil actions\n\nThese repurchase actions are ongoing. In one repurchase action, the New York Court of Appeals held that claims related to certain R&Ws are timebarred. Barclays Bank PLC has reached a settlement to resolve two of the repurchase actions, which is subject to final court approval. The financial impact of the settlement is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position. The remaining two repurchase actions are pending.\n\nThere are various pending civil actions relating to US Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS), including four actions arising from unresolved repurchase requests submitted by Trustees for certain RMBS, alleging breaches of various loan-level representations and warranties (R&Ws) made by Barclays Bank PLC and/or a subsidiary acquired in 2007 (the Acquired Subsidiary). The unresolved repurchase requests had an original principal balance of approximately $2.1bn. The Trustees have also alleged that the relevant R&Ws may have been breached with respect to a greater (but unspecified) amount of loans than previously stated in the unresolved repurchase requests.",

As to BCI, the complaint alleges that the funds purchased approximately $22m in RMBS underwritten by BCI. The plaintiffs have asserted claims under New Mexico state law, which provides for the ability to claim treble damages and civil penalties.\n\nCertain governmental authorities have conducted investigations into activities relating to the trading of certain government and agency securities in various markets. The Group provided information in cooperation with such investigations. In January 2021, the Mexican Competition Authority concluded its investigation into activities relating to the trading of Mexican government bonds and granted Barclays Bank Mexico S.A. immunity from fines.\n\n## Treasury auction securities civil actions\n\nCivil actions have also been filed on the basis of similar allegations, as described below.\n\nConsolidated putative class action complaints filed in US federal court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other financial institutions under the Antitrust Act and state common law allege that the defendants (i) conspired to manipulate the US Treasury securities market and/or (ii) conspired to prevent the creation of certain platforms by boycotting or threatening to boycott such trading platforms. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.\n\n## Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds civil actions\n\nIn addition, certain plaintiffs have filed a related, direct action against BCI and certain other financial institutions, alleging that defendants conspired to fix and manipulate the US Treasury securities market in violation of the Antitrust Act, the CEA and state common law.\n\nCivil antitrust actions have been filed in the SDNY and Federal Court of Canada in Toronto against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, BX, Barclays Capital Securities Limited and, with respect to the civil action filed in Canada only, Barclays Capital Canada, Inc. and other financial institutions alleging that the defendants conspired to fix prices and restrain competition in the market for US dollar-denominated Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds.\n\n## Variable Rate Demand Obligations civil actions\n\nIn one of the actions filed in the SDNY, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint, which the plaintiffs have appealed. The plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed the other SDNY action.\n\nCivil actions have been filed against Barclays Bank PLC and BCI and other financial institutions alleging the defendants conspired or colluded to artificially inflate interest rates set for Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDOs). VRDOs are municipal bonds with interest rates that reset on a periodic basis, most commonly weekly. Two actions in state court have been filed by private plaintiffs on behalf of the states of Illinois and California. Two putative class action complaints, which have been consolidated, have been filed in the SDNY. In the SDNY class action, certain of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed in November 2020.\n\nIn a putative class action filed in the SDNY in 2019, plaintiffs alleged that BCI and certain other bond dealers conspired to fix the prices of US government sponsored entity bonds in violation of US antitrust law. BCI agreed to a settlement of $87m, which received final court approval in 2020. Separately, various entities in Louisiana, including the Louisiana Attorney General and the City of Baton Rouge, have commenced litigation against Barclays Bank PLC and other financial institutions making similar allegations as the SDNY class action plaintiffs.\n\n## Government bond civil actions\n\nIn 2018, a separate putative class action against various financial institutions including Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, Barclays Bank Mexico, S.A., and certain other subsidiaries of the Group was consolidated in the SDNY. The plaintiffs asserted antitrust and state law claims arising out of an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of Mexican Government bonds. Barclays PLC has settled the claim for $5.7m, which is subject to final court approval.\n\nIn 2020, BCI, together with other financial institutions, were named as defendants in a putative class action. The complaint alleges a conspiracy to boycott developing electronic trading platforms for odd-lots and price fixing. Plaintiffs demand unspecified money damages. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.\n\n## Odd-lot corporate bonds antitrust class action\n\n## Interest rate swap and credit default swap US civil actions\n\nIn 2018, trueEX LLC filed an antitrust class action in the SDNY against a number of financial institutions including Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI based on similar allegations with respect to trueEX LLC's development of an IRS platform. In 2017, Tera Group Inc. filed a separate civil antitrust action in the SDNY claiming that certain conduct alleged in the IRS cases also caused the plaintiff to suffer harm with respect to the Credit Default Swaps market. In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the court dismissed certain claims in both cases for unjust enrichment and tortious interference but denied motions to dismiss the federal and state antitrust claims, which remain pending.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI, together with other financial institutions that act as market makers for interest rate swaps (IRS) are named as defendants in several antitrust class actions which were consolidated in the SDNY in 2016. The complaints allege the defendants conspired to prevent the development of exchanges for IRS and demand unspecified money damages.\n\n## BDC Finance L.L.C.\n\nIn 2011, BDC's investment advisor, BDCM Fund Adviser, L.L.C. and its parent company, Black Diamond Capital Holdings, L.L.C. also sued Barclays Bank PLC and BCI in Connecticut State Court for unspecified damages allegedly resulting from Barclays Bank PLC's conduct relating to the Agreement, asserting claims for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and tortious interference with business and prospective business relations. This case is currently stayed.\n\nIn 2008, BDC Finance L.L.C. (BDC) filed a complaint in the NY Supreme Court, demanding damages of $298m, alleging that Barclays Bank PLC had breached a contract in connection with a portfolio of total return swaps governed by an ISDA Master Agreement (collectively, the Agreement). Following a trial, the court ruled in 2018 that Barclays Bank PLC was not a defaulting party, which was affirmed on appeal. In October 2020, the trial court granted Barclays Bank PLC's motion for summary judgment on its counterclaims against BDC. BDC has appealed.",

        "page_content": "## 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued\n\nThere are a number of civil actions, on behalf of more than 4,000 plaintiffs, filed in US federal courts in the US District Court in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) and SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and a number of other banks. The complaints generally allege that Barclays Bank PLC and those banks engaged in a conspiracy to facilitate US dollar-denominated transactions for the Government of Iran and various Iranian banks, which in turn funded acts of terrorism that injured or killed plaintiffs or plaintiffs' family members. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages for pain, suffering and mental anguish under the provisions of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which allow for the trebling of any proven damages.\n\n## Civil actions in respect of the US Anti-Terrorism Act\n\nThe court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss three actions in the EDNY. Plaintiffs have appealed in one action. The court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss another action in the SDNY. The remaining actions are stayed pending decisions in these cases.\n\nA purported Barclays shareholder filed a putative derivative action in New York state court against BCI and a number of current and former members of the Board of Directors of Barclays PLC and senior executives or employees of the Group. The shareholder filed the claim on behalf of Barclays PLC, alleging that the individual defendants harmed the company through breaches of their duties under the Companies Act 2006. The plaintiff seeks damages for the losses that Barclays PLC allegedly suffered.\n\n## Shareholder derivative action\n\n## 2.  Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC\n\nSince 2018, the FCA has been investigating whether the Group implemented effective systems and controls with respect to collections and recoveries and whether it paid due consideration to the interests of customers in default and arrears. In December 2020, Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Bank PLC settled with the FCA and agreed to pay a total penalty of \u00a326m.\n\n## Investigation into collections and recoveries relating to unsecured lending\n\n## Investigation into UK cards' affordability\n\n## HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) assessments concerning UK Value Added Tax\n\nThe FCA is investigating certain aspects of the affordability assessment process used by Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Bank PLC for credit card applications made to Barclays' UK credit card business. Barclays is providing information in cooperation with the investigation.\n\nIn 2018, HMRC issued notices that have the effect of removing certain overseas subsidiaries that have operations in the UK from Barclays' UK VAT group, in which group supplies between members are generally free from VAT. The notices have retrospective effect and correspond to assessments of \u00a3181m (inclusive of interest), of which Barclays would expect to attribute an amount of approximately \u00a3128m to Barclays Bank UK PLC and \u00a353m to Barclays Bank PLC. HMRC's decision has been appealed to the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber).\n\nFollowing settlement by Barclays Bank PLC of various governmental investigations concerning certain benchmark interest rate submissions referred to above in 'Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks and related civil actions', in the UK, certain local authorities have brought claims against Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC asserting that they entered into loans in reliance on misrepresentations made by Barclays Bank PLC in respect of its conduct in relation to LIBOR. Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC have applied to strike out the claims.\n\n## Local authority civil actions concerning LIBOR\n\n## 3.  Barclays PLC\n\nBarclays PLC has been named as a defendant in a claim brought in the UK in the High Court of Justice by various shareholders regarding Barclays PLC's share price based on the allegations contained within a complaint by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) in 2014. The NYAG complaint was filed against Barclays PLC and BCI in the Supreme Court of the State of New York alleging, among other things, that Barclays PLC and BCI engaged in fraud and deceptive practices in connection with LX, BCI's SEC-registered alternative trading system. Such claim was settled in 2016, as previously disclosed. This new shareholder claim is seeking unquantified damages, although Barclays PLC has not yet been served.\n\n## Alternative trading systems\n\n## General\n\nThe Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged. The Group is cooperating with the relevant authorities and keeping all relevant agencies briefed as appropriate in relation to these matters and others described in this note on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters in the UK, the US and a number of other overseas jurisdictions. It is subject to legal proceedings brought by and against the Group which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data management and protection, intellectual property, money laundering, financial crime, employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.\n\nAt the present time, Barclays PLC does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters (including formerly active matters or those matters arising after the date of this note) will not be material to Barclays PLC's results, operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of profit otherwise reported for the reporting period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The principal terms of the undated subordinated liabilities are described below:\n\n## Undated subordinated liabilities\n\n## Subordination\n\n## Interest\n\nAll undated subordinated liabilities rank behind the claims against the bank of depositors and other unsecured unsubordinated creditors and holders of dated subordinated liabilities in the following order: Junior Undated Floating Rate Notes; followed by TONs and RCIs ranking pari passu with each other.\n\nThe Junior Undated Notes are floating rate notes where rates are fixed periodically in advance based on the related market rate.\n\n## Payment of interest\n\nThe TONs and RCIs bear a fixed rate of interest until the initial call date. After the initial call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the TONs and RCIs will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\nNo payment of principal or any interest may be made in relation to the TONs and RCIs unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the TONs if it determines that it is, or such payment would result in it being, in noncompliance with capital adequacy requirements and policies of the PRA. Any such deferred payment of interest will only be payable on a redemption of the TONs. Until such time as Barclays Bank PLC next makes a payment of interest on the TONs, (i) neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of their respective ordinary shares or preference shares, or make payments of interest in respect of Barclays Bank PLC's Reserve Capital Instruments and (ii) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the RCIs. Any such deferred payment of interest must be paid on the earlier of: (i) the date of redemption of the RCIs, and (ii) the coupon payment date falling on or nearest to the tenth anniversary of the date of deferral of such payment. Whilst such deferral is continuing, (i) neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of its ordinary shares or preference shares and (ii) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.\n\n## Repayment\n\n## Other\n\nAll undated subordinated liabilities are repayable at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, generally in whole, at the initial call date and on any subsequent coupon or interest payment date. In addition, each issue of undated subordinated liabilities is repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC in whole for certain tax reasons, either at any time, or on an interest payment date. There are no events of default except non-payment of principal or mandatory interest. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA.\n\nAll issues of undated subordinated liabilities are non-convertible.",

The principal terms of the dated subordinated liabilities are described below:\n\n## Dated subordinated liabilities\n\n## Subordination\n\nAll dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by Barclays Bank PLC rank behind the claims against the bank of depositors and other unsecured unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the undated subordinated liabilities and the holders of its equity. The dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by other subsidiaries are similarly subordinated as the external subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays Bank PLC.\n\nDated subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays PLC ranks behind the claims against Barclays PLC of unsecured unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the holders of its equity.\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest on Fixed Rate Notes is set by reference to market rates at the time of issuance and fixed until maturity.\n\nInterest on the Floating Rate Notes is fixed periodically in advance, based on the related market rates.\n\nInterest on the 4.836% Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes, 2% Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes 3.75% SGD Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, 3.75% GBP Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes and the 3.564% Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes are fixed until the call date. After the respective call dates, in the event that they are not redeemed, the interest rates will be reset and fixed until maturity based on a market rate. Interest on the 5.088% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Callable Notes are fixed until the call date. After the call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the interest rate will reset periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\nThose subordinated liabilities with a call date are repayable at the option of the issuer, on conditions governing the respective debt obligations, some in whole or in part, and some only in whole. The remaining dated subordinated liabilities outstanding at 31 December 2020 are redeemable only on maturity, subject in particular cases to provisions allowing an early redemption in the event of certain changes in tax law, or to certain changes in legislation or regulations.\n\n## Repayment\n\nAny repayments prior to maturity require, in the case of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, the prior consent of the PRA, or in the case of the overseas issues, the approval of the local regulator for that jurisdiction and of the PRA in certain circumstances.\n\n## Other\n\nThere are no committed facilities in existence at the balance sheet date which permit the refinancing of debt beyond the date of maturity.\n\nThe 7.625% Contingent Capital Notes will be automatically transferred from investors to Barclays PLC (or another entity within the Group) for nil consideration in the event the Barclays PLC transitional CET1 ratio falls below 7%.\n\n## 28 Ordinary shares, share premium, and other equity\n\n## Called up share capital, allotted and fully paid\n\n|                                                | Number  of shares m   | Ordinary  share capital \u00a3m   | Ordinary  share  premium \u00a3m   | Total share  capital  and share  premium  \u00a3m   | Other equity  instruments \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| As at 1 January 2020                           | 17,322                | 4,331                        | 263                           | 4,594                                          | 10,871                         |\n| Issued to staff under share incentive plans    | 37                    | 9                            | 34                            | 43                                             | -                              |\n| AT1 securities issuance                        | -                     | -                            | -                             | -                                              | 1,142                          |\n| AT1 securities redemption                      | -                     | -                            | -                             | -                                              | (831)                          |\n| Other movements                                | -                     | -                            | -                             | -                                              | (10)                           |\n| As at 31 December 2020                         | 17,359                | 4,340                        | 297                           | 4,637                                          | 11,172                         |\n| As at 1 January 2019                           | 17,133                | 4,283                        | 28                            | 4,311                                          | 9,632                          |\n| Issued to staff under share incentive plans    | 76                    | 19                           | 82                            | 101                                            | -                              |\n| Issuances relating to Scrip Dividend Programme | 113                   | 29                           | 153                           | 182                                            | -                              |\n| AT1 securities issuance                        | -                     | -                            | -                             | -                                              | 3,500                          |\n| AT1 securities redemption                      | -                     | -                            | -                             | -                                              | (2,262)                        |\n| Other movements                                | -                     | -                            | -                             | -                                              | 1                              |\n| As at 31 December 2019                         | 17,322                | 4,331                        | 263                           | 4,594                                          | 10,871                         |",

As at 31 December 2020, Barclays Bank PLC has in issue preference shares and Upper Tier 2 instruments. These are non-controlling interests to the Group.\n\n## Barclays Bank PLC and protective rights of non-controlling interests\n\nA fixed coupon rate is attached to all Upper Tier 2 instruments until the initial call date, with the exception of the 9% Bonds, which are fixed for the life of the issue and the Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3 Undated Notes, which are floating rate at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\nThe payment of preference share dividends and Upper Tier 2 coupons are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC, except for coupon payments that become compulsory where Barclays PLC has declared or paid a dividend on ordinary shares, or in certain cases, any class of preference shares, in the preceding six-month period. Barclays Bank PLC is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds if, in the immediately preceding 12-month interest period, a dividend has not been paid on any class of its share capital. Coupons not paid becomes payable in each case if such a dividend is subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances. No dividend or coupon payments may be made unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test. Under the terms of these instruments, Barclays PLC may not pay dividends on ordinary shares until a dividend or coupon is next paid on these instruments or the instruments are redeemed or purchased by Barclays Bank PLC. There are no restrictions on Barclays Bank PLC's ability to remit capital to the Parent as a result of these issued instruments.\n\nAfter the initial call date, in the event they are not redeemed, coupon payments in relation to the 6.125% Undated Notes, and the 9.25% Bonds are fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates. Coupon payments for all other Upper Tier 2 instruments are at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period. The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share awards is recognised is based upon the period employees consider their services contribute to the awards. For past awards, the Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest. In relation to awards granted from 2017, the Group, taking into account the changing employee understanding surrounding those awards, considered it appropriate for expense to be recognised over the vesting period including the financial year prior to the grant date.\n\n|                                                                                | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Incentive awards granted:                                                      |           |           |           |\n| Current year bonus                                                             | 1,090     | 1,058     | 1,131     |\n| Deferred bonus                                                                 | 490       | 432       | 518       |\n| Total incentive awards granted                                                 | 1,580     | 1,490     | 1,649     |\n| Reconciliation of incentive awards granted to income statement charge:         |           |           |           |\n| Less: deferred bonuses granted but not charged in current year                 | (335)     | (293)     | (359)     |\n| Add: current year charges for deferred bonuses from previous years             | 293       | 308       | 299       |\n| Other differences between incentive awards granted and income statement charge | (34)      | (48)      | (33)      |\n| Income statement charge for performance costs                                  | 1,504     | 1,457     | 1,556     |\n| Other income statement charges:                                                |           |           |           |\n| Salaries                                                                       | 4,322     | 4,332     | 4,200     |\n| Social security costs                                                          | 613       | 573       | 558       |\n| Post-retirement benefits\u00aa                                                      | 519       | 501       | 619       |\n| Other compensation costs                                                       | 479       | 480       | 413       |\n| Total compensation costs b                                                     | 7,437     | 7,343     | 7,346     |\n| Other resourcing costs:                                                        |           |           |           |\n| Outsourcing                                                                    | 342       | 433       | 594       |\n| Redundancy and restructuring                                                   | 102       | 132       | 133       |\n| Temporary staff costs                                                          | 102       | 256       | 386       |\n| Other                                                                          | 114       | 151       | 170       |\n| Total other resourcing costs                                                   | 660       | 972       | 1,283     |\n| Total staff costs                                                              | 8,097     | 8,315     | 8,629     |\n\nNotes\n\n- b  \u00a3451m (2019: \u00a3439m; 2018: \u00a3296m) of Group compensation was capitalised as internally generated software.\n- a Post-retirement benefits charge includes \u00a3279m (2019: \u00a3270m; 2018: \u00a3236m) in respect of defined contribution schemes and \u00a3240m (2019: \u00a3231m; 2018: \u00a3383m) in respect of defined benefit schemes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services. The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.\n\nThe number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met. Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.\n\nThe fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability. The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest. These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions - such as continuing to make payments into a share-based savings scheme.\n\nThe charge for the year arising from share-based payment schemes was as follows:\n\n|                                                | Charge for the year   | Charge for the year   | Charge for the year   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                | 2020 \u00a3m               | 2019 \u00a3m               | 2018 \u00a3m               |\n| Deferred Share Value Plan and Share Value Plan | 245                   | 272                   | 262                   |\n| Others                                         | 184                   | 206                   | 187                   |\n| Total equity settled                           | 429                   | 478                   | 449                   |\n| Cash settled                                   | 2                     | 3                     | 1                     |\n| Total share-based payments                     | 431                   | 481                   | 450                   |\n\nThe terms of the main current plans are as follows:\n\nThe SVP was introduced in March 2010. SVP awards have been granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, five or seven years. Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares. For awards granted before December 2017, the grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award. SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes. All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.\n\n## Share Value Plan (SVP)\n\n## Deferred Share Value Plan (DSVP)\n\n## Other schemes\n\nThe DSVP was introduced in February 2017. The terms of the DSVP are materially the same as the terms of the SVP as described above, save that Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the DSVP and the DSVP operates over market purchase shares only.\n\nIn addition to the SVP and DSVP, the Barclays Group operates a number of other schemes settled in Barclays PLC Shares including Sharesave (both UK and Ireland), Sharepurchase (both UK and overseas), and the Barclays Group Long Term Incentive Plan. A delivery of upfront shares to 'Material Risk Takers' can be made as a Share Incentive Award (Holding Period).",

The fixed forward price to be paid under these contracts is \u00a3126m and has been recorded in retained earnings.\n\nVarious employee benefit trusts established by the Group hold shares in Barclays PLC to meet obligations under the Barclays share-based payment schemes. The total number of Barclays shares held in these employee benefit trusts at 31 December 2020 was 17.1m (2019: 13.1m). Dividend rights have been waived on all these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year end share price of \u00a31.27 (2019: \u00a31.80) was \u00a322m (2019: \u00a324m).

Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension schemes and post-employment benefit schemes.\n\nDefined benefit schemes - the Group recognises its obligations to members of each scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test.\n\nChanges in pension scheme liabilities or assets (remeasurements) that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net defined benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income. Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments (differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred), the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in the interest on the assets) and any changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction (excluding amounts included in the interest on the restriction).\n\nEach scheme's obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.\n\nPost-employment benefit schemes - the cost of providing healthcare benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.\n\n## Pension schemes\n\nThe UKRF is the Group's main scheme, representing 97% of the Group's total retirement benefit obligations. Barclays Bank PLC is the principal employer of the UKRF. The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises 10 sections, the two most significant of which are:\n\n## UK Retirement Fund (UKRF)\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element. The cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index (RPI) (up to a maximum of 5% p.a.). An increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays' discretion. The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits for Afterwork members are borne by the UKRF. The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are limited although additional contributions are required if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.\n\n## Barclays Pension Savings Plan (BPSP)\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 The 1964 Pension Scheme. Most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010. Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary. From 1 April 2010, members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or the Pension Investment Plan (PIP), a historic defined contribution section which is now closed to future contributions. The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 section are typical of final salary pension schemes, principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.\n\nThe BPSP is a defined contribution scheme providing benefits for all new UK hires from 1 October 2012, BPSP is not subject to the same investment return, inflation or life expectancy risks for Barclays that defined benefit schemes are. Members' benefits reflect contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.\n\nApart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-retirement healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US defined benefit schemes. Many of the schemes are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts. Others are operated on an unfunded basis. The benefits provided, the approach to funding, and the legal basis of the schemes, reflect local environments.\n\n## Other\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays (and who are not members of the UKRF), plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff, deferred and pensioner members who apply for the role.\n\nThe UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation. The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.\n\nThe BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans. Each personal pension plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider (Legal & General Assurance Society Limited), and is regulated by the FCA.\n\nSimilar principles of pension governance apply to the Group's other pension schemes, depending on local legislation.",

The UKRF expected benefits are projected to be paid out for in excess of 50 years, although 25% of the total benefits are expected to be paid in the next 10 years; 30% in years 11 to 20 and 25% in years 20 to 30. The remainder of the benefits are expected to be paid beyond 30 years.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the UKRF's scheme assets were in surplus versus IAS 19 obligations by \u00a31,807m (2019: \u00a32,058m). The movement for the UKRF was driven by a net decrease in the discount rate and changes to pension increase assumptions, offset partially by higher than assumed asset returns. During the year the UKRF invested in non-transferable listed senior gilt-backed notes for \u00a3750m, partially financed by \u00a3500m deficit contributions (the 'Heron 2' transaction). The net impact of \u00a3250m on plan assets is shown as an outflow under 'Exchange and other movements'; further details of Heron 2 can be found on page 356.\n\nOf the \u00a31,370m (2019: \u00a31,410m) UKRF benefits paid out, \u00a3520m (2019: \u00a3580m) related to transfers out of the fund.\n\nWhere a scheme's assets exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of contributions (the asset ceiling). In the case of the UKRF the asset ceiling is not applied as, in certain specified circumstances such as wind-up, the Group expects to be able to recover any surplus. Similarly, a liability in respect of future minimum funding requirements is not recognised. The Trustee does not have a substantive right to augment benefits, nor do they have the right to wind up the plan except in the dissolution of the Group or termination of contributions by the Group. The application of the asset ceiling to other plans and recognition of additional liabilities in respect of future minimum funding requirements are considered on an individual plan basis.",

Below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for the UKRF.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\n|                                | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Key UKRF financial assumptions | % p.a. | % p.a. |\n| Discount rate                  | 1.29   | 1.92   |\n| Inflation rate (RPI)           | 2.99   | 3.02   |\n\nThe UKRF discount rate assumption for 2020 was based on a standard Willis Towers Watson RATE Link model. The UKRF discount rate assumption for 2019 was based on a variant of the standard Willis Towers Watson RATE Link model that included all bonds rated AA by at least one of the four major ratings agencies, and assumed that forward rates after year 30 were flat. The change in discount rate methodology as at 31 December 2020 led to a remeasurement gain of \u00a31.2bn. The RPI inflation assumption for 2020 was set by reference to the Bank of England's implied inflation curve. The inflation assumption incorporates a deduction of 20 basis points as an allowance for an inflation risk premium. The methodology used to derive the inflation assumptions is consistent with that used at the prior year end.\n\nThe UKRF's post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2019 of the UKRF's own post-retirement mortality experience, and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys. An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the 2019 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a long-term trend of 1.5% per annum in future improvements. The methodology used is consistent with the prior year end, except that the 2018 core projection model was used at 2019. The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the past three years:\n\n| Assumed life expectancy                                               | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners (years)                  |        |        |        |\n| - Males                                                               | 27.2   | 27.1   | 27.7   |\n| - Females                                                             | 29.4   | 29.3   | 29.4   |\n| Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 (years) |        |        |        |\n| - Males                                                               | 29.0   | 28.9   | 29.2   |\n| - Females                                                             | 31.2   | 31.1   | 31.0   |\n\nOn 11 December 2020, the UKRF entered into a \u00a35bn longevity swap to hedge around a quarter of current pensioner liabilities against unexpected increases in life expectancy. The swap will form part of the UKRF's investment portfolio and provide income in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The UKRF Trustee established a Guernsey-based captive insurer (Barclays UKRF No.1 IC Limited) to act as an insurance intermediary between the UKRF and swap provider. The swap is not included directly within the balance sheet of Barclays PLC as it is an asset of the UKRF. At 31 December 2020, the swap is valued at nil fair value as it is considered to remain at fair market value for both parties over the very limited period from 11 December 2020 to 31 December 2020.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly. The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown. The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions\n\nChange in key assumptions\n\n|                       | 2020 (Decrease)/  Increase in  UKRF defined  benefit  obligation \u00a3bn   | 2019 (Decrease)/  Increase in  UKRF defined  benefit  obligation \u00a3bn   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Discount rate         |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| 0.5% p.a. increase    | (2.5)                                                                  | (2.3)                                                                  |\n| 0.25% p.a. increase   | (1.3)                                                                  | (1.2)                                                                  |\n| 0.25% p.a. decrease   | 1.4                                                                    | 1.2                                                                    |\n| 0.5% p.a. decrease    | 2.9                                                                    | 2.6                                                                    |\n| Assumed RPI           |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| 0.5% p.a. increase    | 1.8                                                                    | 1.5                                                                    |\n| 0.25% p.a. increase   | 0.9                                                                    | 0.8                                                                    |\n| 0.25% p.a. decrease   | (0.9)                                                                  | (0.7)                                                                  |\n| 0.5% p.a. decrease    | (1.8)                                                                  | (1.4)                                                                  |\n| Life expectancy at 60 |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| One year increase     | 1.2                                                                    | 1.0                                                                    |\n| One year decrease     | (1.2)                                                                  | (1.0)                                                                  |",

This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others. The long-term investment strategy ensures, among other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.\n\n## Assets\n\nThe UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to liabilities. The value of assets shown reflects the assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a fair value basis.\n\nThe value of the assets of the schemes and their percentage in relation to total scheme assets were as follows:\n\nAnalysis of scheme assets\n\n|                                 | Total       | Total         | Total    | Total                                       | Of which relates to UKRF   | Of which relates to UKRF   | Of which relates to UKRF   | Of which relates to UKRF                    |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | Quoted a \u00a3m | Unquoted a \u00a3m | Value \u00a3m | % of total fair  value of  scheme  assets % | Quoted a \u00a3m                | Unquoted a \u00a3m              | Value \u00a3m                   | % of total fair  value of  scheme  assets % |\n| As at 31 December 2020          |             |               |          |                                             |                            |                            |                            |                                             |\n| Equities                        | 567         | 1,498         | 2,065    | 5.9                                         | 378                        | 1,498                      | 1,876                      | 5.5                                         |\n| Private equities                | -

Valuations on complex instruments are based on UKRF custodian valuations. All valuations are determined in accordance with relevant industry guidance.\n\nIncluded within the fair value of scheme assets were nil (2019: nil) relating to shares in Barclays PLC and nil (2019: nil) relating to bonds issued by Barclays PLC. The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by Barclays PLC.\n\nApproximately 45% of the UKRF assets are invested in liability-driven investment strategies; primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps. These are used to better match the assets to its liabilities. The swaps are used to reduce the scheme's inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.\n\nThe UKRF assets above do not include the Senior Notes asset referred to in the section below on Triennial Valuation, as these are non-transferable instruments and not recognised under IAS 19.\n\n## Triennial valuation\n\nThe main differences between the funding and accounting assumptions are a different approach to setting the discount rate and a more conservative longevity assumption for funding.\n\nThe latest annual update as at 30 September 2020 showed the funding deficit had improved to \u00a30.9bn from the \u00a32.3bn shown at the 30 September 2019 triennial valuation. The improvement was mainly due to \u00a31.0bn of deficit reduction contributions paid over the year.",

These Senior Notes entitle the UKRF to semi-annual coupon payments for five years, and full repayment in cash in three equal tranches in 2023, 2024, and at final maturity in 2025. The Senior Notes were issued by Heron Issuer Number 2 Limited (Heron 2), an entity that is consolidated within the Group under IFRS 10. As a result of the investment in Senior Notes, the regulatory capital impact of the \u00a3500m deficit reduction contribution paid on 12 June 2020 takes effect in 2023, 2024 and 2025 on maturity of the notes. As the UKRF's investment in the Senior Notes does not qualify as a plan asset under IAS 19, the \u00a3500m deficit reduction contribution does not appear in the IAS19 plan assets nor as an employer contribution as at 31 December 2020, and the additional \u00a3250m scheme investment appears as an outflow in the balance sheet reconciliation under 'Exchange and other movements'. The \u00a3250m additional investment by the UKRF in the Senior Notes has a positive capital impact in 2020 which is reduced equally in 2023, 2024 and 2025 on the maturity of the notes. Heron 2 acquired a total of \u00a3750m of gilts from Barclays Bank PLC for cash to support payments on the senior notes. A transaction with a similar structure was agreed as part of the 2019 triennial actuarial valuation. On 11 December 2019, Barclays Bank PLC paid the \u00a3500m deficit reduction contribution agreed for 2019 and at the same time the UKRF subscribed for non-transferrable listed senior fixed rate notes for \u00a3500m, backed by UK gilts (the Senior Notes). These Senior Notes entitle the UKRF to semi-annual coupon payments for five years, and full repayment in cash at maturity in 2024. As the UKRF's investment in these Senior Notes does not qualify as a plan asset under IAS 19, the 2019 \u00a3500m deficit reduction contribution does not appear in the IAS 19 plan assets. No liability is recognised under IAS 19 for the obligation to make deficit reduction contributions or to repay the Senior Notes, as settlement gives rise to both a reduction in cash and a corresponding increase in net defined benefit assets.\n\n## Other support measures agreed which remain in place\n\nThe deficit reduction contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Group's share of the cost of benefits accruing over each year. The next funding valuation of the UKRF is due to be completed in 2023 with an effective date of 30 September 2022.\n\nCollateral - The UKRF Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC have entered into an arrangement whereby a collateral pool has been put in place to provide security for the UKRF funding deficit as it increases or decreases over time. The collateral pool is currently made up of government securities, and agreement was made with the Trustee to cover at least 100% of the funding deficit with an overall cap of \u00a39bn. The arrangement provides the UKRF Trustee with dedicated access to the pool of assets in the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution to the UKRF or in the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency. These assets are included within Note 38 Assets pledged, collateral received and assets transferred.\n\nParticipation - As permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Banking Reform) (Pensions) Regulations 2015, Barclays Bank UK PLC is a participating employer in the UKRF and will remain so during a transitional phase until September 2025 as set out in a deed of participation. Barclays Bank UK PLC will make contributions for the future service of its employees who are currently Afterwork members and, in the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency during this period provision has been made to require Barclays Bank UK PLC to become the principal employer of the UKRF. Barclays Bank PLC's Section 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency (the debt would be calculated after allowing for the payment to the UKRF of the collateral above).\n\nSupport from Barclays PLC - In the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution payment required by a specified pre-payment date, Barclays PLC has entered into an arrangement whereby it will be required to use, in first priority, dividends received from Barclays Bank UK PLC (if any) to invest the proceeds in Barclays Bank PLC (up to the maximum amount of the deficit reduction contribution unpaid by Barclays Bank PLC). The proceeds of the investment will be used to discharge Barclays Bank PLC's unpaid deficit reduction contribution.\n\nDefined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows:\n\n|      | Contributions paid   |\n|------|----------------------|\n|      | \u00a3m                   |\n| 2020 | 748                  |\n| 2019 | 1,231                |\n| 2018 | 741                  |\n\nThere were nil (2019: nil; 2018: nil) Section 75 contributions included within the Group's contributions paid as no participating employers left the UKRF in 2020.\n\nThe Group's expected contribution to the UKRF in respect of defined benefits in 2021 is \u00a3959m (2020: \u00a3743m). In addition, the expected contributions to UK defined contribution schemes in 2021 is \u00a335m (2020: \u00a333m) to the UKRF and \u00a3209m (2020: \u00a3185m) to the BPSP.",

Detail is also given on securitisation transactions the Group has entered into and arrangements that are held off-balance sheet.\n\n## 34 Principal subsidiaries\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements . The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of the Group and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Under IFRS 10, this is when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.\n\nThe significant judgements used in applying this policy are set out below.\n\nIn the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment.\n\n## Accounting for investment in subsidiaries\n\nPrincipal subsidiaries for the Group are set out below. This includes those subsidiaries that are most significant in the context of the Group's business, results or financial position.\n\n| Company name                        | Principal place of business or incorporation   | Nature of business       |   Percentage  of voting  rights  held % | Non- controlling  interests -  proportion  of ownership  interests %   | Non- controlling  interests  proportion  of voting  interests %   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Barclays Bank PLC                   | United Kingdom                                 | Banking, holding company |                                     100 | 2                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays Bank UK PLC                | United Kingdom                                 | Banking, holding company |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays Bank Ireland PLC           | Ireland                                        | Banking                  |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays Execution Services Limited | United Kingdom                                 | Service company          |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays Capital Inc.               | United States                                  | Securities dealing       |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays Capital Securities Limited | United Kingdom                                 | Securities dealing       |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays Securities Japan Limited   | Japan                                          | Securities dealing       |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays US LLC                     | United States                                  | Holding company          |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n| Barclays Bank Delaware              | United States                                  | Credit card issuer       |                                     100 | -                                                                      | -                                                                 |\n\nThe country of registration or incorporation is also the principal area of operation of each of the above subsidiaries.\n\nDetermining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital. However, in certain instances, this determination will involve judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement will involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.\n\nOwnership interests are in some cases different to voting interests due to the existence of non-voting equity interests, such as preference shares. Refer to Note 30 for more information.\n\nThere is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities. In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors' exposures to the structure's variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity.\n\nAn interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% would typically indicate that the Group has control of an entity. However, the entity set out below is excluded from consolidation because the Group does not have exposure to its variable returns.\n\n| Country of registration or incorporation   | Company name     |   Percentage  of voting  rights held % | Equity  shareholders' funds \u00a3m   | Retained  profit for  the year \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Cayman Islands                             | Palomino Limited |                                    100 | -                                | -                                   |\n\nThis entity is managed by an external counterparty and consequently is not controlled by the Group. Interests relating to this entity are included in Note 35.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Scope of consolidation continued\n\n## 34 Principal subsidiaries continued\n\nAs is typical for a group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests. These are considered below.\n\n## Significant restrictions\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nIn order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may issue certain equity-accounted and debt-accounted financial instruments and non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities. Refer to Note 27 and Note 28 for particulars of these instruments. These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.\n\nBarclays' principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of \u00a31,795bn (2019: \u00a31,474bn) and \u00a31,703bn (2019: \u00a31,388bn) respectively. Certain of these assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated. These require entities to maintain minimum capital levels which cannot be returned to the parent company, Barclays PLC, on a going concern basis.\n\n## Liquidity requirements\n\n## Statutory requirements\n\nRegulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to meet applicable PRA or local regulatory requirements pertaining to liquidity. Some of the regulated subsidiaries include Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited (which are regulated on a combined basis under a Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (DoLSub) arrangement), Barclays Bank UK PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware. Refer to the Liquidity risk section for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of the Group's significant subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation. In most cases, the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.\n\nThe Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks, as well as to provide security to the UK Retirement Fund. Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group. The assets typically affected are disclosed in Note 38.\n\n## Asset encumbrance\n\n## Other restrictions\n\nThe Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities, and these amounted to \u00a33,392m (2019: \u00a34,893m).\n\n## 35 Structured entities\n\nDepending on the Group's power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.\n\nA structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Securitisation vehicles: The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer. Refer to Note 37 for further detail.\n\nThe Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured entities:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Commercial paper (CP) and medium-term conduits: The Group provided \u00a311.7bn (2019: \u00a38.3bn) in undrawn contractual backstop liquidity facilities to CP conduits.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Other trusts: During 2020, the Group provided undrawn liquidity facilities of \u00a32.9bn (2019: \u00a32.5bn) to certain trusts.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Employee benefit trusts: The Group provides capital contributions to employee benefit trusts to enable them to meet obligations to employees in relation to share-based remuneration arrangements.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group has an interest\n\nInterest rate swaps, foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures below.\n\nAn interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Group. Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.",

For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented. Other interests include conduits and lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand.\n\nThe Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity. Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing margining, the Group has minimal exposure to the performance of the structured entity counterparty. This includes margin lending which is presented under financial assets at fair value through the income statement to align to the balance sheet presentation.\n\n## Secured financing\n\n## Short-term traded interests\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, \u00a310,682m (2019: \u00a38,903m) of the Group's \u00a311,361m (2019: \u00a39,585m) short-term traded interests were comprised of debt securities issued by asset securitisation vehicles.\n\nThe Group buys and sells interests in structured entities as part of its trading activities, for example, retail mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and similar interests. Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 days. In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.\n\n## Traded derivatives\n\nDerivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Group is mainly exposed to settlement risk on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining. Total notional contract amounts were \u00a3153,894m (2019: \u00a3314,170m).\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit indices among other things. The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities include indexbased and entity specific credit default swaps, balance guaranteed swaps, total return swaps, commodities swaps, and equity swaps. A description of the types of derivatives and the risk management practices are detailed in Note 14. The risk of loss may be mitigated through ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment waterfall. Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Group's normal credit policies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the Group's losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other assets in most cases.\n\nThe Group's interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the purpose of the entities and limited to significant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.\n\n| Nature of interest                                                |                                      |            |          |          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|----------|----------|\n|                                                                   | Multi-seller  conduit  programmes \u00a3m | Lending \u00a3m | Other \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| As at 31 December 2020                                            |                                      |            |          |          |\n| Trading portfolio assets                                          | -                                    | -          | -        | -        |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income statement       | -                                    | 98         | 2,766    | 2,864    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | -                                    | 106        | 47       | 153      |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost                              | 5,146                                | 12,721     | 3,079    | 20,946   |\n| Other assets                                                      | 8                                    | 3          | 5        | 16       |\n| Total on-balance sheet exposures                                  | 5,154                                | 12,928     | 5,897    | 23,979   |\n| Total off-balance sheet notional amounts                          | 11,750                               | 7,555      | -        | 19,305   |\n| Maximum exposure to loss                                          | 16,904                               | 20,483     | 5,897    | 43,284   |\n| Total assets of the entity                                        | 87,004                               | 159,804    | 36,083   | 282,891  |\n| As at 31 December 2019                                            |                                      |            |          |          |\n| Trading portfolio assets                                          | -                                    | -          | 76       | 76       |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income statement       | -                                    | 159        | 2,500    | 2,659    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | -                                    | -          | 391      | 391      |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost                              | 5,930                                | 8,132      | 4,999    | 19,061   |\n| Other assets                                                      | 17                                   | 4          | 7        | 28       |\n| Total on-balance sheet exposures                                  | 5,947                                | 8,295      | 7,973    | 22,215   |\n| Total off-balance sheet notional amounts                          | 8,649                                | 3,751      | 1,621    | 14,021   |\n| Maximum exposure to loss                                          | 14,596                               | 12,046     | 9,594    | 36,236   |\n| Total assets of the entity                                        | 78,716                               | 145,181    | 34,099   | 257,996  |\n\n## Maximum exposure to loss\n\n## Multi-seller conduit programme\n\nUnless specified otherwise below, the Group's maximum exposure to loss is the total of its on-balance sheet positions and its off-balance sheet arrangements, being loan commitments and financial guarantees. Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral, financial guarantees, the availability of netting and credit protection held.\n\nThe multi-seller conduit engages in providing financing to various clients and holds whole or partial interests in pools of receivables or similar obligations. These instruments are protected from loss through overcollateralisation, seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduit. The Group's off-balance sheet exposure included in the table above represents liquidity facilities that are provided to the conduit for the benefit of the holders of the commercial paper issued by the conduit and will only be drawn where the conduit is unable to access the commercial paper market. If these liquidity facilities are drawn, the Group is protected from loss through overcollateralisation, seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduit.\n\nThe portfolio includes lending provided by the Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its lending business to earn income in the form of interest and lending fees and includes loans to structured entities that are generally collateralised by property, equipment or other assets. All loans are subject to the Group's credit sanctioning process. Collateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor of the structured entity for certain arrangements. During the period the Group incurred an impairment of \u00a323m (2019: \u00a37m) against such facilities.\n\n## Lending\n\n## Other\n\n## Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThis includes fair value loans with structured entities where the market risk is materially hedged with corresponding derivative contracts, interests in debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles and drawn and undrawn loan facilities to these entities. In addition, other includes investment funds with interests restricted to management fees based on performance of the fund and trusts held on behalf of beneficiaries with interests restricted to unpaid fees.\n\nAssets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities were \u00a3730m (2019: \u00a3471m).",

The Group ceases to recognise its share of the losses of equity accounted associates when its share of the net assets and amounts due from the entity have been written off in full, unless it has a contractual or constructive obligation to make good its share of the losses. In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements . Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies. Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares. Joint ventures are arrangements where the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nThere are no individually significant investments in joint ventures or associates held by the Group.\n\n|                                           |                                          |          | 2019          | 2019              | 2019     |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|\n|                                           | 2020 Associates \u00a3m Joint ventures \u00a3m 464 | Total \u00a3m | Associates \u00a3m | Joint ventures \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Equity accounted                          | 317                                      | 781      | 457           | 264               | 721      |\n| Held at fair value through profit or loss | - 437                                    | 437      | -             | 516               | 516      |\n| Total                                     | 464 754                                  | 1,218    | 457           | 780               | 1,237    |\n\nSummarised financial information for the Group's equity accounted associates and joint ventures is set out below.

In addition, the Group has made commitments to finance or otherwise provide resources to its joint ventures and associates of \u00a3443m (2019: \u00a3403m).\n\n## 37 Securitisations\n\n## Accounting for securitisations\n\nSecuritisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction; lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in those assets or lead to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer. Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.\n\nIn the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty. Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.\n\nA summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below:",

In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet:\n\nSecuritisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction. Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.\n\n|                                                  | 2020                 | 2020          | 2020                 | 2020          | 2019                 | 2019          | 2019                 | 2019          |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|\n|                                                  | Assets               | Assets        | Liabilities          | Liabilities   | Assets               | Assets        | Liabilities          | Liabilities   |\n|                                                  | Carrying  amount  \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Carrying  amount  \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Carrying  amount  \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Carrying  amount  \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost             |                      |               |                      |               |                      |               |                      |               |\n| Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending | 1,033                | 1,121         | (1,019)              | (1,033)       | 3,516                | 3,678         | (2,918)              | (2,922)       |\n\nBalances included within loans and advances at amortised cost represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Group.\n\n## Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised\n\nThe relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets. For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, refer to Note 38.\n\nIn some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it. This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Group's involvement with asset backed securities, residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.\n\nThe table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement:\n\n|                                        | Continuing involvement\u00aa   | Continuing involvement\u00aa   | Continuing involvement\u00aa       | Gain/(loss) from continuing  involvement   | Gain/(loss) from continuing  involvement   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Type of transfer                       | Carrying  amount  \u00a3m      | Fair value \u00a3m             | Maximum  exposure to  loss \u00a3m | For the  year ended \u00a3m                     | Cumulative to  31 December \u00a3m              |\n| 2020                                   |                           |                           |                               |                                            |                                            |\n| Asset backed securities                | 56                        | 56                        | 56                            | 1                                          | 1                                          |\n| Residential mortgage backed securities | 49                        | 49                        | 49                            | 1                                          | 1                                          |\n| Commercial mortgage backed securities  | 243                       | 237                       | 243                           | 2                                          | 6                                          |\n| Total                                  | 348                       | 342                       | 348                           | 4                                          | 8                                          |\n| 2019                                   |                           |                           |                               |                                            |                                            |\n| Commercial mortgage backed securities  | 189                       | 188                       | 189                           | 1                                          | 4                                          |\n| Total                                  | 189                       | 188                       | 189                           | 1                                          | 4                                          |\n\n## Note\n\n- a   Assets which represent the Group's continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in Loans and advances at amortised cost and Debt securities at FVTP&L.",

In these transactions, the Group will be required to step in to provide financing itself under a liquidity facility if the vehicle cannot access the commercial paper market.\n\nAssets are pledged or transferred as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives. Assets transferred are non-cash assets transferred to a third party that do not qualify for derecognition from the Group balance sheet, for example because Barclays retains substantially all the exposure to those assets under an agreement to repurchase them in the future for a fixed price.\n\nWhere non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral for cash received, the asset continues to be recognised in full, and a related liability is also recognised on the balance sheet. Where non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral in an exchange for non-cash assets, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full, and there is no associated liability as the non-cash collateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet. The Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged assets. Unless stated, the counterparty's recourse is not limited to the transferred assets.\n\nThe following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security against these liabilities:\n\n|                                                                   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash collateral and settlements                                   | 72,042    | 64,400    |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost                              | 37,257    | 39,354    |\n| Trading portfolio assets                                          | 77,198    | 65,532    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income statement       | 5,584     | 10,104    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 22,185    | 9,278     |\n| Assets pledged                                                    | 214,266   | 188,668   |\n\nThe following table summarises the transferred financial assets and the associated liabilities:\n\n|                                 | Transferred  assets \u00a3m   | Associated  liabilities \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2020             |                          |                              |\n| Derivatives                     | 77,574                   | (77,574)                     |\n| Repurchase agreements           | 65,673                   | (44,076)                     |\n| Securities lending arrangements | 61,183                   | -                            |\n| Other                           | 9,836                    | (7,408)                      |\n|                                 | 214,266                  | (129,058)                    |\n| At 31 December 2019             |                          |                              |\n| Derivatives                     | 68,609                   | (68,609)                     |\n| Repurchase agreements           | 52,840                   | (35,708)                     |\n| Securities lending arrangements | 49,106                   | -                            |\n| Other                           | 18,113                   | (12,005)                     |\n|                                 | 188,668                  | (116,322)                    |\n\nIncluded within Other are agreements where a counterparty's recourse is limited to the transferred assets.

These include audit services for the review of the interim financial information under the Listing Rules of the UK listing authority.\n- a Comprises the fees for the statutory audit of subsidiaries both inside and outside the UK and fees for work performed by associates of KPMG in respect of the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n\n## 41 Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe Group's risk exposure is predominately to GBP, USD, JPY and CHF LIBOR and Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) with the vast majority concentrated in derivatives within the Corporate and Investment Bank. Some additional exposure resides on floating rate loans and advances, repurchase agreements and debt securities held and issued within the Corporate and Investment Bank. Retail lending and mortgage exposure in Barclays UK is minimal.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as IBOR has become a priority for global regulators. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other global regulators have instructed market participants to prepare for the cessation of LIBOR after the end of 2021, and to adopt 'near Risk-Free Rates' (RFRs). While it is expected that most reforms affecting the Group will be completed by the end of 2021, consultations and possible regulatory changes are in progress. This may mean that some LIBORs continue to be published beyond that date.\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be risk in respect of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) arising from IBOR reform as at 31 December 2020. This is because the calculation methodology of EURIBOR changed during 2019 and the reform of EURIBOR is complete. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (as the administrator of EURIBOR) granted authorisation with respect to EURIBOR under the European Union Benchmarks Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use EURIBOR after 1 January 2021 for both existing and new contracts. The EUR Risk Free Rate Working Group has not contemplated the cessation of EURIBOR. The Group expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future.\n\n## How the Group is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates\n\nThere are key differences between IBORs and RFRs. IBORs are 'term rates', which means that they are published for a borrowing period (for example three months), and they are 'forward-looking', because they are published at the beginning of a borrowing period, based upon an estimated inter-bank borrowing cost for the period. RFRs are based upon overnight rates from actual transactions, and are therefore published after the end of the overnight borrowing period. Furthermore, IBORs include a credit spread over the RFRs. Therefore, to transition existing contracts and agreements to RFRs, adjustments for term and credit differences may need to be applied to RFR-linked rates. The methodologies for determining these adjustments are undergoing in-depth consultations by industry working groups, on behalf of the respective global regulators and related market participants.\n\nBarclays has established a Group-wide LIBOR Transition Programme, with oversight from the Group Finance Director. The Programme spans all business lines and has cross-functional governance which includes Legal, Conduct Risk, Client Engagement and Communications, Risk, and Finance. The Transition Programme aims to drive strategic execution, and identify, manage and resolve key risks and issues as they arise. Accountable Executives are in place within key working groups across businesses and work streams. Barclays' transition plans primarily focus on G5 currencies while providing quarterly updates on progress and exposures to the PRA/FCA and other regulators as required.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Other disclosure matters continued\n\n## 41 Interest rate benchmark reform continued\n\nApproaches to transition exposure expiring post the expected end dates for LIBOR vary by product and nature of counterparty. The Group is actively engaging with the counterparties to transition or include appropriate fallback provisions and transition mechanisms in its floating rate assets and liabilities with maturities after 2021, when most IBORs are expected to cease to be published. For the derivative population, adherence to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol now provides Barclays with an efficient mechanism to amend outstanding trades to incorporate fallbacks. Beyond the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, there will be options to terminate or bilaterally agree new terms with counterparties. Barclays expects derivative contracts facing central clearing counterparties to follow a market-wide, standardised approach to reform.\n\nThe Transition Programme follows a risk based approach, using recognised 'change delivery' control standards, to drive strategic execution, and identify, manage and resolve key risks and issues as they arise. Accountable Executives are in place within key working groups, with overall Board oversight delegated to the Board Risk Committee and the Group Finance Director. Barclays performs a prominent stewardship role to drive orderly transition via our representation on official sector and industry working groups across all major jurisdictions and product classes. Additionally, the Group Finance Director is Chair of the UK's 'Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates', whose mandate is to catalyse a broad-based transition to using SONIA ('Sterling Overnight Index Average') as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark in bond, loan and derivatives markets.\n\nMarket participants are currently awaiting publication of the results of ICE Benchmark Administration's consultation on plans to cease publication of most LIBORs at end 2021, with certain, actively used USD LIBOR tenors continuing to be provided until end June 2023. The FCA expects to enable publication of a synthetic LIBOR rate for at least certain actively used GBP LIBOR tenors to facilitate roll-off of relevant contracts that cannot be actively transitioned by end 2021.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group has successfully delivered Alternative RFR product capabilities and alternatives to LIBOR across loans, bonds and derivatives. Good progress has been made in relation to client outreach and we have been actively engaging with customers and counterparties to transition or include the appropriate fallback provisions. The Group has in place detailed plans, processes and procedures to support the transition of the remainder during 2021. Barclays has adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for its major derivative dealing entities and we continue to track progress and engage with clients on their own adherence. Following the progress made during 2020, the Group continues to deliver technology and business process changes to ensure operational readiness in preparation for LIBOR cessation and transitions to RFRs that will be necessary during 2021 in line with official sector expectations and milestones.\n\n## Progress made during 2020\n\n## Risks to which the Group is exposed as a result of the transition\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Conduct and Litigation Risk: This is the risk that poor customer outcomes are brought about as a direct result of inappropriate or negligent conduct on the part of Barclays, in connection with IBOR transition.\n\nIBOR reform exposes the Group to various risks, which are being managed through the LIBOR Transition Programme. The material risks identified include those set out below:\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Operational Risk: The LIBOR Transition Programme cuts across all businesses and functions. There are a number of implementation challenges arising from transition, including technology, operations, client communication and the measurement of valuation, giving rise to additional operational risks.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Counterparty Credit Risk: LIBOR replacement presents an increased risk of clients wishing to renegotiate the terms of existing transactions. This is dependent on client behaviour and the outcome of resulting negotiations and could change the credit risk profile of client exposure.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Market Risk: Changes to Barclays Market Risk profile are expected due to IBOR transition. These changes are expected to be managed within risk appetite. IBOR transition will also impact the basis risk profile both at the cessation event (when broadly all LIBOR contracts fall back to alternatives) as well as in the interim period when alternative rates are referenced in contracts.\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Financial Risk: There is a risk to Barclays and its clients that markets are disrupted due to IBOR reform. This could give rise to financial losses should Barclays be unable to operate effectively in financial markets.\n\nA disorderly cessation of LIBOR would carry substantial economic, legal, regulatory, reputational and operational risks for Barclays and the industry in general. Barclays' expectation is that the transition away from LIBOR will be carefully managed and that measures including the broad adoption of ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, the approach the Central Clearing Counterparties are expected to follow, proactive client engagement, regulatory action and/or terminating or bilaterally amending contracts where clients do not wish to adopt new conventions (e.g. ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol), can mitigate the risks associated with a disorderly cessation.\n\n- \u25a0 \u25a0 Accounting Risk: This would occur if the hedged items and hedging instruments of Barclays hedging relationships were to transition away from IBORs: at different times; to different benchmarks; or using divergent methodologies resulting in significant volatility to the income statement either through hedge accounting ineffectiveness or failure of the hedge accounting relationships.\n\nThe Group does not expect material changes to its risk management approach and strategy as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.",

This exposure is not included within the table above due to its short dated nature.\n\n|                                                                 | GBP LIBOR \u00a3m   | USD LIBOR \u00a3m   | EONIA \u00a3m   | JPY LIBOR  \u00a3m   | CHF LIBOR \u00a3m   | Others \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| Derivative notional contract amount                             |                |                |            |                 |                |             |                    |\n| OTC interest rate derivatives                                   | 592,827        | 2,832,802      | 457,844    | 754,206         | 25,681         | 41,782      | 4,705,142          |\n| OTC interest rate derivatives - cleared by central counterparty | 1,684,553      | 2,891,029      | 638,202    | 1,091,479       | 119,382        | 198,113     | 6,622,758          |\n| Exchange traded interest rate derivatives                       | 300,182        | 333,705        | -          | -               | 2,494          | -           | 636,381            |\n| OTC foreign exchange derivatives                                | 155,285        | 589,334        | -          | 93,108          | 31,257         | 1,921       | 870,905            |\n| OTC equity and stock index derivatives                          | 1,845          | 7,946          | 544        | 1,929           | 491            | 2,141       | 14,896             |\n| Derivative notional contract amount                             | 2,734,692      | 6,654,816      | 1,096,590  | 1,940,722       | 179,305        |             | 243,957 12,850,082 |\n\nThe table above represents the derivative exposures to interest rate benchmark reform, which have yet to transition. The exposure disclosed is for positions with contractual maturities after 31 December 2021. Derivatives are reported by using the notional contract amount and where derivatives have both pay and receive legs with exposure to benchmark reform such as cross currency swaps, the notional contract amount is disclosed for both legs. As at 31 December 2020, there were \u00a3264bn of cross currency swaps where both the pay and receive legs are impacted by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe Group also had \u00a328bn of Barclays issued debt retained by the group, impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform, predominately in GBP and USD LIBOR.",

        "page_content": "## 42 Barclays PLC (the Parent company)\n\n## Dividends received from subsidiaries\n\n## Total income\n\nDividends received from subsidiaries of \u00a3763m (2019: \u00a31,560m, 2018: \u00a315,360m) largely relates to dividends received from Barclays Bank PLC \u00a3263m, Barclays Execution Services Limited \u00a3250m and Barclays Bank UK PLC \u00a3220m. The dividends received in 2018 included both a dividend in specie, representing the transfer of the holding in Barclays Bank UK PLC from Barclays Bank PLC to Barclays PLC, and ordinary dividends from subsidiaries.\n\n## Other income\n\nThe dividends received from its banking subsidiaries were paid up to Barclays PLC prior to the announcement made by the PRA on 31 March 2020 that capital be preserved for use in serving Barclays customers and clients through the extraordinary challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a response to this announcement, Barclays PLC took steps to provide additional capital to its banking subsidiaries. Further detail can be found in the notes below.\n\nOther income of \u00a31,192m (2019: \u00a31,760m, 2018: \u00a3923m) includes \u00a3857m (2019: \u00a3813m, 2018: \u00a3752m) of income received from gross coupon payments on Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC issued AT1 securities and \u00a3248m (2019: \u00a3947m) of fair value and foreign exchange losses on other positions with subsidiaries.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\n## Total assets and liabilities\n\nThe investment in subsidiaries of \u00a358,886m (2019: \u00a359,546m) predominantly relates to investments in Barclays Bank PLC of \u00a344,015m (2019: \u00a342,363m) and Barclays Bank UK PLC of \u00a314,245m (2019: 16,595m) which includes holdings of their AT1 securities of \u00a310,995m (2019: \u00a310,843m). The decrease of \u00a3660m during the year was predominantly driven by a \u00a32,573m impairment in the cost of investment of Barclays Bank UK PLC and the redemption of AT1 holdings of \u20ac1,000m, partially offset by capital contributions to Barclays Bank PLC totalling \u00a31,500m and Barclays Bank UK PLC totalling \u00a3220m, as well as additional AT1 holdings of $1,500m in Barclays Bank PLC.\n\n## Impairment in subsidiaries\n\nAt the end of each reporting period an impairment review is undertaken in respect of investment in the ordinary shares of subsidiaries. Impairment is indicated where the investment exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as a value in use (VIU) which is derived from the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investment. The VIU calculations use forecast attributable profit based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a five-year period as an approximation of future cash flows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the subsidiary being tested. A terminal growth rate has then been applied to the cash flows thereafter which is based upon expectations of future inflation rates. The review identified an impairment in the investment in Barclays Bank UK PLC (see below). For the other investment in subsidiaries the value in use calculated was higher than the carrying value.\n\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment, the review identified impairment of the investment in Barclays Bank UK PLC of \u00a32,573m, reducing its carrying value to \u00a311,672m. The VIU calculation uses five-year profit before tax forecasts based on the formally agreed medium term plans approved by the Board as an approximation of future cash flows. The Personal Banking cash flows specific to Barclays Bank UK PLC contained in the calculation have been extended to a sixth year (prior to the calculation of terminal values) to reflect an observed 15bp inflexion point in the yield curve which was beyond the period of the medium term plan.\n\nA 1% increase in the discount rate or terminal growth rate would increase the impairment amount in Barclays Bank UK by \u00a31,056m and \u00a3714m respectively. A reduction in the forecasted cash flows by 10% per annum would increase impairment by \u00a31,061m.\n\nA discount rate of 13.8% (2019: 13.7%) has been applied to the cash flow forecast. In determining the discount rate, management have identified a cost of equity associated with a market participant that closely resemble the subsidiary and adjusted for tax to arrive at the pre-tax equivalent rate. A terminal growth rate of 2.0% (2019: 1.6%) has been used to calculate a terminal value for the investment. In prior years the terminal growth rate used has been based on estimated economic growth rates (GDP). Due to the macroeconomic uncertainties management now consider inflation rates to provide a better approximation of future long-term growth.\n\n## Loans and advances in subsidiaries\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value\n\nDuring the year, loans and advances to subsidiaries decreased by \u00a34,140m to \u00a324,710m (2019: \u00a328,850m). The decrease was driven by the maturity of \u00a31,200m dated subordinated loans and waiving \u00a31,000m of dated subordinated loans in relation to Barclays Bank PLC, the maturity of \u00a31,100m dated subordinated notes in relation to Barclays Bank UK PLC, the \u00a3900m partial buy back of dated subordinated loans from Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC and a \u00a3220m reduction used to fund a capital contribution to Barclays Bank UK PLC. This was partially offset by c.\u00a31,300m new issuances of dated subordinated notes by Barclays Bank UK PLC to Barclays PLC.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value of \u00a39,507m (2019: \u00a33,498m) includes new issuances during the year of $2,500m Fixed Rate Resetting Senior Callable Notes, $1,750m Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Callable Notes, \u20ac2,000m Reset Notes, \u00a3400m Reset Notes and $300m Zero Coupon Callable Notes. The proceeds raised through these transactions were used to invest in subsidiaries of Barclays PLC and are included within the financial assets designated at fair value through the income statement balance of \u00a317,521m (2019: \u00a310,348m). The effect of changes in the liabilities' fair value, including those due to credit risk, is expected to offset the changes in the fair value of the related financial asset in the income statement The difference between the financial liabilities' carrying amount and the contractual amount on maturity is \u00a3324m (2019: \u00a3174m).",

Debt securities in issue of \u00a328,428m (2019: \u00a330,564m) have reduced in the year due to the maturity of positions with subsidiaries as well as the partial buy back of Senior Fixed Rate Notes of \u20ac330m and Senior Floating Rate Notes of $776m.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue\n\n## Management of internal investments, loans and advances\n\n## Total equity\n\nBarclays PLC retains the discretion to manage the nature of its internal investments in subsidiaries according to their regulatory and business needs.

The increase in the year is primarily due to shares issued under employee share schemes.\n\nOther equity instruments of \u00a311,169m (2019: \u00a310,865m) comprises AT1 securities issued by Barclays PLC. AT1 securities are perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities structured to qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at the relevant issue date.

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\nThere are a number of key judgement areas, for example impairment calculations, which are based on models and which are subject to ongoing adjustment and modifications. Reported numbers reflect best estimates and judgements at the given point in time.\n\nThe terms Barclays or Group refer to Barclays PLC together with its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise stated, the income statement analysis compares the year ended 31 December 2020 to the corresponding twelve months of 2019 and balance sheet analysis as at 31 December 2020 with comparatives relating to 31 December 2019. The abbreviations '\u00a3m' and '\u00a3bn' represent millions and thousands of millions of Pounds Sterling respectively; the abbreviations '$m' and '$bn' represent millions and thousands of millions of US Dollars respectively; and the abbreviations '\u20acm' and '\u20acbn' represent millions and thousands of millions of Euros respectively.\n\nRelevant terms that are used in this document but are not defined under applicable regulatory guidance or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are explained in the results glossary that can be accessed at home.barclays/ investor-relations/reports-and-events/latest-financial-results.\n\nThese results will be filed on a Form 20-F with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as practicable following their publication. Once filed with the SEC, a copy of the Form 20-F will be available from the Barclays Investor Relations website at home.barclays/annualreport and from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\n\nThe information in this announcement, which was approved by the Board of Directors on 17 February 2021, does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2020, which contain an unmodified audit report under Section 495 of the Companies Act 2006 (which does not make any statements under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006), will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with Section 441 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nBarclays is a frequent issuer in the debt capital markets and regularly meets with investors via formal road-shows and other ad hoc meetings. Consistent with its usual practice, Barclays expects that from time to time over the coming quarter it will meet with investors globally to discuss these results and other matters relating to the Group.\n\n## Non-IFRS performance measures\n\nBarclays management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses' performance between financial periods and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group. They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by Barclays management. However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well. Refer to pages 253 to 258 for further information and calculations of non-IFRS performance measures included throughout this document, and the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but also may be made verbally by members of the management of the Group (including, without limitation, during management presentations to financial analysts) in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, income growth, assets, impairment charges, provisions, business strategy, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions (including dividend payout ratios and expected payment strategies), projected levels of growth in the banking and financial markets, projected costs or savings, any commitments and targets, estimates of capital expenditures, plans and objectives for future operations, projected employee numbers, IFRS impacts and other statements that are not historical fact. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. The forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by: changes in legislation; the development of standards and interpretations under IFRS, including evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of accounting and regulatory standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; future levels of conduct provisions; the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities; the Group's ability along with government and other stakeholders to manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; geopolitical risks; and the impact of competition. In addition, factors including (but not limited to) the following may have an effect: capital, leverage and other regulatory rules applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions; the effects of any volatility in credit markets; market related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; effects of changes in valuation of credit market exposures; changes in valuation of issued securities; volatility in capital markets; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by such entities; direct and indirect impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; instability as a result of the UK's exit from the European Union (EU), the effects of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the disruption that may subsequently result in the UK and globally; the risk of cyber-attacks, information or security breaches or technology failures on the Group's business or operations; and the success of future acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these influences and factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the Group's actual financial position, future results, capital distributions, capital, leverage or other regulatory ratios or other financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and factors which may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in our filings with the SEC (including, without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2020), which are available\n\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements\n\non the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\n\nSubject to our obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction, (including, without limitation, the UK and the US), in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis report is printed on Revive 100 Offset, made from 100% FSC\u00ae Recycled certified fibre sourced from de-inked post-consumer waste.
