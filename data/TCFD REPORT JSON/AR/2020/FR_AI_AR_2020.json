'\n\n## Mobilization\n\nUnprecedented. That is the first word that comes to my mind to describe 2020. The pandemic that is still affecting us today has profoundly changed our lives. It is in such challenging times that the full strength of a group like ours reveals itself. Air Liquide's teams across the world have been working harder than ever to support our customers and patients, while being resolutely committed to the fight against covid-19 alongside governments and healthcare workers. The teams have demonstrated their professionalism, both on site and remotely, and have done a remarkable job. I would like to underline my immense pride in the extent of this mobilization.\n\n## Performance\n\nThis unprecedented year has, once again, confirmed the strength of our business model and of our strategy. The Group's performance against the background of this crisis was outstanding. In 2020, we generated revenue of more than \u20ac20 billion, which was almost stable on a comparable basis compared with 2019. Gas & Services sales, comprising 96% of Group revenue, held up well, as did Global Markets & Technologies which retained its momentum. Healthcare, which was at the front line during the pandemic notably with the supply of medical oxygen, and Electronics have grown significantly. Geographically, the situation was varied with Europe faring well and a solid performance from the developing economies, particularly China, Eastern European and Latin American countries.\n\nThe results obtained highlight the Group's resilience in a crisis context. The operating margin improved sharply due both to structural efficiencies, which reached \u20ac441 million, and to exceptional cost control measures.",

        "page_content": "## ' We have made pioneering investments in the field of hydrogen, convinced from the outset of its immense potential as a clean energy carrier. '\n\nFinally, 2020 saw a high level of investment decisions, which were maintained despite the context and reached \u20ac3.2 billion, representing a guarantee of the Group's future growth.\n\n## Responsibility\n\nResilience, therefore, but also responsibility in terms of the challenges facing our world and society. We believe that the future is a shared asset which can only be shaped through responsible growth. Faced with the climate emergency and changes in society, which have been accelerated by the crisis, it is time for action, more than ever, and companies must play their full part. Two years after Air Liquide announced the most ambitious Climate Objectives in its sector, we therefore wanted to take our sustainable development commitments even further.\n\nIn practical terms, for our Group, that means adopting a proactive policy to reduce our own emissions. That also means committing to a low-carbon society, in particular through hydrogen which will play a key role in the energy transition. And finally, that also means being a model corporate citizen, in terms of our actions and with all of our stakeholders, and working together to invent and live the future. In 2021, these commitments have taken on a new dimension, with the implementation of a more ambitious strategy and the definition of new sustainable development objectives.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe Group has unique advantages which allows it to have a long-term vision of its performance. These assets are based, in particular, on the strength of its business model, the expertise of its teams, and the quality of its positions on markets of the future which pave the way to new growth opportunities.\n\nAir Liquide is deeply committed to the climate and the energy transition and we fully believe in the major role that our decarbonization solutions - and in particular hydrogen - will play in the development of a low-carbon society.\n\nHealthcare, which has reached a new level during the health crisis, also represents one of the focuses of our future growth.\n\nFinally, in a world where technological progress is accelerating, in particular in the digital field, our expertise places us in a perfect position in the race to future growth, for example to support the expansion of the electronics industry and that of high tech sectors such as deep cryogenics, space, and quantum technology. We firmly believe that our technologies and our ability to innovate will make a difference in the transformation that is currently underway.\n\n## Confidence\n\nDuring this period which remains uncertain, we are facing the future with caution, but also with audacity and confidence. Confidence in the opportunities before us. Confidence, too, in our ability to seize them. Inventing the future has been our business for over a century. I sincerely believe that, together, we can continue to invent this future and, more than ever, to live it.\n\n' The climate and energy transition, Healthcare, Technologies and in particular digital, the Group is well positioned on the markets of the future.

        "page_content": "## A GROUP INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HEALTH CRISIS\n\nAir Liquide is present in 78 countries with approximately 64,500 employees and serves more than 3.8 million customers and patients. Oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen are essential small molecules for life, matter and energy. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, which impacts each and everyone of us, our first objective has been and continues to be the health and safety of everyone.\n\nHealth and safety have always been Air Liquide's top priorities. This is why we are closely monitoring the evolution of this unprecedented crisis in all the countries in which the Group is present. From the outset, we have implemented measures to protect efficiently the health of our employees, patients, customers and partners.\n\nCrisis management organizations have been set-up at Group level and in each entity. The worldwide presence of the Group has enabled us to share best practices efficiently and set up clear protocols. Strict protocols and work organization adjustments have been put in place and are continuously adapted according to the evolution of the situation. Human Resources and Health & Safety teams have worked together very closely to adapt the work organization on site to enable our field operations to continue while protecting the health of our employees.\n\nThroughout the world, the different Human Resources teams are staying in contact with employees, in particular through regular communication (e-mails, calls and surveys). They are providing updates on the evolution of local health situations and restrictions, informing on the processes to follow, offering support, reminding employees of the different tools they have at their disposal (like medical insurance schemes, phone support helpline) and sharing tips on improving the well-being at home through short videos. The collaborative platform called 'Kite' was leveraged by providing employees with the opportunity to create and access Google+ communities. Employees were also reminded about cyber risks on a regular basis.\n\nTo ensure motivation and close follow-up of Air Liquide employees, support has been provided to management (Engagement survey with virtual close the loop sessions, virtual workshops to organize, as well as virtual coffee break where anyone can join, open Q&A with management). E-learnings on 'working remotely' and 'managing remotely' were available at the end of March for all. The crisis was also leveraged to digitize further our Learning offer, and two digital campuses were organized, and powered by our Kite platform, enabling presentations, working in small Groups, etc. The first one starting as early as mid-April, has regrouped more than 3,500 employees around 200 sessions, 150 being internal webinars animated by Air Liquide experts. On top of learning, it has enabled our teams throughout the world to directly interact, reinforcing a sense of belonging.\n\nThe second one took place in November-December. From June to September, a first capitalization of the work organization took place, with the support of more than 100 managers and employees throughout the world, built around four pillars (Mobile working, Managing remotely, Interacting with customers and patients and Organizing office spaces)\n\nSimultaneously, the continuity of our activities to serve industry and healthcare has been organized to ensure the best possible response to the needs of our customers and patients. Close contacts have been kept with our customers and patients to focus on their satisfaction, leveraging tools that had been rolled out recently, notably the Voice of the Customer program, which collects and analyzes customer opinion worldwide. With that open dialogue, the Group was able to maintain the presence of financial guidance throughout the year and continue to sign contracts with our customers.\n\nIn Healthcare especially, our teams are fully mobilized. Air Liquide provides medical gases to more than 15,000 hospitals and clinics, especially medical oxygen to treat covid-19 patients in intensive care. In areas where the virus has been particularly active, our production units have been running at full load and our technicians have been installing temporary oxygen tanks in hospitals or delivering cylinders on an ongoing basis to increase treatment capacities. During the spring of this year, faced with the urgent need for more ventilators in France and with the support of several French industrial companies, Air Liquide delivered at cost 10,000 units, the equivalent of three years of normal production. This industrial challenge followed our previous commitment to triple our ventilator production capacity. In Homecare, when in-person visits were not allowed, Air Liquide switched to digital visits and thus ensured the continuity of care for patients.\n\nAir Liquide strives to build long-lasting relationships with its suppliers, in an environment of mutual trust. This is why our French subsidiaries have been encouraged to pay cash invoices of less than 50,000 euros from small-size suppliers. In the same spirit, and in order to give priority to the companies which need it most, the Group has not benefited from any Government aids put in place in France to support the economy.\n\nIn response to the Health crisis, the Air Liquide Foundation launched as early as March 2020 the covid-19 Initiative. More than 2 million euros have been mobilized over two years, with a double objective: to support scientific research projects and to reinforce the help given to associations working with the most vulnerable people to covid-19. In an emergency context, the Foundation has already approved support to 10 scientific projects and 21 social emergency aid projects on all continents.",

The Group gets involved to protect the environment and to provide more competitive energy.\n\n## HEALTHCARE\n\nIn addition to oxygen supply to hospitals, Air Liquide became a specialist in the healthcare sector. The Group launched its Home Healthcare business and set up a dedicated network of specialized teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENERGY TRANSITION AND CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nOn November 30, 2018, Air Liquide announced its Climate Objectives, in particular a 30% reduction in its carbon intensity between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach that includes its assets, its customers, and ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MOBILIZATION OF THE GROUP AGAINST COVID-19\n\nThe Healthcare teams were highly mobilized to cope with the increasing demand for medical oxygen and ensure equipment supply such as respirators for hospitals.\n\nIn a context of global health and economic crisis, the Group has once again proven its resilience and the contribution of its activities to society.",

        "page_content": "## History of the Air Liquide group\n\n## HISTORY OF THE AIR LIQUIDE GROUP\n\nAir Liquide, a world leader in gases, technologies and services for industry and health, has been building its leadership since 1902.\n\n## 1902\n\n## ORIGIN\n\nAir Liquide was born of innovation and began with the encounter between two men: Georges Claude, inventor of an industrial process for the production of oxygen from liquid air, and Paul Delorme, a visionary entrepreneur.\n\n## 1906\n\n## FIRST INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nGas, by its very nature, is difficult to transport and thus local production is required. This was one of the reasons why Air Liquide set its sites internationally early on, building numerous production units abroad. Development was rapid in Europe (1906), Japan (1907), Canada (1911) and the United States (1916).\n\n## 1913\n\n## LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE\n\nThe critical role played by shareholders became evident in the first years of the Company's development. Listed on the Paris Stock Exchange in 1913, the share celebrated its hundredth-year of listing in 2013. Air Liquide has endeavored to forge a strong and privileged relationship with its shareholders based on exceptional stock market performance, with an average annual increase in its share price over the 100 years to 2013 of +11.9%.\n\n## 1952-1960\n\n## THE CRYOGENIC REVOLUTION\n\nStoring gas in liquid form in cryogenic tanks allows vast quantities to be transported by road or rail within a radius of approximately 200-250 km from the production site.\n\n## PIPELINE NETWORK STRATEGY\n\nBy delivering gas to several customers through pipelines, Air Liquide adopted a network strategy for the first time, linking its gas production units to one another. The Group increased its production capacity to meet soaring demand from large industries: firstly, for oxygen in the steel industry, and secondly, for nitrogen in chemicals. This marked the start-up of the Large Industries business.\n\n## 1962\n\n## SPACE INDUSTRY\n\nConvinced of the industrial potential of cryogenics, Jean Delorme, Chairman & CEO of Air Liquide, decided to create a research center near Grenoble dedicated to these technologies. The first applications were rapidly integrated in the space industry. Air Liquide has been a partner of the space adventure for 65 years.\n\n## 1970\n\n## A TRADITION OF INVENTIONS\n\nThe Claude Delorme Research Center, located on the Saclay plateau and now called the Innovation Campus Paris, was created. The research center's work is focused on enhancing gas production technologies and their applications. It is evidence of the Group's desire to better understand the industrial processes of its customers and develop new gas applications to better satisfy their requirements. Today, the Group also has Innovation Campuses in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n## 1985-1986\n\n## A NEW MARKET: ELECTRONICS\n\nIn Japan, the Group began to supply ultra-high purity gases to the semi-conductor industry: this involves carrier gases, mainly nitrogen, used to transport the specialty gases and keep the chip production tools inert, and specialty gases that are used directly in the manufacturing of semi-conductors. In 1987, Air Liquide inaugurated the Tsukuba Research Center in Japan, which is dedicated to the electronics industry.\n\n## MAJOR ACQUISITION\n\nThe Group acquired Big Three in the United States, a Large Industries business along the Gulf Coast.\n\n## 1995\n\n## EXTENDED OFFERING: HYDROGEN AND STEAM\n\nIn addition to oxygen and nitrogen, Air Liquide extended its offering to hydrogen and steam. To ensure the success of this new offering, the Group used its business model, which is behind the success of its air gas business, and deployed from the beginning a basin strategy based on a pipeline network, providing customers with flexibility, distribution reliability and service quality at the best price.",

        "page_content": "## HEALTHCARE\n\nOriginally an oxygen supplier to hospitals, Air Liquide became a specialist in the healthcare sector. The Group launched its Home Healthcare business and set up a dedicated network of specialist teams. Medical gases were progressively classified as drugs and manufacturers were required to file market authorizations. The Group also launched research programs in therapeutic gases, used for resuscitation and pain relief\n\n## 2000\n\n## INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION\n\nThe Group invested massively in China in the early 2000s; the country has been a major growth market for industrial gases and Air Liquide entered into numerous air gas contracts.\n\nThe Group acquired part of Messer Griesheim activities in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## 2007-2009\n\n## ORGANIZATION BY BUSINESS LINE\n\nThe Air Liquide growth drivers for the coming decades are based on changing lifestyles: industrial growth of developing economies, increasing energy needs and environmental challenges, healthcare and high technology. To capture this growth, the Group created a new organizational structure based on four World Business Lines. They combine the technical and operational expertise which are specific to each of the businesses of the Group - Large Industries, Industrial Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics - and centralize the specific market expertise.\n\nConscious of the strategic dimension of Engineering & Construction capabilities, the Group acquired Lurgi in 2007. This company provides Air Liquide with major proprietary technologies, notably hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units, adding to the Group's historical competencies in cryogenics.\n\n## RESILIENCE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS\n\nAffected by a global economic crisis of unprecedented magnitude, the Group focused its efforts on the management of its cash, costs, and investments (capital expenditures). Having tested the solidity of its long-term contracts, Air Liquide demonstrated the relevance of its business model. In a context of global recession, the Group showed itself to be an exception, posting a stable net profit while preserving the strength of its balance sheet.\n\n## History of the Air Liquide group\n\n## 2013-2015\n\n## NEW INITIATIVES IN THE INNOVATION FIELD - HYDROGEN ENERGY\n\nInnovation is central to Air Liquide's strategy. In 2013, Air Liquide launched two initiatives to promote open innovation: i-Lab (innovation Lab) and ALIAD, the Group's capital venture entity to take minority investments in innovative technology start-ups. In 2014, the Group decided on new investments such as the modernization of the Research Center near Versailles, on the Saclay plateau, the creation of a center for the development and industrialization of gas cylinders for industry and healthcare, and the launch of a technical center of excellence for cryogenic production technologies.\n\nIn addition, on a worldwide scale, Air Liquide actively contributes to the development of the hydrogen energy activity by supporting automotive manufacturers launching Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles on the market. Air Liquide contributes to the construction of hydrogen charging stations (United States, Japan, France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Korea).\n\n## 2016\n\n## AIRGAS ACQUISITION BY AIR LIQUIDE\n\nOn May 23, 2016, Air Liquide completed the acquisition of the American company Airgas. This acquisition was complementary to the Group's businesses in the United States and enabled Air Liquide to be present across all market segments both upstream of and downstream to the US market; this integration has created significant value.\n\nIn addition to the 300 million US dollars of synergies targeted by the Group through this acquisition, Air Liquide believes that the Airgas model, in terms of products, digitization of businesses, and business model, may be applied outside the United States.\n\nWith this acquisition, Air Liquide strengthens its position in the United States, the largest industrial gas market worldwide. This market also enjoys the strongest growth among advanced economies.\n\n## THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW COMPANY PROGRAM 2016-2020: NEOS\n\nThe Group acquired a new dimension following the acquisition of Airgas and thus entered a new phase of its development. On July 6, 2016, Air Liquide published its new mid-term company program, NEOS, for the 2016-2020 period.\n\nAir Liquide's strategy for profitable growth over the long-term is that of a customer-centric transformation. It is based on operational excellence and the quality of its investments, on open innovation and the network organization already implemented by the Group worldwide. Air Liquide's ambition is to be a leader in its industry, deliver long-term performance and contribute to sustainability.\n\n## CREATION OF THE GLOBAL MARKETS & TECHNOLOGIES BUSINESS\n\nTo step up the development of offerings in new markets, the Group created the Global Markets & Technologies business, responsible for developing new activities in the field of energy transition and the maritime sector, by leveraging technologies.",

        "page_content": "## History of the Air Liquide group\n\n## 2017\n\n## REFOCUSING ON GAS & SERVICES BUSINESSES\n\nFollowing the disposal of its Aqua Lung (diving) and Air Liquide Welding (welding) subsidiaries, Air Liquide focused on its Gas & Services businesses and the implementation of its NEOS company program. After these disposals, the share of Gas & Services revenue in Group sales increased to 90% in 2015 and 96% in 2018.\n\n## 2018\n\n## ENERGY TRANSITION AND CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nFor many years now, Air Liquide has been committed to sustainable growth aimed, in particular, at limiting its CO2 emissions and those of its customers. On November 30, 2018, Air Liquide announced its Climate Objectives, in particular a 30% reduction in its carbon intensity between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach that includes its assets, its customers, and ecosystems. These objectives are the most ambitious in the sector and are in line with the NEOS company program.\n\nIn this respect, the Global Markets & Technologies activity is stepping up sales to energy transition-related markets, driven by the biomethane sector with the start-up of several production units in Europe and the United States, and by hydrogen energy with the commissioning of new hydrogen charging stations for mobility. Moreover, the Hydrogen Council, which was founded in 2017, brings together more than 60 global leaders in the energy, transport and industry sectors to promote hydrogen with a view to achieving climate change-related objectives, and has held a meeting in China for the first time.\n\n## 2019\n\n## FINALIZATION OF THE INTEGRATION OF AIRGAS AND STRENGTHENING OF THE GROUP'S EFFICIENCY PROGRAM\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, Air Liquide reached its target of 300 million US dollars in synergies, thanks to the integration of Airgas, more than a year before initially planned. With the integration complete, Airgas joined the Group's efficiency program and contributes to increasing the annual target for efficiencies. This target was initially set at 300 million euros and was revised up, to more than 400 million euros, as of 2019. Moreover, a program aimed at promoting the sharing of the Airgas model has allowed close to 100 Group managers to immerse themselves in Airgas operations, to step up the sharing of its best practices with other Group regions.\n\n## INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF NEW HYDROGEN MARKETS\n\nAir Liquide acquired a stake in Canadian company Hydrogenics Corporation, a leader in electrolysis hydrogen production equipment, and announced the construction in Canada of the largest Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer in the world, aimed at producing hydrogen using hydro-power for industry and mobility usages.\n\nAir Liquide joined forces with its steel customers as part of a pioneering project to develop low-carbon steel production where hydrogen will be injected on a large scale to partially replace pulverized coal in the blast furnace, thus reducing emissions in the production process.\n\nOn the West Coast of the United States, Air Liquide took a stake in FirstElement Fuel, a leading hydrogen station operator in California. Air Liquide will invest 150 million US dollars in the production and liquefaction of carbon-free hydrogen through the partial use of biomethane.\n\n## 2020\n\n## MOBILIZATION OF THE GROUP AGAINST COVID-19\n\nThe Healthcare teams were highly mobilized to cope with the increasing demand for medical oxygen, supply equipment such as respirators for hospitals, ensure stabilized patients can return home and guarantee chronic patients are continually monitored. Faced with the pressing need for respirators to treat the patients most affected by covid-19, Air Liquide successfully led a French industrial partnership in order to produce 10,000 units in record time in response to a request by the French government. Moreover, Home Healthcare teams are mobilized to treat patients at their home in order to relieve pressure on hospitals.\n\nIn a context of global health and economic crisis, the Group has once again proven its resilience. This crisis has also highlighted the contribution of the Group's activities to society as well as the commitment of its employees.",

They represent 44% of Gas & Services revenue. Industrial Merchant is impacted by local industrial production momentum and consumer demand, whereas Electronics is linked to the semi-conductor sector.\n\nIn Large Industries, the supply of gas is contracted for a duration of 15 years, or more for specific projects, and includes take-or-pay clauses which guarantee a minimum level of revenue.\n\nUnderlying trends for the Healthcare business (longer life expectancy, more sedentary lifestyles, urbanization) ensure growth in demand which is decorrelated from economic cycles.\n\nIndustrial Merchant benefits from the broad diversity of its markets, customers, and regions which is the result of strategic targeting and which reinforces the resilience of the business line.\n\nThe development of the semi-conductor industry with its numerous digital applications is the main source of sales growth in Electronics, an industry which is maturing.\n\nThe Group's capacity to innovate enables it to continuously improve its current offerings by integrating new technologies and new ways of working to boost operational excellence. Air Liquide therefore draws on its internal and external innovation ecosystems to develop differentiating solutions for its customers and patients and open up new markets. Innovation contributes to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nIn addition to the Gas & Services businesses, Global Markets & Technologies help place Air Liquide in a pioneering position in new markets and new business models relating to energy transition and deep tech, thus accelerating the learning curve on new social and environmental challenges, and opening up key opportunities for future growth.\n\nFinally, the Engineering & Construction business line is responsible for the design and construction of plants and equipment to meet the various needs of the Group's business lines and third-party customers. Through its Engineering & Construction business line, the Group cultivates, shares and passes on its expertise from one generation to the next, ensuring both the continuity of its know-how and its continuous improvement thanks to the permanent integration of the latest technological advances and their adaptation to new markets.\n\nMoreover, through its various World Business Lines, the Group serves more than 3.8 million customers and patients in a variety of industries and across a wide range of regions, which provides high resistance to economic cycles. These characteristics, which are inherent to the industrial and healthcare gas business, reinforce the strength of the business model.",

Business overview\n\nThe Large Industries business line supplies gas and energy solutions to customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy industries, which are essential for their own core businesses, to improve process efficiency and to make their plants more environmentally friendly. The Large Industries business line provides oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen and carbon monoxide through its plants and its pipeline network. The Group also operates cogeneration plants to supply customers with steam and electricity.\n\nThe world leader in this sector, Air Liquide benefits from dedicated in-house development and engineering teams, differentiating proprietary technologies and rigorous processes for selecting investments and carrying out projects. The largest Large Industries customers are looked after by key account managers who have in-depth knowledge of customers' businesses, as well as of their projects, industrial processes and global structure. This allows Large Industries to maintain close contact with its customers, thus improving the Group's responsiveness and competitiveness in terms of meeting their needs.\n\n## 2020 LARGE INDUSTRIES REVENUE BY PRODUCT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 25% of Gas & Services revenue.\n\n## b. Business model\n\nThe supply of gas is generally contracted for 15 years. For certain projects, this can be extended to 20 years and beyond. The signing of new contracts for new industrial customers' sites is a strong predictor of future growth. Within these contracts, the Group guarantees long-term service continuity and a high level of reliability with respect to the gas supply via a high-performing industrial solution. In return, long-term gas supply contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through take-or-pay clauses, as well as the indexation to variable costs (mainly for electricity and natural gas) and to inflation.\n\nThe use of industrial gases is critical for the various industrial processes of Large Industries' customers. As any discontinuity in supply translates into an interruption of the customer's production operations, supply reliability and safety are crucial. However, although vital, gas supply generally represents a very small part of total production cost for the customer.\n\n## c. Large Industries industrial processes\n\nThe raw materials necessary for the production of industrial gases vary according to the type of gas and the location of the production unit. The production of oxygen and nitrogen requires air and a large quantity of electricity. Cogeneration units consume natural gas and water. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units mainly consume natural gas and little electricity. In 2019, the Group also launched the construction of the first electrolysis facilities that use water and electricity to produce hydrogen without releasing CO2. The energy and capital intensity of these industrial processes is generally high.\n\n## Air gases production (ASU: Air Separation Unit)\n\nAn ASU compresses, liquefies and distills air in order to separate it into its different components: 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon and noble gases (neon, krypton and xenon). Only certain large ASUs can produce rare gases. Electricity consumption is significant. A simplified diagram of an ASU operation is presented page 24.\n\n## Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production through steam reforming (SMR: Steam Methane Reformer)\n\nBy steam reforming natural gas, an SMR produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The most significant raw material is natural gas; electricity and water consumption is modest. A simplified diagram of a hydrogen unit's operation is presented page 23.\n\n## Hydrogen production through electrolysis\n\nHydrogen production through electrolysis is based on the dissociation of water molecules (H2O) using electricity, to extract hydrogen and oxygen molecules. This process produces hydrogen without using or emitting carbon-based molecules. It can be used to produce carbon-free hydrogen for industry and mobility, as well as for electricity storage. A simplified diagram of hydrogen production through electrolysis is presented page 23.\n\n## Cogeneration\n\nCogeneration consists of simultaneously and efficiently producing electricity and steam generally by consuming natural gas and water. The electricity is used by the plant or supplied to the local network, while the steam is required for certain industrial processes.",

Based on cryogenic distillation, separation membranes and amine-based processing, these technologies are used to capture the carbon dioxide generated by Air Liquide's industrial processes and those of its customers. These solutions can be installed, for example, at hydrogen production units, syngas facilities and in the blast furnaces of steel mills. Captured carbon dioxide is then used in the customer's processes, such as the treatment of alkaline water, or by Industrial Merchant customers, who use it for example to produce carbonated beverages, package food in a protective atmosphere, or in welding gas mixtures.\n\n## SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM OF THE OPERATION OF AN ELECTROLYZER\n\n<!-- image -->",

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS\n\nThe chemicals industry uses mainly oxygen, hydrogen and carbon monoxide in its manufacturing processes, as well as nitrogen to inert its installations.\n\nThe refining industry requires hydrogen to desulfurize fuels and crack heavy hydrocarbons. The demand for hydrogen is growing steadily due to more stringent legislation aimed at reducing emissions and the use of increasingly heavier hydrocarbons in fuel production.\n\nIn the metals industry, Air Liquide supplies large volumes of oxygen to steel producers notably, the use of which improves their energy performance and reduces significantly their CO2 emissions. The majority of new projects are currently located in developing economies. As part of Air Liquide's aim to offer solutions to its customers that will help them reduce their emissions, the Group is also taking part in a pilot project, with one of its steelmaking customers, which consists of injecting hydrogen at large scale to partially replace pulverized coal in blast furnaces, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the steel production process.\n\nNumerous industries linked to energy or chemicals use large quantities of oxygen to transform coal, natural gas or liquid hydrocarbons into syngas for the production of chemical products, synfuel or electricity.\n\nTo meet customer requirements, the supply of large quantities of gas is critical. Air Liquide supplies its customers directly by pipelines from a dedicated plant or different plants linked by a network. Air Liquide has built its pipeline networks progressively over the last 40 years. With a total length of more than 9,700 kilometers (6,000 miles), these networks stretch, for example, across Northern Europe, from Rotterdam through to Dunkirk, and along the Gulf Coast in the United States from Lake Charles (Louisiana) to Corpus Christi (Texas) as well as along the Mississippi in Louisiana. Many other mid-size local networks have also been built in other significant and fast-developing industrial basins in Germany, Italy, Singapore and, more recently, China.\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\nThe Large Industries business line depends on long-term contracts (15 to 20 years) which include take-or-pay clauses, offer considerable visibility of future revenue and protection in the event of a significant fall in customer volume consumption (below the minimum take-or-pay level). Sales prices in Large Industries contracts are indexed, in particular, to energy costs and to inflation. The long investment cycle and high capital intensity require a solid balance sheet. The signing of new contracts is a strong predictor of future growth.\n\nAir Liquide is developing a pipeline network strategy in the industrial basins in order to provide customers with greater supply reliability while optimizing operating costs. This strategy allows to mutualize production assets and generate savings, notably on energy, on the overall Air Liquide network as well as for its customers.",

Business overview\n\nThe Industrial Merchant business line is, by its nature, a highly local business, which provides more than two million customers with industrial gases, equipment, hardgoods and associated services.\n\nIndustrial Merchant provides gas using the supply mode best adapted to customers' needs: either via a small on-site production unit for customers with major volume requirements, or in liquid form distributed by trucks for medium-scale quantities, or in cylinders for smaller volumes and use on building sites. Around 95% of Industrial Merchant's customer base is small customers who favor simplicity, flexibility and quality of service: they mainly order cylinder gas and hardgoods.\n\nThe Industrial Merchant serves a wide variety of markets and is constantly inventing new applications for its molecules which address the challenges of new markets and help to improve the operational efficiency of its customers. The Industrial Merchant business manages a significant amount of data from the large number of assets used in operations along with the diversity of markets and customers. Digital transformation and data analysis therefore play a predominant role in improving operational efficiency and the quality of the services provided to the customers.\n\n## 2020 INDUSTRIAL MERCHANT REVENUE BY END-MARKET\n\n* 46% of Gas & Services revenue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## b. Business model\n\nA large share of Industrial Merchant sales is covered by contracts with terms of up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and up to 15 years for small on-site gas generators. These contracts generally include gas supply, the reliable and safe delivery of products and the provision by the Group of equipment at customers' sites, the provision of a service, as well as the indexation of the sales price to different variables such as inflation and fuel prices. The provision of cylinders\n\n## Business model\n\nor tanks at customers' sites is covered by a fixed monthly fee. The wide range of markets, customers and regions in which the Group is present reinforces the resilience of this business line.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Industrial Merchant (IM) business line is integrated in the industrial basins and firmly grounded in local economic life. This local base is strengthened by economic constraints which limit the radius of gas distribution to some 250 kilometers around a production site. One of the strengths of Industrial Merchant is to be able to identify high potential areas and establish a site by developing synergies with Large Industries' network of plants or by investing in dedicated units. While permeating the local economy, the Industrial Merchant business line has expanded its operations internationally in more than 73 countries, thus strengthening the business line's resilience. This regional diversity is based on a strategy of targeted investments and the regular optimization of portfolios.\n\nA permanent focus on geographic density within the industrial basins is a key success factor thanks to the synergies that this generates, in particular in terms of logistics. In addition to the business development of a basin, the acquisition of local distributors and their portfolio of customers also helps improve this density, in particular in markets that are still fairly fragmented such as in the United States and China.\n\n## c. Supply methods\n\nOn page 27, the diagram shows the different supply modes used in Industrial Merchant. Strong operational discipline is applied across the value chain (supply, packaging, distribution) and is an essential part of Air Liquide's integrated model. Coupled with new digital tools including the IBO ('Integrated Bulk Operations') application described on page 69, this allows the Group to optimize the use of its resources in real time (plants, trucks, energy, etc.) to improve the competitiveness of its products and services for customers and reduce its CO2 emissions. Air Liquide's quest for continuous improvement helps ensure the safety of its employees, customers and service providers and optimize their costs, while offering a first-class customer experience.",

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS\n\n## a. A customer-centric culture\n\nCustomers and markets served by Industrial Merchant are presented in the drawing on page 27. Industrial Merchant customers vary greatly in terms of size, business and needs, but their common ground is their desire for products and services which facilitate daily activities.\n\nThe Group's ambition to provide a first-class customer experience requires listening to customers' needs, providing a diversified and customized offering and an excellent quality of service. Air Liquide is therefore working on the rationalization and simplification of its processes to continuously improve the level of its service, focusing on the reliability of its equipment and deliveries and thus the overall efficiency of its supply chain.\n\nOptionality in terms of both product and service offering as well as transactional channel is also a differentiating characteristic of the Industrial Merchant business line. The integration of Airgas has boosted this customer-centric culture within the Group, both in terms of the excellence of operational service and the multi-channel sales approach. Airgas' know-how in telesales, e-commerce and its ability to integrate all channels, is currently being transferred to certain Group subsidiaries.\n\n## A MULTI-CHANNEL SALES APPROACH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DATA AND DIGITAL WORKING FOR THE CUSTOMER AND IMPROVING GROUP PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Industrial Merchant Business Line manages a significant amount of data from the large number of assets used in operations and the diversity of markets and customers. Digital transformation and data analysis therefore play a predominant role in improving operational efficiency, the quality of the services provided to the customers and new offerings. Thanks to data management, the Industrial Merchant teams are able to drive the performance of operations in real time, compare with other entities of the Group and reproduce best practices to improve value creation. The digitalization of assets on customer sites also enables the uploading of utilization data, which is then analyzed to create new services, offerings or business models.\n\n## b. A strategic positioning on markets with optimized product portfolios\n\nThanks to their proximity to customers and the Group's presence in a large number of markets, the Industrial Merchant teams foster a large and in-depth knowledge of the latter and of their industrial processes. Moreover, Air Liquide collects a large amount of data from these markets and the economy in general. This allows the Group to identify major trends, assess growth prospects and anticipate future opportunities. By closely analyzing this market data and their value chains, the Group has developed a selective approach and dynamic market management to focus its resources on areas of\n\nhigher potential growth. The diversity of the markets, customers and geographical regions resulting from strategic targeting strengthens the resilience of the business line.\n\nThe level of profitability of the Industrial Merchant business line varies according to product and supply mode. By optimizing this product and customer mix , the business increases its profitability, captures new volumes and diversifies its customer base.",

        "page_content": "## Business model\n\n## 4. Competition\n\nAt a global level, the industrial gases industry comprises three main players: Air Liquide and Linde Plc (Ireland), co-market leaders with sales in excess of 20 billion euros each, and Air Products (United States) with revenue which is more than two times lower. Linde Plc is the new entity following the merger of equals between two global players, Linde AG (Germany) and Praxair (United States), which was completed in October 2018. There are also a number of global and regional players, such as Taiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan), Messer (Germany), Yingde (China), Air Water (Japan) and Hangzhou Oxygen Plant Group (China). Finally, numerous smaller-sized players are also present in local markets.\n\nIn Large Industries, the customer can choose between self-production and over-the-fence gas supply. Self-production is currently estimated to account for 90% of hydrogen production and 60% of oxygen production globally, although with significant geographical disparities. Companies self-producing gas represent an important market share for the Group to address. In this respect, the potential to convert self-production into over-the-fence supply represents a major growth opportunity for the Large Industries business. The level of self-production varies strongly depending upon the geographic region, type of industry or local culture. In advanced economies, the supply of oxygen is largely over-the-fence, while the supply of hydrogen for refining remains primarily in-house. In developing economies, while relatively new, over-the-fence supply is accelerating significantly. Air Liquide, the world leader in Large Industries, is in competition with the other major global players and local players.\n\nIndustrial Merchant is a local business: transport costs limit the operating area to within 200 to 250 km of a production unit, except for\n\nhigh value-added gases such as argon and helium. This market, which is highly diversified due to the size and activity of its customers, thus includes numerous small and medium-sized local competitors, either ensuring gas production and distribution, or solely distributing gas.\n\nIn Healthcare, most gas industry players also supply hospitals with medical oxygen, but few are present in the treatment of chronic diseases at home. In Home Healthcare, Air Liquide is number one in Europe, whereas Linde Plc has a larger presence in the United States. This market remains fragmented in almost all regions with a multitude of small companies and associations. This fragmentation provides bolt-on acquisition opportunities.\n\nFinally, in Electronics, five companies play a major role: Air Liquide, Linde Plc, Merck KGaA (Germany), Air Products and Taiyo Nippon Sanso. Air Liquide is the leader in this industry.\n\nIn Engineering & Construction, Air Liquide also competes with industrial gas players. In 'cold' technologies used for air gas separation, the main competitors are Linde Plc, Hangzhou Hangyang (China), Kaifeng (China) and Air Products. Chinese competitors are gaining ground due to strong demand in their country. In 'hot' technologies used for producing hydrogen and the chemical conversion of syngas, the largest competitors are Technip (France), Haldor Topsoe (Denmark) and Linde Plc.\n\nGlobal Markets & Technologies is growing worldwide, on growth markets such as those relating to energy transition and the climate along with deep tech. The competitive landscape varies greatly from market to market, with companies of various sizes: from multinationals to start-ups.",

NEOS company program and mid-term objectives\n\nThe NEOS company program provides a framework to build a Group which is sustainably more efficient, more connected to its stakeholders and more innovative. This program has two series of objectives: financial as well as societal and environmental. Due to the public health crisis and the unprecedented economic environment in 2020 which has had a major impact on sales growth as well as on costs and investment management, the Group believes that including 2020 results in the assessment of its medium-term performance is not relevant.\n\nAs a result, the achievement of the financial objectives set out in the NEOS program initially planned to cover the 2016-2020 period was terminated early at the end of 2019, except for the ROCE target which had been set for a longer period of time. Over 2016-2019, all of the objectives were achieved. A new five-year company program should be announced during the first quarter of 2022 and will cover the 2021-2025 period, using 2021 as its reference year.\n\n## 2.1. ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES\n\nThe financial aims of the NEOS company program are based on the following four objectives.\n\n+6% to +8% CAGR 2016-2020 (a)\n\nROCE >10% In 2021-2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a)  Including Airgas scope effect in 2017 corresponding to a +2% CAGR.\n- (b)  Over the 2017-2020 period.\n\nThe compound average annual growth rate (CAGR) of revenue over the 2016-2019 period was +6.5% and +7.8% excluding the currency impact, of which +2% was related to the Airgas acquisition. This was in line with the target of +6% to +8% between 2016 and 2020 including the Airgas impact.\n\nThe initial target of 300 million US dollars in cumulated synergies relating to the Airgas acquisition was reached during the first quarter of 2019, one year before the initial date. Furthermore, in 2019, the Group raised its initial target of 300 million euros in efficiencies to 400 million euros. More than 1.1 billion euros in cumulated efficiencies were therefore achieved over 2017-2019, largely exceeding the initial target.\n\nAir Liquide maintained its 'A' rating for the entire period. The net debt-to-equity ratio, which was initially above 150% following the Airgas acquisition, stood at 64.0% at the end of 2019. This sharp reduction in debt was recognized by the Standard & Poors rating agency which published a positive outlook on the Group.\n\nMoreover, the Group also maintained its level of investment at between 10% and 12% of sales during the period, in line with guidance.\n\nThe Group had set a ROCE target of more than 10% for 2021-2022, but the covid-19 pandemic is very likely to have an impact of more than one year on net profit growth. Furthermore, in preparation for future growth, Air Liquide has decided to step up its investments despite the\n\nEfficiencies >\u20ac300m on average/year (b) Increased to >\u20ac400m since 2019 + Airgas synergies >$300m\n\nMaintain 'A' range rating\n\npublic health crisis, in particular those related to the energy transition. The Group therefore maintains its ROCE target of more than 10% and has rescheduled its achievement to 2023 or 2024, depending on when the covid-19 crisis will end.\n\nA new five-year company program should be announced during the first quarter of 2022 and will cover the 2021-2025 period, using 2021 as its reference year.\n\n## 2.2. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL OBJECTIVES\n\nThe NEOS company program includes sustainable development objectives which support the Group's strategy and contribute to its long-term performance.\n\n## 2.2.1. Environmental objectives\n\n## CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nReduce carbon intensity by 30% (a) by 2025 (4.4), based on 2015 emission levels (6.3).\n\n(a)  In kg CO2-equivalent/euro of operating income recurring before depreciation and amortization at 2015 exchange rate and excluding IFRS 16 for greenhouse gas emissions scopes 1 and 2 (see reconciliation in the appendix to Chapter 1, page 57.

        "page_content": "## Strategy and objectives\n\n## 2.2.2. Strengthening dialog with stakeholders\n\nStrengthening dialog with Group employees, customers and patients, shareholders, suppliers, local communities and the public sphere is a strategic objective which contributes directly to the responsible growth that the Group seeks to implement. Through these ongoing discussions, the Group is committed to take into account their issues, identify priority development issues and share its ambition to contribute to a more sustainable world.\n\nTo strengthen the dialog with its stakeholders and respond to regulatory changes, Air Liquide updated the materiality matrix of its Sustainable Development stakes in 2020. Thus, 21 stakes covering environmental, corporate, societal, economic, Human Rights and governance aspects were submitted for analysis by the Group's stakeholders: employees, shareholders, investors, members of the public sphere, customers, patients, etc.\n\nNearly 1,400 returns were collected, compiled and analyzed to constitute Air Liquide's materiality matrix of Sustainable Development stakes shown on page 322. The purpose of this matrix is to integrate the main risks and opportunities into the Group's strategy according to the importance allocated to them by the various stakeholders. At this point, the Group would like to extend its thanks to the contributors to this analysis which will allow it to move its Sustainable Development program forward and the involvement of its stakeholders in this strategic area.\n\n## 3. Strategy governance\n\n## 3.1. ORGANIZATION\n\nVarious internal structures contribute to the definition and implementation of the Group's strategy. Their roles are presented in Chapter 2 'Risk factors and control environment', page 73.\n\nSIR meetings (Strategic Investment Review) are chaired by the Chairman and CEO in order to periodically review the Group's strategy, major investments and policies. The Executive Committee meets on a regular basis to review the strategy and its implementation.\n\nMoreover, monthly meetings of the Group Performance Steering Committee are held to establish investment budgets and the action plans to undertake or amend in order to achieve the annual or multi-annual objectives.\n\nFinally, investments are validated through the Resources and Investment Committees (RIC), the operation of which is described on page 41 of this Chapter.\n\nTaking environmental and societal challenges into account are also an integral part of the Group's strategy. The Sustainable Development Department, which reports to an Executive Vice President, thus contributes to the development of the strategy and defines the specific measures to be included in the NEOS company program. Moreover, this Executive Vice President takes part in the above-mentioned meetings and contributes their sustainable development vision.\n\n## 3.2. INVESTMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group's steady long-term growth is largely due to its ability to invest in new projects each year. Investment projects in the industrial gas business are spread throughout the world, highly capital intensive and supported by long-term contracts, in particular for Large Industries. Air Liquide has thus tailored its financing to the nature of its projects, based on the diversification of financing sources, the prudent management of the balance sheet and innovative financing methods. This financing policy is fundamental for the Group's continued development.\n\n## HUMAN RESOURCES OBJECTIVES\n\n35% of women among Group managers and professionals\n\n33% of young graduates among managers and professional recruitments by 2025.\n\n## New model for employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur environment is characterized by an accelerated change in society and economy through digitalization, rapid technological\n\ndevelopment, aging of the active population and new enterprise models. For example, new generations have higher priorities with regard to their working environment (search for meaning, forms of apprenticeship, flexibility at work). The environment is uncertain and, at the same time, the search for sustainability is essential.\n\nFrom a co-creation bringing together more than 700 employees, Air Liquide is changing its working methods within the company, not only to meet today's requirements, but also those of tomorrow while remaining true to its fundamental principles. To this end, in 2020 the Group rolled out its new model entitled Be Act Engage which allows its employees to develop within a safe, ethical and committed environment in order to deliver sustainable performance.\n\nThe Group's investments reflect its growth strategy. They can be classified into two categories:\n\n- \u25a0 industrial investments, which bolster organic growth and guarantee the efficiency, replacement, maintenance and safety of installations;\n- \u25a0 financial investments, which strengthen existing positions, or accelerate penetration into a new region or business segment through the bolt-on acquisition of companies or assets already in operation, as well as new technologies.\n\nThe nature of industrial investments differs from one World Business Line to the next: from gas production units for Large Industries and Electronics, to filling centers, logistics equipment, storage facilities, medical devices and management systems for Industrial Merchant, Electronics and Healthcare. The nature of investments is also highly varied within Global Markets & Technologies. Capital intensity varies greatly from one business to another. Capital intensity varies greatly from one business to another.\n\n## CLIMATE AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS\n\nFor all its major projects, Air Liquide includes an internal carbon price of 50 euros per ton of CO2 in its investment decision process. This is a value that Air Liquide voluntarily sets for itself to assess the economic cost of greenhouse gases emissions. The analysis of investments with this internal carbon price ensures the robustness and sustainability of the customer project: for major projects, the potential costs associated with a possible tax on CO2 emissions from Group's assets are reflected in the price of industrial gases and paid by the customer. This analysis also makes it possible to validate the relevance and viability of the investment solution planned by Air Liquide and to propose low-carbon technological solutions, whenever possible.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.1. Capital intensity\n\nCapital intensity is the ratio of capital required to generate one euro of supplementary revenue, when projects or businesses reach maturity. This capital is either invested in industrial assets (production units, storage facilities, logistics equipment, etc.), or used as working capital to finance the development of the activities.\n\nCapital intensity varies significantly from one business to another:\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries:\n- - air gases production has a capital intensity of around 3. It varies with the trend in electricity prices,\n- - hydrogen and cogeneration have a capital intensity of between 1.5 and 2, due to the high proportion of natural gas in the cost of sales. This capital intensity therefore varies with the changes in natural gas and electricity prices;\n\n## Strategy and objectives\n\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant capital intensity to launch the business in a new market is between 1.5 and 2;\n- \u25a0 Electronics has an average capital intensity of around 2.5;\n- \u25a0 in Healthcare, capital intensity, excluding acquisitions, is around 1 depending on the product mix.\n\nThe Group's capital intensity therefore continues to vary depending on the business mix, project type and prices of raw materials. It is much higher for renewal and efficiency investments.\n\nWhatever the capital intensity, any project must enable the Group to achieve its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) objective over the long term. Therefore, for the same level of return on investment, the operating margin (OIR to revenue ratio) of a project will depend on the capital intensity of the activity in which the project is carried out.\n\n## 3.2.2. The theoretical lifespan of gas production unit contracts\n\nLong-term development is one of the key characteristics of the Industrial Gas business. It is particularly evident in the investment cycle, where there is approximately a five-year span between the study of a new construction project for a Large Industries customer and the first corresponding industrial gas sales. Investment cycles in\n\nother business lines are generally shorter. Monitoring the lifespan of these projects is essential to anticipating the Group's future growth. The chart below provides details of each stage of this process based on the example of a Large Industries contract.\n\n## INVESTMENT CYCLE OF A LARGE INDUSTRIES CONTRACT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApplying a theoretical capital intensity of 2, an investment of 100 million euros in a new project should generate 50 million euros of sales per annum, when fully ramped-up.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy and objectives\n\n- \u25a0 Opportunities and Negotiation phase: the project is included in the portfolio of investment opportunities and enters into the development process. Projects exceeding 5 million euros of investment for Large Industries and exceeding 3 million euros for other business lines are monitored within the portfolio of potential opportunities and split between those for which a decision is expected within 12 months and those for which the investment decision will take more than one year. Projects are then discussed and negotiated with the customer. Projects can be removed from the portfolio for several reasons:\n- 1.  the contract is signed, it is removed from the portfolio and therefore becomes an investment decision;\n- 2.  the project is abandoned by the customer;\n- 3.  the customer decides against an over-the-fence gas supply or the project is awarded to a competitor;\n- 4.  the project is delayed beyond 12 months: it is removed from the 12-month portfolio but remains in the long-term portfolio.\n\n## 3.2.3. Governance of major growth projects\n\nThree Air Liquide entities are at the heart of major growth projects, from development through to its execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe business line involved ensures the global customer relationship is monitored, provides the required know-how and ensures the overall consistency of the project, in terms of both contract and technical standards. It is also responsible for good internal governance practices.\n\nThe local subsidiary proposes the project and, once the contract has been signed, carries the investment on its balance sheet. It is then responsible for operations, customer relations and the project's financial profitability.\n\nEngineering & Construction provides the technologies and guarantees that they are competitive, both overall and specifically for each project thanks to a good industrial architecture solution. Engineering & Construction is responsible for the technical aspect and works with local Capital Implementation site management assistance teams (CI within the hubs) which are responsible for executing the project.\n\n- \u25a0 Signature phase: the two parties reach an agreement. The signing of a long-term contract represents an investment decision validated by the internal governance bodies. The project is removed from the portfolio of investment opportunities and is registered in current investments.\n- \u25a0 Construction phase: the construction of the unit generally takes around 24 months and sometimes up to 36 months depending on the size of the project. This is the capital expenditure period. The project remains in current investments.\n\n## \u25a0 Revenue phase:\n\n- 1.  commissioning: this corresponds to the start-up of the unit. Sales reflect the needs of the customer with a guaranteed minimum volume at the take-or-pay level, guaranteeing minimum profitability from the beginning of the contract;\n- 2.  ramp-up: this is the unit's ramp-up phase. Over the course of the contract term, volumes increase above the take-or-pay level to the nominal amount defined in the contract. Nominal capital intensity is achieved only at the end of this phase.\n\nPotential projects are identified well in advance, based on good market knowledge and a strong local presence. The first stage includes selecting the opportunities in which the Group would like to invest both commercial and technical resources, in line with its global strategy. This selection process is followed by a series of validation stages.\n\nDuring the development stage, the project is submitted for the approval of the geographic region on which it depends. At the Group level, two major bodies validate the relevance of the project: the RIC (Resources & Investment Committee - see below page 41) which is responsible for assessing and validating investment requests, and the ERC (Engineering Risk Committee) which is responsible for assessing technical and execution risk.\n\nOnce the project has been decided on by Air Liquide and signed with the customer, it is executed by a team composed of representatives of the investing subsidiary and of Engineering & Construction, under the supervision of the geographic hub.\n\nThe type, complexity, geography and size of investment opportunities have changed significantly during recent years. A dedicated CIG (Capital Implementation Group) made up of experts strengthens the team in charge of executing investments.\n\nDuring the start-up of a unit, project management is the responsibility of the local operational teams, under strict standards to ensure the site's security and integrity. The operational management of the unit is carried out by the local subsidiary, and the Group and hub's Operations Control monitors its financial performance.",

The following criteria are systematically reviewed:\n\n- \u25a0 the location of the project: the analysis will take into account whether the project is based in an industrial basin with high potential, whether it is connected to an existing pipeline network, or whether it is in an isolated location;\n- \u25a0 the competitiveness of the customer's site: based on size, production processes and particularly their environmental footprint, cost of raw materials and access to markets;\n- \u25a0 customer risk;\n- \u25a0 exposure to the risk of corruption;\n- \u25a0 contract clauses;\n- \u25a0 end products and the stability of future demand for these products;\n- \u25a0 quality and risk related to the technical solution;\n- \u25a0 country risk: evaluated on a case-by-case basis and can lead to changes in the financing policy and its supplementary insurance cover;\n- \u25a0 Social and Environmental Responsibility criteria, in particular relating to greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and relations with local communities;\n- \u25a0 the compatibility of projects with the Group's Climate Objectives, based on a minimum of 50 euros per ton of CO2-equivalent for the cost of a project's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFollowing approval by the RIC and signing with the customer, the project is transferred to the current investment category.\n\n## INVESTMENT CYCLE DEFINITIONS\n\n## Investment opportunities at the end of the period\n\nCumulative value of investment opportunities taken into account by the Group for a decision within the next 12 months.

FINANCING\n\nThe financing policy is regularly reviewed to provide the best possible support to the Group's development and take into account changes in financial market conditions, while respecting a credit profile in line with Standard & Poor's and Moody's long-term minimum 'A' category rating. This credit profile depends on key ratios such as net debt to equity and cash flow from operating activities after change in working capital requirements to net debt.\n\nThe Air Liquide Group applies the following principles of prudence:\n\n- \u25a0 pursuing the diversification of financing sources and spreading of debt maturities in order to minimize refinancing risk;\n- \u25a0 backing commercial paper issues with confirmed credit facilities;\n- \u25a0 hedging interest rate risk to ensure visibility of financing costs, in line with long-term investment decisions;\n- \u25a0 funding investments in the currency of the operating cash flows, to ensure a natural currency hedging;\n- \u25a0 a permanent centralization of funding and excess cash through Air Liquide Finance, a wholly-owned entity of Air Liquide.\n\n## 3.3.1. Diversifying and securing financing sources\n\nAir Liquide diversifies its financing sources by accessing various debt markets: commercial paper, bonds and banks.\n\nAir Liquide uses the short-term commercial paper market, in France, through two French Commercial Paper programs of up to an outstanding maximum of 3 billion euros each, and in the United States through a US Commercial Paper program (USCP) of up to an outstanding maximum of 2 billion US dollars.\n\nFor its long-term financing, Air Liquide has a Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program to issue long-term bonds of up to an outstanding maximum amount of 12 billion euros. This program allows, in particular, for bonds to be issued in the principal currencies (euro, US dollar, Japanese yen) as well as in other currencies (Chinese renminbi, Swiss franc, pound sterling and Russian ruble).\n\nThe Group also raises funds through bank debt (loans and credit facilities).\n\nTo avoid liquidity risk relating to the renewal of funding at maturity, and in accordance with the Group's internal policy, the Group limits its short-term debt maturities to an amount which is covered by committed credit facilities from its core banks.\n\nInvestments are generally funded in the currency in which the cash flows are generated, creating a natural currency hedge.\n\n## 3.3.2. Centralization of cash and funding, excess cash and hedging\n\nTo benefit from economies of scale and facilitate capital markets financing (bonds and commercial paper), the Group uses a dedicated subsidiary, Air Liquide Finance. This subsidiary centralizes the vast majority of the Group's financing transactions. It hedges currency, interest rate and energy risk for the Group's subsidiaries in those countries where it is permitted by law.\n\nIn the countries where local regulations permit, Air Liquide Finance also centralizes cash flow balances through direct or indirect daily cash pooling of these outstanding balances or through intra-group loans and borrowings. When daily international cash concentration is not possible, there exist, nonetheless, local cash poolings which allow periodic intercompany loans to Air Liquide Finance.\n\nDue to the currency matching within Air Liquide Finance, resulting from the currency hedging of intra-group loans and borrowings, these internal financing transactions do not generate a foreign exchange risk for the Group.\n\nAir Liquide Finance, which centralizes the Group's financial hedging transactions, complies with EMIR requirements (European Market Infra-structure Regulation) relating to its status as a non-financial counterparty (NFC) and ensures risk mitigation and derivative transaction reporting are in line with technical standards published by ESMA.\n\nFurthermore, in certain specific cases (e.g. regulatory constraints, high country risk, joint ventures, etc.), the Group may limit its risk though adapted management, by setting up specific financing in the local banking market, and by using credit risk insurance.\n\n## 3.3.3. Staggering debt maturity schedules\n\nTo minimize the refinancing risk related to debt maturity schedules, the Group spreads maturities over several years.\n\nDebt maturity schedules are regularly reviewed by Executive Management.\n\nRefinancing risk is also reduced by the regularity of the cash flow generated from Group activities.\n\n## 3.3.4. Use of bank guarantees\n\nGroup subsidiaries require from time to time bank guarantees, mostly in favor of Healthcare, Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies, either during the tender period (bid bond), or after contract award, during contract execution until the end of the warranty period (advance payment bond, retention bond, performance bond, and warranty bond).\n\nThe most common bank guarantees are advance payment bonds and performance bonds and are extended to customers to secure contractual performance.\n\nIn the Group's ordinary course of business, certain subsidiaries are required to provide financial payment guarantees to secure rental or insurance obligations.\n\nThe projects, for which these guarantees are granted, are regularly reviewed by management and are subject to approval by the Board of Directors for guarantees which exceed 100 million euros. When guarantee payment calls become probable, the necessary provisions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.",

The business model thus demonstrated its robustness, supported by the Group's global presence and the diversity and balance of its portfolio between growth businesses and resilient sectors. Engineering & Construction consolidated revenue, which was down -23% over the year, enjoyed a strong +24.1% increase in the 4 th quarter. Global Markets & Technologies was up +6.0%, with a dynamic momentum in biogas with the start-up of new units. Group revenue as published was down -6.5% due to negative currency (-2.0%), energy (-1.8%), and significant scope (-1.4%) impacts.\n\n## Gas & Services\n\nGas & Services revenue totaled 19,656 million euros , very close to 2019 on a comparable basis, at -1.2% . Healthcare and Electronics sales enjoyed growth during each quarter of 2020, despite the public health and economic crisis. Healthcare was fully committed to ensuring the supply of oxygen to hospitals to treat covid-19 patients and posted significant growth of +8.5% for 2020. Electronics also recorded a very solid growth of +3.9% and +7.9% excluding Equipment & Installations sales. Large Industries sales remained stable at -0.1% despite the public health context, mainly driven by the contribution from the start-up and ramp-up of new production units, and the quick return to growth of certain developing economies including China. Industrial Merchant sales were down -6.3%, negatively impacted by the crisis but supported by solid pricing impacts of +2.6% and growth in developing economies including China and Eastern Europe. Sales as published were down -6.6% in 2020, affected by unfavorable currency (-2.1%), energy (-1.9%) and significant scope (-1.4%) impacts. The significant scope impact reflects mainly the disposal of Sch\u00fclke in Healthcare and the reduction or disposal of the Group's stakes in several non-strategic distributors in Japan during the 2 nd half of the year, as well as the disposal of Fujian Shenyuan units in September 2019.\n\n## Performance",

In North America, after being strongly hit by the pandemic during the 2 nd quarter, sales started improving sequentially in the 3 rd quarter but remained down compared with 2019. Sales were up markedly in Latin America in 2020, mainly driven by a start-up in Large Industries in Argentina and strong demand for medical oxygen. Large Industries revenue in the region was up +1.4%. Industrial Merchant saw a strong sequential recovery over the 2 nd half of the year, but annual revenue remained down by -7.1%. Healthcare is still fully committed to the fight against the pandemic notably with the supply of medical oxygen, and posted annual sales growth of +7.7%. Electronics posted solid growth of +5.2%.\n\n## AMERICAS GAS & SERVICES 2020 REVENUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries revenue was up +1.4% over 2020.

Sales were up significantly in Latin America in 2020, mainly driven by the start-up of a unit in Argentina and strong air gas demand during the 4 th quarter in Brazil and Argentina.\n\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant sales (-7.1%) were impacted by the public health crisis, but enjoyed a strong sequential improvement starting in the 3 rd quarter. The slowdown was partly offset by high pricing impacts of +3.6% over the year. The contribution from helium gradually declined and represented less than 15% of pricing impacts during the 4 th quarter. Sales were up in the Food, Pharmaceuticals, Research, and Retail & Craftsmen markets during the 4 th quarter, whereas sales in industrial sectors such as Metal Fabrication and Automotive remained down despite a gradual recovery during the 2 nd half of the year. In the United States and Canada, gas volumes, in particular cylinders, were up markedly during the 2 nd half of the year following a major decline during the 2 nd quarter at the peak of the public health crisis. In Latin America, revenues were up over the year with a good momentum for liquid gas sales in Brazil and Argentina during the 4 th quarter, notably to the Metal Fabrication sector.\n- \u25a0 Healthcare revenue was up +7.7% in 2020 with medical liquid oxygen and hospital installations sales up significantly across the region, in particular during the 2 nd wave of the covid-19 pandemic in the 4 th quarter. In the United States, proximity care recovered quickly following a marked decline during the 2 nd quarter due to the interruption of elective care at the peak of the pandemic. In 2020, Home Healthcare enjoyed strong growth in Latin America across all therapies and recovered gradually in Canada following a material slowdown during the 2 nd quarter.\n- \u25a0 Electronics revenue was up +5.2% over the year, with an increase in Carrier Gases sales and excellent momentum for Equipment & Installation sales.",

Industrial activities, which were particularly affected by the public health crisis from mid-March, started to recover from the beginning of May and markedly accelerated its recovery during the second half of the year. Large Industries sales were down by -1.0% over the year. Industrial Merchant recovered during the 2 nd half of the year, but its annual revenue, which was down -5.6%, remains impacted by the public health crisis.

This strategic investment demonstrates Air Liquide's long-term commitment to hydrogen energy and its ambition to be a major player in the supply of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, in order to contribute to the decarbonization of the industry and mobility markets.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide announced an investment of 125 million euros in July to build the first world-scale Air Separation Unit (ASU) for oxygen production with an energy storage system that helps facilitate more renewable energy on the electricity grid due to its grid stabilizing capability. This highly efficient plant, with circa 10% less electricity consumption , will have a production capacity of 2,200 tons of oxygen per day , and will be built in Port of Moerdijk in the Netherlands . This project illustrates Air Liquide's strategy to grow in strategic industrial basins, and the Group's ability to design and implement innovative solutions contributing to the energy transition , in line with its Climate Objectives .\n\n## Performance\n\nyear, driven notably by the recovery in the automotive sector in Germany. Hydrogen volumes for refineries remained down, impacted by several customer turnarounds during the 4 th quarter and a slowdown in activity linked to weaker demand for transportation fuels. Sales in Eastern Europe were up in 2020, and particularly over the 4 th quarter thanks to an increased demand for air gases in Poland and Finland, and a one-off sale in Russia.\n\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant revenue was down -5.6% in 2020. The entire region was affected by the public health crisis starting in the 1 st quarter, in particular Western and Southern Europe, but gas sales recovered rapidly, in particular cylinders sales which returned to levels similar to 2019 during the 2 nd half of 2020. Sales to the Automotive, Metal Manufacturing, Materials, Energy, and Retail and Craftsmen sectors saw a return to growth in the 4 th quarter. Momentum was good in Eastern Europe, in particular in the 4 th quarter, with strong growth in gas volumes, notably in liquid form, in Poland, Russia and Turkey. Pricing impacts remained solid at +1.7% for 2020.\n- \u25a0 Healthcare has been very involved in the fight against covid-19 and posted an improvement of +9.7% over 2020. Medical Gases sales remained high, in particular during the 4 th quarter. The business line was also supported by exceptional ventilator sales at cost price and exceptionally strong demand for medical equipment due to the pandemic. Home Healthcare saw a return to a more dynamic growth during the 2 nd half of the year, following the slowdown in new homecare installations during the 2 nd quarter at the peak of the pandemic. This was notably driven by the contribution from new bolt-on acquisitions and the increase in the number of patients treated for diabetes at home in Scandinavia, Germany, and in the Iberian peninsula.",

Within this context, Air Liquide leveraged the start-up in 2020 of its fourth hydrogen and carbon monoxide unit in this major industrial complex to increase by 20% the contractual volumes dedicated to BASF.\n\n## Middle East & Africa\n\nRevenue in the Middle East & Africa reached 564 million euros , down -2.6% over 2020. Following a customer turnaround at a large hydrogen production unit at the beginning of the year, Large Industries sales were up during the 2 nd half of the year, in particular in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and South Africa. Industrial Merchant revenue, which was strongly\n\nhit by the covid-19 crisis during the 2 nd quarter, recovered during the 3 rd quarter and saw a return to growth during the 4 th quarter driven by good momentum in India and Egypt. Africa remained sluggish. Healthcare is committed to the fight against covid-19 and posted strong growth across the region.\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries sales were up slightly over the year ( +0.2% ), driven mainly by strong demand in oxygen for Steel and Chemicals in China in the 2 nd half and the ramp-up of a hydrogen unit in South Korea. At the end of the year, oxygen volumes in China were higher than in 2019 but the recovery was slower in the rest of the region, in particular in Japan where volumes remained weak. In the 4 th quarter, hydrogen and carbon monoxide sales were impacted by customer maintenance turnarounds in China. This was partially offset by strong demand for hydrogen for refining in Singapore.\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant revenue was down -3.6% over the year, due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. The region saw a return to growth during the 4 th quarter. This was driven by China which posted a strong sales increase of +9.9% over the quarter and of +3.6% for the year, with a marked increase in cylinder gas sales and gas produced on site in particular. Momentum across the rest of the region remained slower due to the public health crisis, in particular in Japan and Singapore, but has seen a sequential improvement during the second half of the year. Sales were up in the Research, Metal Manufacturing, and Retail & Craftsmen markets in the region and pricing impacts were stable across the year.\n- \u25a0 Electronics sales for 2020, which were up +3.6% , posted marked growth of +10.7% excluding Equipment & Installation sales, which had been particularly high during the 1 st half of 2019. This growth was driven by Advanced Materials and Carrier Gases with, in particular, the ramp-up of an Advanced Materials supply contract in South Korea and of several Carrier Gases production plants in China, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore.",

        "page_content": "## Engineering & Construction\n\nConsolidated Engineering & Construction revenue stood at 250 million euros for 2020, supported by a substantial +24% increase in the 4 th quarter driven by the sale of technology licenses and the progress of major third-party projects. Third-party customer sales were down -23% over the year, reflecting the slowdown due to the public health crisis and the allocation of resources to internal projects in Large Industries and Electronics. Total sales, which includes intra-group sales, saw a more moderate decline of -9% for the year.\n\nOrder intake for the 4 th quarter increased markedly and reached 820 million euros in 2020, an amount comparable to 2019. This confirms the efforts made by the sales teams and the postponement until the end of the year of certain projects due to the public health crisis. More than half of orders are for projects in Asia. These mainly relate to Air Separation Units and ultra-pure nitrogen production units, with orders for the Group very slightly exceeding those for third-party customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GLOBAL MARKETS & TECHNOLOGIES\n\n- \u25a0 One of the leading retailers in the United Kingdom, ASDA, has contracted Air Liquide to install and operate six biomethane (BioNGV) distribution stations to refuel trucks on its sites. Alongside other investments to increase Air Liquide's production and distribution capacities, this major contract marks a significant acceleration in the Group's development of its biomethane activity in the UK.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide announced the construction of its first two biomethane production units in Italy , recycling organic material from agricultural and livestock activities to convert it into biomethane, a renewable energy source. These investments to support the circular economy are in line with Air Liquide's Climate Objectives , and contribute to the development of a low carbon society .\n\n## OPERATING INCOME RECURRING\n\nOperating income recurring before depreciation and amortization totaled 5,928 million euros , stable ( -0.1% ) compared with 2019. Personnel costs were down -3.9% and -1.3% excluding currency and scope impacts, mainly due to workforce reduction in mature economies, in particular at Airgas. Purchases were down markedly by -11.7%, thanks to energy purchases, which benefited notably from a decrease in market prices, and purchases of other raw materials and equipments such as hardgoods. Other operating expenses and income were down -8.9% and included a steep reduction in subcontracting costs and travel expenses. Operating costs relating to the covid-19 pandemic and in particular idle-capacity costs, are included in operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization reached 2,138 million euros , stable compared with 2019, with scope effects, contract renewals, the end of the depreciation and amortization of certain assets, and currency effects offsetting the start-up of new units in 2020.\n\nThe Group's operating income recurring (OIR) amounted to 3,790 million euros in 2020, stable as published ( -0.1% ) but up +3.6% on a comparable basis versus 2019. The operating margin (OIR to revenue) stood at 18.5% , marking a strong improvement of +120 basis points compared with 2019 and of +80 basis points excluding the energy impact . Ongoing efficiency programs and the exceptional cost containment plan launched by the Group in response to the covid-19 crisis contributed significantly to performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EFFICIENCIES\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide is deploying at a global scale its bulk gases supply chain digitalization program , IBO (Integrated Bulk Operations). Digital technology enables the improvement of operational performance and in particular a reduction in the carbon footprint, in line with the Group's Climate Objectives. The deployment of IBO in its Industrial Merchant business line will further accelerate Air Liquide's digital transformation for an always better customer experience.\n\nimprovement despite a decline in business. The exceptional cost containment plan is estimated to contribute around +20 basis points out of the +80 basis points of margin improvement.\n\nEfficiencies (a) reached 441 million euros for 2020. They increased slightly by +1.8% compared with 2019, despite the decline in volumes due to the public health crisis, and largely exceeded the annual objective which had been set at more than 400 million euros. These efficiencies represent cost savings of 2.8%. Industrial efficiencies accounted for close to 50%, supported by investment in efficiency projects, notably the optimization of the supply chain in Industrial Merchant, and energy efficiencies in Large Industries. The implementation of digital tools aimed at the Group's transformation continued, with the acceleration of the roll-out of remote operation centers for Large Industries production units (Smart Innovative Operations, SIO), new optimization tools for delivery routes in Industrial Merchant (Integrated Bulk Operations, IBO), and the introduction of a remote patient monitoring platform in Healthcare.\n\nMoreover, exceptional cost reductions under the public health crisis response plan were due to the low level of activity and are not, due to their nature, sustainable in the long-term .\n\nPortfolio and pricing management also contributed to margin improvement.\n\n## Performance\n\n## Global Markets & Technologies\n\nGlobal Markets & Technologies revenue for 2020 reached 579 million euros , representing growth of +6.0% during a period marked by the public health crisis. The biogas activity was strong, with the start-up and ramp-up of production units in the United States and markedly higher biomethane sales for transport in Europe. Technology equipment sales were stable for 2020 as a whole, despite being affected by the public health crisis during the 2 nd quarter.\n\nOrder intake for Group projects and third-party customers totaled 598 million euros , representing a dynamic increase of +14.3%. They included in particular major contracts for helium cryogenic refrigerators, Turbo-Brayton LNG reliquefaction units and, in the 4 th quarter, hydrogen stations for China and South Korea.",

Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin stood at 19.4% , marking a significant increase of +120 basis points compared with 2019. The exceptional cost-cutting plan launched in response to the public health crisis was implemented rapidly and efficiently across the region, in particular at Airgas. This was in addition to the good performance of the efficiencies plan across all business lines (and more specifically in Industrial Merchant), strong price management with increases applied at the beginning of the year, as well as favorable mix effects. The combination of these effects were reflected in the marked increase in margins for the region, driven notably by the performance of Airgas.\n\nOperating income recurring for Europe reached 1,405 million euros , a slight decrease of -1.8% compared with 2019. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin was 19.9% , down just -10 basis points. The improvement in the Healthcare operating margin, due to volume effects, efficiencies generated and pricing impacts which were stable over the year, did not fully offset the impact of the slowdown on other businesses, and in particular on Large Industries which has the highest margin level. Moreover, the load rates of Large Industries production units, which were high in 2019, were impacted by irregular and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OPERATING PERFORMANCE - DIVESTITURES\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide closed in mid-August the divestiture of its subsidiary Sch\u00fclke & Mayr GmbH, a global leader in infection prevention and hygiene, to global investment firm EQT. This sale illustrates Air Liquide's strategy to review its business portfolio regularly and to focus on its core gases and healthcare businesses, thereby enhancing Air Liquide's performance.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide announced in early August the divestment of its subsidiary CryoPDP that has more than 250 employees in 12 countries to French private equity firm Hivest Capital Partners. CryoPDP provides global innovative temperature-controlled logistics solutions to the Clinical Research and Cell & Gene Therapy Communities.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide closed the divestiture of Czech Republic and Slovakia entities to Messer early-May.\n\nslower customer demand which generated additional costs. Industrial Merchant's operating margin proved resilient thanks to efficiency efforts, exceptional costs reduction plan, and price management.\n\nOperating income recurring for Asia Pacific totaled 985 million euros , an increase of +3.6% . The operating margin was 21.6% excluding the energy impact, up by a significant +180 basis points . Structural efficiency and exceptional cost containment measures made a major contribution to improving the margin. Moreover, in Electronics, the mix effect had a significant positive impact on the operating margin thanks to the excellent growth momentum of Carrier Gases and Advanced Materials sales, whereas Equipment & Installation sales were weaker. Finally, the Group's active business portfolio management, which included the disposal of the Fujian Shenyuan units in 2019 and the reduction or disposal of the Group's stakes in several distributors in Japan, also contributed to this improvement.\n\nOperating income recurring for the Middle East & Africa was 95 million euros , down -12.9% compared with 2019. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin totaled 16.7% , down -120 basis points as a result of the major decline in activity across the region due to the public health crisis, notably in Industrial Merchant in Africa, that cost reduction measures could not compensate for.",

They notably included costs relating to the realignment plans implemented in various countries and businesses and exceptional expenses of around 65 million euros associated with the management of the covid-19 public health crisis. They also included the capital gain on the disposal of the Sch\u00fclke subsidiary during the 2 nd half of the year. Moreover, some asset impairments were recorded on certain markets and geographies as part of the strategic review of the Group's asset portfolio, taking into account certain post-crisis strategic changes.\n\nThe financial result amounted to -440 million euros , due mainly to the cost of net debt which stood at -353 million euros (representing a decrease of -2.4% compared with 2019). This cost included the impact of the early redemption in December 2020 of bonds ('senior notes') issued by Airgas before its acquisition by Air Liquide. The average cost of net debt, excluding the early redemption of the Airgas senior notes, was 2.8% , lower than in 2019 due notably to the decrease in US dollar and emerging market-denominated debt which carries a higher cost. Other financial income and expenses amounted to -87 million euros compared with -106 million euros in 2019.\n\nIncome tax expense stood at 678 million euros , corresponding to an effective tax rate of 21.1% in 2020, a marked exceptional decline,\n\n## DIVIDEND\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2021, the payment of a dividend of 2.75 euros per share will be proposed to shareholders for the fiscal year 2020.

These notably included the disposal of the Sch\u00fclke and CryoPDP subsidiaries, as well as the disposal of businesses in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\n\nNet capital expenditure (a) amounted to 1,971 million euros.\n\nOver the past 3 years, 60% of the 14 billion euros cumulative cash flow were reinvested in the Group's activities, mainly through industrial investments but also acquisitions. Shareholder remuneration represented 30% of 2018-2020 cash flow use, and the remaining was allocated notably to manage working capital requirement or reduce net debt.\n\n## Performance\n\n## NET DEBT\n\nNet debt at December 31, 2020 reached 10,609 million euros . Despite the high level of investment, net debt was down significantly by 1,764 million euros compared with December 31, 2019 due to the increase in the Group's cash flow from operating activities, the decrease in working capital requirement, a favorable currency impact, and the disposal of Sch\u00fclke. The net debt-to-equity ratio stood at 55.8% , a marked decrease compared with the end of 2019 (64.0%) and a return to pre-Airgas acquisition levels.\n\n## ROCE\n\nThe return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 9.0% in 2020. Recurring ROCE (b) stood at 8.6% , stable compared with 2019 despite the decline in business due to the public health crisis.\n\n## 4.

This comes after the record high of 3.7 billion euros in 2019, which included the acquisition of Tech Air in the United States for more than 300 million euros. Decisions for 2020 did not include the acquisition of the 16 Air Separation Units from Sasol in South Africa, as the deal has not yet been officially closed.\n\nIndustrial investment decisions were higher than 3.0 billion euros for the second year in a row despite the challenging public health context. Electronics achieved a record level of investment, in particular thanks to the signing of new units for Advanced Materials in Singapore and for Carrier Gases in Taiwan, as well as decisions made during the 4 th quarter in Japan and China. Business development was also strong in Large Industries with the signature of the takeover of sites in Kazakhstan and Russia, as well as new Air Separation Units in Russia, Poland and, during the 4 th quarter, Germany. Investment decisions relating to the production of biogas for Global Markets & Technologies were also high, in particular in Italy and the United\n\nStates. More than 20% of industrial decisions contribute to the Climate objectives and 13% support margin improvement ( efficiencies ).\n\nFinancial investment decisions reached 148 million euros in 2020 for more than twenty bolt-on acquisitions, in particular in Home Healthcare in Europe, Industrial Merchant in North America and China, and in Engineering & Construction in the United States. This compares with a high level of 580 million euros in 2019 which included the acquisition of Tech Air in the United States.\n\nThe investment backlog reached 3.1 billion euros representing an increase of almost 300 million euros compared with the end of 2019. Large Industries projects for Chemicals customers represented the highest share of the backlog, the share of Electronics projects was at a record high, and the Oil and Gas market only represented around 10% of the total backlog. These investments should lead to a future contribution to annual sales of approximately 1.0 billion euros per year after the full ramp-up of the units, an increase compared to 0.9 billion euros at the end of 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Performance\n\n## Start-ups\n\nThere were 20 major start-ups during 2020. These notably included several Electronics units in Asia and new hydrogen production units for Large Industries , including one to supply the pipeline network of a major industrial basin in South Korea and another one to meet growing refining needs in Argentina. These also included biomethane production units in the United States and United Kingdom for Global Markets & Technologies and a nitrous oxide production unit for Industrial Merchant and Healthcare needs in the United States. In the 4 th quarter, the Group has also started up the world's largest PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzer (20 megawatts), producing renewable hydrogen in B\u00e9cancour, Canada.\n\nThe additional contribution to sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups totaled 191 million euros in 2020 despite the public health crisis, which was 11 million euros more than forecast in the 3 rd quarter.\n\nThe additional contribution to 2021 sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups should reach around 250 million euros , with an additional contribution from the 16 units that are currently being acquired in South Africa representing an estimated amount of around 100 million euros for 2021, as Air Liquide will not initially be responsible for managing the energy. Sales should exceed 400 million euros per year during the second phase, when energy management will be fully integrated, without any significant impact on operating income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INVESTMENT\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has now entered into a business purchase agreement with Sasol for Air Liquide to acquire the largest oxygen production site in the world located in Secunda, South Africa. In addition to the benefits this would bring in terms of safety, reliability and efficiency, the solution provided by Air Liquide would allow, in coordination with Sasol, a targeted reduction of 30% to 40% in CO 2 emissions arising from the oxygen production by 2030 . The amount of the initial investment would be approximately 8.5 billion South African Rand (circa 440 million euros ).\n\n## Investment opportunities\n\nThe 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities stood at 3.1 billion euros at the end of December, with several new entries during the 4 th quarter offsetting investment decisions and the removal from the portfolio of several projects that were either postponed beyond 12 months or awarded to the competition.\n\nThe type of opportunities has changed significantly and the energy transition represents 44% of the portfolio, notably with low-carbon hydrogen production projects through electrolysis, as well as the capture and storage of carbon dioxide ('CCS') in Large Industries . These projects may, however, be subject to accessing subsidies. The share of Electronics projects is also up significantly compared with 2019.\n\nEurope , where the majority of energy transition projects are based, has therefore become the leading region in the portfolio and has reached a record level with close to 40% of opportunities. This region is followed closely by Asia which represents more than one-third of the portfolio, driven by Electronics projects, followed by the Americas and the Middle East & Africa which have similar levels of opportunities.\n\n## 2020 FINANCING\n\n## 'A' category financial rating confirmed\n\nAir Liquide is rated by two main rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's. The long-term rating from Standard & Poor's is 'A-' and from Moody's is 'A3' . These are in line with the Group's strategy. Moreover, the short-term ratings are 'A2' for Standard & Poor's and 'P2' for Moody's. Standard & Poor's confirmed its ratings on July 24, 2020 and maintained its positive outlook. Moody's confirmed its ratings on July 7, 2020 and maintained its stable outlook.\n\n## Diversifying and securing financial sources\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Group financing through capital markets accounted for 93% of the Group's total debt , for a total amount of outstanding bonds of 11.3 billion euros including all types of bonds, and 0.2 billion euros of commercial paper.\n\nThe total amount of credit facilities was stable at 3.6 billion euros . The second one-year extension option was applied to this syndicated credit facility on November 6, 2020. The extension covers an unchanged amount of 2.5 billion euros and now matures in December 2025. Since 2019, this facility includes an indexation mechanism between its financial costs and three of the Group's CSR targets in the areas of carbon intensity, gender diversity, and safety.\n\nThe amount of total debt maturing in the next 12 months is 2.2 billion euros, an increase of 0.4 billion euros compared with December 31, 2019.\n\n## 2020 issues and redemptions\n\nIn March 2020, the Group issued a five-year private placement for an amount of 100 million euros .\n\nIn March 2020, under its EMTN program, the Group issued a public bond in two tranches of 500 million euros each , maturing in five and ten years .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCING\n\n- \u25a0 On March 26, 2020, Air Liquide successfully launched a \u20ac1 billion long term bond issuance. Proceeds from this issuance allowed the Group to refinance its June 2020 bond maturities in advance and will secure financing to support long term profitable growth. This issue will be rated 'A-' by Standard & Poor's and 'A3' by Moody's.\n\nIn June 2020, two bond issues for a total amount of 500 million euros each were redeemed.\n\nIn December 2020, the last two bond issues held by Airgas, for 250 and 300 million US dollars (for a total equivalent of 448 million euros), were redeemed early. As of December 31, 2020, Airgas no longer held any bond debt.\n\nAt the end of 2020, outstanding bonds issued under the EMTN program amounted to 6.9 billion euros (nominal amount).",

In 2020, net debt decreased in terms of volume for all of the main currencies. The share of the euro increased whereas that of the US dollar declined, following the redemption of the bond debt held by Airgas, and due to the currency impact (appreciation of the euro against the US dollar).\n\n## Centralization of cash and funding\n\nAir Liquide Finance pools the cash balances of Group entities.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Air Liquide Finance had granted to Group subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, the equivalent of 13.3 billion euros in loans and received 3.3 billion euros in excess cash as deposits from them. These transactions were denominated in 29 currencies (primarily the euro, US dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi and Singapore dollar). Approximately 400 subsidiaries are included in the Group cash pooling, directly or indirectly (including subsidiaries where cash pooling is carried out locally before being centralized at Air Liquide Finance).\n\n## Debt maturity and schedule\n\nThe average of the Group's debt maturity was 5.8 years at December 31, 2020, a decrease compared to December 31, 2019. Thanks to the generation of net cash flow in 2020, bond issues reached maturity or were redeemed early in 2020 without the need for refinancing.\n\n## Appendices\n\n## PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nPerformance indicators used by the Group that are not directly defined in the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the AMF position 2015-12 about alternative performance measures.\n\nThe performance indicators are the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Group revenues Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 2016-2019;\n- \u25a0 Currency, energy and significant scope impacts;\n- \u25a0 Comparable sales change and comparable operating income recurring change;\n\nThe following chart shows the Group's debt maturity schedule.

The currency effect is calculated based on the aggregates for the period converted at the exchange rate for the previous period.\n\nIn addition, the Group passes on variations in the cost of energy (electricity and natural gas) to its customers via indexed invoicing integrated into their medium and long-term contracts. This indexing can lead to significant variations in sales (mainly in the Large Industries Business Line) from one period to another depending on fluctuations in prices on the energy market.\n\nAn energy impact is calculated based on the sales of each of the main subsidiaries in Large Industries. Their consolidation allows the determination of the energy impact for the Group as a whole. The foreign exchange rate used is the average annual exchange rate for the year N-1. Thus, at the subsidiary level, the following formula provides the energy impact, calculated for natural gas and electricity respectively:\n\nThis indexation effect of electricity and natural gas does not impact the operating income recurring.\n\nThe significant scope effect corresponds to the impact on sales of all acquisitions or disposals of a significant size for the Group. These changes in scope of consolidation are determined:\n\n- \u25a0 for acquisitions during the period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for acquisitions during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition between January 1 of the current period and the anniversary date of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for disposals during the period, by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity as of the anniversary date of the disposal;\n- \u25a0 for disposals during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity.\n\nEnergy impact = Share of sales indexed to energy year (N-1) x (Average energy price in year (N) - Average energy price in year (N-1))\n\n## Group revenues Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 2016-2019\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                      | 2016   | 2019   | CAGR   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| (A) Group revenues                                          | 18,135 | 21,920 | +6.5%  |\n| (B) Currency impact (2016)                                  |        | (787)  |        |\n| (A) - (B) = Group revenues excluding currency impact (2016) | 18,135 | 22,707 | +7.8%  |\n\n## CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (YEAR)\n\n## Comparable sales change and comparable operating income recurring change\n\nComparable changes for sales and operating income recurring exclude the currency, energy and significant scope impacts described above.

Air Liquide has also declared its support for the TCFD.\n\n## 5.2.

The SASB takes five elements into account when establishing its standards: environment;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsocial capital; human capital; innovation and economic model; and leadership and governance.\n\nCross-reference tables are available in Chapter 5 pages 320 and 321 of the present Universal Registration Document which show the relationships between the recommendations and the Air Liquide various initiatives and actions.\n\nAt group level, the objectives are to increase diversity within the managerial population to strengthen the balance between men and women and representation of younger generations. To this end, quantified objectives have been set under the neos company program.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\n| 2025 Goals                                         | 2020 Results                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| of women among Group managers   and professionals. | of women among Group managers   and professionals. |\n\n## PROPORTION OF WOMEN AMONG MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(a) Including Airgas since 2017. (b) Including Airgas since 2016.\n\nThe Group has set a number of ambitious gender goals, which aim to reach:\n\n- \u25a0 35% women at 'Managers and professionals' level, by 2025. These objectives are in line with the results obtained over the last ten years, which have seen an increase from 26% to 30% in the proportion of women at 'Managers and professionals' level within the Group;\n- \u25a0 25% women at the highest level of responsibility (executive positions) by 2025.\n\nThe ambitious objectives set for gender equality at 'Managers and Professionals' and 'Senior Executive' level, along with maintenance of the gender equality target among the Group's 'high flyers' also aims, by developing female talents towards upper management levels, to build a pool of talents which will ensure a balanced representation of men and women within the Executive Committee.\n\nIn 2020, women represented 43% of employees considered as high flyers, this level has been increasing regularly for a number of years and must be maintained. The Executive Committee includes five women among its fourteen members. Three of these were appointed in 2019, having previously held executive positions within the Group. Six women are currently members of the Board of Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A., out of a total of eleven members appointed by the General Meeting.\n\nIn a more general sense, and taking into consideration those with the highest levels of responsibility across the whole Group, women occupy 20% of the 'Top 100' positions, and 21% of all positions described as 'Executive' beyond the targets set by the Board of Directors for 2020. This percentage has increased from 19% to 21% in the last three years.\n\nThe 10% of positions with the highest responsibility within the Company have a proportion of 27% women, these women having an average age of 51.8 years and a median age of 52.4 years, i.e. respectively 2.4 and 2.8 years less than the average age (54.2 years) and median age (55.2 years) of men. This difference shows the results of the policy intended to promote women to top levels of responsibility and to do so earlier in their careers, and thus eliminate career-development differences which may appear without deliberate and specific action.",

These innovations, which are co-developed with the ecosystems, meet the customers' and patients' needs and usages and contribute to major societal challenges. Likewise, by applying the OECD's definition, 4,300 employees work within entities dedicated to innovation or which contribute to innovation by developing and launching new offers and products.\n\nPatented inventions contribute to the Group's competitiveness and differentiation of its offers, and illustrate its capacity for technological innovations. 347 new inventions were protected in 2020.

In 2020, new developments were launched in Italy, in the UK, in Norway and in the United States, where the existing production units also ramped up. Air Liquide has 20 biomethane production units around the world with an annual production capacity of 1.3 TWh.\n\n- ) 250,000/uni00A0tons of CO2 avoided over the last 3 years\n\n## Hydrogen and CO2 at the core of an integrated industrial scheme\n\nThe new-generation SMR-X hydrogen production unit commissioned in 2020 on the Covestro site, a long-standing customer and world leader in the production of high-tech polymeric materials at Antwerp in Belgium, produces hydrogen without excess steam. These proprietary technologies increase energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint. Impact: the overall consumption of natural gas to produce hydrogen and CO2 emissions are reduced by about 5% compared to a traditional SMR. Moreover, some of the CO2 generated during the production process is captured by Covestro and used as a raw material in its own production process.\n\n- ) -5% CO2 emissions compared to a traditional SMR\n\n## Renewable hydrogen thanks to the largest electrolyzer in the world\n\nIn 2020, the Group built and started up at B\u00e9cancour in Canada, the largest PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzer in the world , with a capacity of 20 megawatts, allowing it to produce 8.2 tons a day of low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial scale, for the industrial and mobility markets of North America. This will allow to fuel 2,000 hydrogen cars per day. This electrolyzer, the first to be incorporated on an Air Liquide industrial production site, uses technology from the Canadian company Hydrogenics, expert in hydrogen production, by water electrolysis and fuel cells. Air Liquide took a minority share in the company's capital in 2019, alongside the Cummins Group, the major shareholder. The Group already uses Hydrogenics' equipment in the HyBalance project in Denmark.\n\n- ) 27,000/uni00A0tons of CO2 per year avoided, equivalent to the annual emissions from 10,000 cars\n- ) Zero noise and zero particle emissions\n- (a)  Technologies to reduce the CO2 emissions of the Group and its clients: improvements in the energy efficiency of production units, use of oxygen and hydrogen to reduce carbon footprint, carbon capture and storage of CO2, biomethane and hydrogen energy.\n- (b)  Cumulative capital expenditures for the 2014-2020 period in biomethane and in hydrogen mobility, beyond Innovation expenses.",

Transferred to all blast furnaces on this thyssenkrupp's site, this innovative process will enable to reduce CO2 from the production processes by 20%.\n\n- ) Ambition: -20% CO2 emissions from the production process\n\n## Producing oxygen by adapting to the intermittency of renewable energy sources\n\nThe future large-scale air separation unit (2,000 tons of oxygen per day) of the Group, in the port of Moerdijk in the Netherlands, will include an energy storage system which helps to stabilize the electric grid and allow to increase the quantity of renewable energy used. In 2022, this highly-powerful ASU will incorporate the proprietary Alive\u2122 solution, an innovation which will allow to store/unstore 25 MWh in the first instance, and then 40 MWh (which corresponds to the daily consumption by 4,000 households). While ensuring continuity of production for customers, this flexible system will adapt to the intermittency of renewable energies , thus allowing an increase in the quantity of wind and solar power on the grid.\n\n## ) Ambition: reduction in electricity consumption of 10% through renewables\n\n## Simultaneously producing high-purity low-carbon oxygen and hydrogen\n\nThe investment of nearly 200 million euros in the scientific parks of Tainan and Hsinchu in Taiwan to support a leader of the semiconductor market on the long term, will include a number of breakthrough innovations. To produce ultra-pure hydrogen and oxygen from 2021, Air Liquide will integrate large-size ALCALIN electrolyzers (among the biggest in the world) to convert water into ultra-pure hydrogen at a rate of 5,000 Nm 3 /hour. The production site will also be the first of its kind to recover hydrogen and oxygen from water electrolysis. The hydrogen will be guaranteed to be low-carbon, the electrolyzers being partly powered by renewable energies. Ultra-pure nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen are essential to support the development of some of the world's most advanced logical integrated circuits intended to improve speed and reliability of digital connections of IT infrastructures and 5G.\n\n## ) Ambition: avoid 20,000/uni00A0tons of CO2 emissions per year\n\n## Capturing CO2 from industrial ports and storing it under the North Sea\n\nAir Liquide is a stakeholder in CO 2 capture and storage projects for the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam. The joint projects carried out with Equinor, Shell and Total as part of the Northern Lights project is based on the development of offshore storage of CO2 on the Norwegian continental plate which could become the first storage site in the world to receive CO2 from the industrial sources of a number of European countries. Supported by European subsidies, the Antwerp@C project, made up of seven leading companies (Air Liquide, BASF, Borealis, ExxonMobil, INEOS, Fluxys, Port of Antwerp and Total) aims to carry out of technical and economic studies on the cross-border transportation infrastructures for CO 2 to reduce emissions from the port of Antwerp by half: create a liquid CO2 export terminal and a CO2 pipeline in the port of Antwerp to the Netherlands. Air Liquide is working in particular on liquefaction with the production of a CO2 liquefier, producing 4,000 tons per day, in order to consider transportation of CO2, either by boat in liquid form to a natural reservoir at sea, or by pipeline in gas form.\n\n- ) Ambition: reduce CO2 emissions by half from the port of Antwerp to 2030 (i.e. more than 9 million tons of GHG avoided)",

Developed in partnership with the Vaccine Formulation Institute (VFI), a non-profit organization from the WHO, Sepivac SWE\u2122 is presented in the form of an oil-in-water micro-emulsion, a proven technology that increases the efficiency of the vaccine, by stimulating and directing the immune response. This new adjuvant is being marketed to laboratories on an open access basis, without a license agreement, to make it widely available for use in the fight against covid-19. Seppic has been producing it since April 2020 for preclinical research programs and since July for human clinical trials. In particular, it is integrated in the VIDO (Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization)-COVAC-2 clinical study in Canada for the covid-19 Bio-pharma vaccine, which phase I was launched early 2021.\n\n## ) Ambition: manufacture innovative vaccines to fight influenza\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Data at the heart of remote centers\n\nWith seven remote operational centers around the world, Air Liquide is continuing the deployment of its global Smart & Innovative Operations (SIO) program which relies on data analysis to improve the reliability of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen plants and optimize energy consumption. This program ensures the optimal operation of the production facilities by monitoring in real time that the plants are running at optimal levels in terms of energy efficiency. It is also used to maximize their reliability rate, which is another key element of energy consumption. The predictive maintenance tool, applied to 212 production sites, has allowed roll out 7,500 models, to identify around 600 preventive actions and thus avoid an impact on customers' industrial production. SIO is a strong contributor to the Group's efficiencies program.\n\n## ) 585 early detections of maintenance needs\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide launched its Integrated Bulk Operations (IBO) program to optimize the liquid supply chain from end-to-end. The digital connection of assets in the supply chain, going from the production sites to the tanks located on customer sites and including trucks, allowed data to be collected for analysis. Digital contributes to improve the customer experience as well as the operational performance and the carbon footprint of the supply chain.\n\n## ) Ambition: -10%/uni00A0km traveled by 2025\n\n## Automation of order preparation\n\nThe gradual automation of the filling center chain including automated facilities on the order preparation lines, for sorting and filling empty cylinders, as at Feyzin and Nantes in France, allows tasks to be rationalized and optimized. For employees, it reduces the laborious work of handling the heavy steel cylinders. For each order, the robot had to learn around 7000 possible combinations of cylinders and can prepare an order in two minutes, on average.

First used in the United States and Brazil, they were then used by Operations to predict the oxygen demand of hospitals and to better manage the filling centers in Europe (France, Italy, Spain), but also in support of the Home Healthcare activities to anticipate the availability of concentrators and the demands of patients returning from hospital. The proposed solution in particular allowed to anticipate medical oxygen deliveries when the demand was two times higher than normal in April 2020, and even two-and-a-half times higher than normal in November 2020.\n\n## ) Ambition: Integrate AI to strengthen the reliability of our offers and anticipate critical situations\n\n## TECH & DEEP TECH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electronic chips with lower environmental impact\n\nThe production of chips requires over 800 steps, with around 300 different gases and materials. enScribe\u2122 is a family of advanced etch materials developed by Air Liquide which enables the fabrication of complex chips while reducing the environmental impact. Developed for the production of a new generation of 3D memories, these innovative materials are capable of etching the deep structure of the chips. In addition, due to their chemical structure, they have a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere, which reduces the environmental impact of etching. One enScribe\u2122 material has been successfully implemented on the market, and additional materials are currently in development, with several in testing phase at partner sites. The usage of these advanced materials led to a decrease of CO2 emissions of 140,000 tons in 2020 and are forecasted to reach 240,000 tons by 2025.\n\n## ) 140,000/uni00A0tons of CO2 emissions avoided in 2020\n\n## A cryogenic technological solution which reduces GHG at sea\n\nUsing maritime transport, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) tends to evaporate and discharge CO2. The technological solution for refrigeration and liquefaction developed by the Group allows to reliquefy the evaporation of natural gas and to considerably reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, allowing the maritime industry to carry out transportation more efficiently and with a lower impact on the environment. This solution is a commercial success: over the last three years, around sixty Turbo-Brayton cryogenics equipment have been sold by Air Liquide.\n\n## ) 290,000/uni00A0tons of CO2-equivalent emissions avoided per year\n\n## Ultra pure gases produced on the electronics manufacturers' sites\n\nThe electronic manufacturers require total supply reliability of ultra pure gases (nitrogen in particular). Air Liquide has developed large on-site production units (TCN) for various gases which have maximum levels of safety, reliability and flexibility for a competitive running cost. They produce different gases directly at the customer's premises and guarantee a degree of purity of 99.99999% (less than one impurity per billion). In the last two years, 9 TCNs have come into operation in Asia, particularly in China. They produce carrier gases, compressed air and nitrogen for the leaders in the electronics industry.\n\n## ) 9 new on-site production units in operation\n\n## Pushing the boundaries of science and technology\n\nWith the acquisition of 80% of the capital of Cryoconcept, specialist in refrigeration by dilution based on the use of helium 3 (the liquid with the lowest boiling point in existence) and helium 4, Air Liquide has technologies to reach temperatures of less than 10 milliKelvin, near absolute zero, i.e. -273.14\u00b0C. The Group is thus developing its offer for fundamental physics research in fields such as the detection of dark matter, microscopes to explore the infinitely small, as well as current research projects on quantum computing.

Some of these risks, which meet the requirements of Prospectus Regulation III, are included in the 'Risk factors and management measures' section of this chapter.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\nThe Group identifies the risk factors to which it is exposed using a formal risk management approach. This presentation of risk factors and related management measures is based on the reference framework of the internal control and risk management system, developed under the supervision of the French financial markets authority (AMF). It was prepared with contributions from several departments (particularly Finance, Group Control and Compliance, Legal, Safety and Industrial Systems, etc.).\n\nThe risks presented below, at the date of this Universal Registration Document, are the risks that the Group considers may have a significant negative impact on its business, results, outlook, or reputation, should they occur. The list of these risks is, however, not exhaustive and other risks, unknown at the date of this document, could occur and have a negative effect on the Group's business.\n\nAs part of its risk management approach, the Group is committed to regularly assessing the risks and to reducing the likelihood that they will occur or their potential impact by implementing internal control and risk management procedures, as well as formalized and specific action plans. These procedures, as well as the Group's codes and policies, are included in a global reference manual, called the BlueBook, which is the cornerstone of the Group's internal control system.\n\nRisk factors are presented below as net risks (taking into account management measures already implemented) and divided into a limited number of categories according to their nature. In each category, the most significant risk factors are presented first (in bold).\n\nAlthough the risk categories have not been classed in order of size, the two most significant specific risks for the Air Liquide Group are both related to its business. These are industrial risks and industrial investment-related risks.\n\n## IMPACTS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nThe current public health crisis related to the global spread of covid-19, which is not specific to the Group, increases some of these risk factors. As a result, the Group has applied adapted management measures in each country and each business.\n\nAs of the beginning of 2020, the Group moved quickly to implement crisis management that was both global (travel restrictions, ban on gatherings, digital protection, remote working related rules, etc.) and local (contact with authorities to ensure that the Group's business was classed as essential to enable its operating continuity) while also encouraging the transfer of expertise between regions according to the way in which the pandemic developed.\n\nAs part of the Group's crisis management system, the operational business continuity plans were therefore activated, and remote working for teams implemented.\n\nNevertheless, the Group believes that the uncertainty surrounding the duration, scale and future development of the pandemic (including the additional waves of infection and potential mutations in the virus) coupled with the pace at which vaccines are administered across the world, make it difficult to predict the global impact on the economies of the Group's main markets and, as a result, on its financial situation.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and management measures\n\nThe impact of the crisis has affected the following risk factors and has led to the reinforcement of current management measures and, in certain cases, to specific management measures:\n\n- \u25a0 Human resources management risks: an immediate effect of lockdown measures introduced in various countries in which the Group is present was the large-scale introduction of homeworking, the reorganization of production facilities and the increased use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. This adjustment, and the associated risk management, were facilitated by the existence of a digital and collaborative environment that had already been rolled out within the Group several years ago, as well as the stepping up of virtual training courses covering remote working and team management. In the workplace, employees and external service providers received specific protocols aimed at the application of health measures required by the governments in order to prevent the risk of contagion. External telephone support helplines have also been introduced to help protect the mental health of employees.\n- \u25a0 Industrial risks: due to modification of the Company's organization as a result of public health measures and fewer employees physically present at production facilities at times, the Group adapted its processes to maintain the safety of employees and facilities, in addition to specific awareness-raising actions.\n- \u25a0 Digital risks: the covid-19 pandemic is a prime time for cyberattacks due to the climate of general uncertainty and worry and the increased use of digital solutions, in particular for homeworking. Against this backdrop, the Group stepped up its awareness-raising action vis-\u00e0-vis its teams regarding issues such as fraud and the theft of personal and confidential data. It was also necessary to adjust its user capacities and safety parameters to accommodate for greater levels of homeworking, while maintaining the efficiency of its major incident detection and processing system.\n- \u25a0 Customer risks and industrial investment-related risks: the pandemic, and its impact on the global economy, has increased the risk of the temporary or permanent interruption to the business of certain customers which could lead to payment defaults and/\n\nor late payments in the short term and to a permanent decline in revenue in the longer term. The same applies to industrial investment projects, the execution of which could be delayed for reasons related to the customer or the supply chain. The diversity of the Group's sites, as well as the industries and sectors in which it works, notably those where demand has increased significantly (healthcare, pharmaceuticals) or which have demonstrated their resilience (food and electronics), help reduce, but not neutralize, its exposure to this risk.\n\n- \u25a0 Supply-related risks: the temporary shutdown of certain industries and the closure of some borders during lockdowns may have created tension in the supply of particular products or molecules, with the need to implement alternative supply arrangements to continue to meet customers' needs.\n- \u25a0 Counterparty and liquidity risks: various prudential measures were taken to strengthen the Group's short- and medium-term liquidity and thus contribute to its resilience, with in particular a 1 billion-euro bond issue in March 2020 and the introduction of an additional cost reduction and control plan.\n- \u25a0 Regulatory and legal risks: in response to the pandemic, some states have modified, using special purpose mechanisms (laws or ordinances), several regulatory and legal provisions governing the manner in which professional activities should be conducted. The Group monitored these changes and, where necessary, integrated them to its processes. Moreover, the pandemic, with the urgent demand for medical supplies, the simplification of rules governing procurement, and the closure of certain borders, may have exposed the Group in certain regions to an increased risk of corruption. Since the beginning of the crisis, the Group has strengthened awareness raising of its anti-corruption framework.\n\nAlthough this crisis increases the probability and/or the impact of the above-mentioned risk factors, it is not of a nature to call into question the scope and classification of these Group-specific risks as presented in this Universal Registration Document.\n\n| Risk categories                          | Risk factors Industrial risks Industrial investment-related risks   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | Sourcing-related risks                                              |\n| Business-related risks                   | Risks relating to the design and construction of production units   |\n|                                          | Innovation-related risks                                            |\n|                                          | Human Resources management related risks                            |\n|                                          | Customer risks                                                      |\n|                                          | Counterparty and liquidity risks                                    |\n|                                          | Foreign exchange risks                                              |\n| Financial risks                          | Interest rate risks                                                 |\n|                                          | Risks involving credit ratings                                      |\n|                                          | Tax risks                                                           |\n| Digital risks                            | Digital risks                                                       |\n|                                          | Climate risks (greenhouse gas emissions)                            |\n| Environmental and societal risks         | Climate risks (physical impact on Operations)                       |\n|                                          | Discrimination-related risks                                        |\n| Geopolitical, regulatory and legal risks | Geopolitical risks                                                  |\n| Geopolitical, regulatory and legal risks | Regulatory and legal risks                                          |",

Business-related risks\n\nThe industrial gas business is characterized by a significant technology content (both in the design phase and the construction of production units), local production units, high capital intensity, and substantial energy requirements.\n\nVarious risks are associated with these characteristics. They are mitigated by various factors which include primarily the diversity of industries and customers served by the Group, the multiple gas applications that it offers them, as well as the large number of geographical locations in which it operates. In addition, a significant share of business is subject to contracts, a strict investment project authorization and management process, and a tailored energy policy.\n\n## 1.1. INDUSTRIAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nIndustrial risks are linked to the various industrial products, processes and distribution methods implemented by the Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\nOver and above the usual risks inherent in all industrial activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks relating to:\n\n- \u25a0 products: the intrinsic properties of industrial gases manufactured, transformed or packaged by the Group classifies them in the dangerous materials category;\n- \u25a0 processes and their operation: cryogenics is used to separate gases by distillation, store them and transport them. This very low temperature technique requires specific means of control and protection to avoid in particular:\n- - cryogenic burns associated with liquefied gases,\n- - anoxia, associated with inert gases,\n- - over-oxygenation or fires, associated with oxygen and oxygen mixtures.\n\nThe same applies for high temperature techniques, used in particular in the production of hydrogen, which are particularly exposed to risks of fire or explosions.\n\nIn addition, pressure is central to the Group's processes. Pressurized equipment must be designed with safety devices which limit the risk of accidents caused by an uncontrolled increase of pressure;\n\n- \u25a0 logistics and transportation: each year, delivery vehicles, sales staff and technicians travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Non-compliance with the Highway Code or the lack of regular maintenance of vehicles would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents. In addition, industrial sites use a lot of motorized lifting gear which present specific risks (collision, falling packaging, etc.). Training and authorization are thus required to operate them;\n- \u25a0 engineering and construction: industrial risks are factored in and must commence at the design phase of future installations. During the construction phase, the lack of a strict accident prevention framework would affect the coordination among the various stakeholders and expose teams to risks of accidents;\n- \u25a0 delivery reliability: the Group is exposed to the risk of faults in the systems supplying gas to customers, which could lead to a disruption to supply, in terms of quality or volumes;\n- \u25a0 specific standards and regulations, in particular in Healthcare, with the risk of non-compliance of products and services provided to patients.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and management measures\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nSafety is a fundamental value for the Group and the 'zero accidents, on every site, in every region, in every unit' ambition remains a key priority.\n\nThe Group is therefore committed to efficiently and under all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, subcontractors, suppliers, customers and patients to professional and industrial risks.\n\nThe safety results for the past 30 plus years illustrate the long-term effectiveness of the Group's actions in this area.\n\nTo manage these risks, the Group has an Industrial Management System (IMS), which operates based on:\n\n- \u25a0 empowerment of the Management bodies governing the Group's various entities for the effective implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 the issue of key management and organizational procedures that aim to ensure:\n- - compliance with standards and regulations,\n- - design management,\n- - industrial risk management,\n- - hygiene, health and environmental management,\n- - the training and certification of personnel,\n- - the management of operating and maintenance procedures,\n- - the management of industrial purchasing,\n- - change management,\n- - the analysis and treatment of incidents and accidents,\n- - the dissemination of shared technical standards within Group entities.\n\nThe IMS document base is updated and supplemented on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Safety and Industrial Systems Department and the Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines supervise and control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 on-going awareness-raising actions for teams by providing specifically related training;\n- \u25a0 the presentation of various dashboards designed to monitor performance in terms of the safety and reliability of operations;\n- \u25a0 process audits to verify the implementation conditions and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 thorough safety reviews prior to the start-up of any new facility to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical audits carried out by the Industrial Departments to ensure the compliance of operations with Group rules.\n\nThe evolution of safety performances of operations and their level of compliance with IMS requirements are regularly monitored by the Executive Committee.\n\n## 1.2.   INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group may be exposed to certain risks specific to its industrial investments. Each investment project may be affected, particularly in its profitability, by different factors linked primarily to project location, customer quality, good project management by the customer, and particularly the respect of implementation schedules, the competitiveness of the site, the environmental footprint or societal impact of the project, as well as to design, cost estimates, quality, and meeting construction deadlines and budgets for gas production units, including for suppliers.\n\nMoreover, in new emerging markets such as those related to energy transition, the Group may be exposed, in addition to the abovementioned risks, to risks related to the degree of maturity of some of these market segments or in certain regions.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe BlueBook's Operations control policy sets out the principles of the strict control of the Group's industrial investments and its commitments, the implementation of which is set out in the investment decisions procedure. The latter includes in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 a detailed review and approval process of investment requests based on very strict assessment criteria as well as of any associated medium- and long-term contractual commitments, within the Resources and Investment Committees (described on page 41);\n- \u25a0 control of investment decisions through the specific follow-up of authorizations granted as well as contributions expected and seen during the initial years. In addition, the subsidiaries are obliged to report (above certain thresholds) all budget overruns and implement corrective action plans aimed at ensuring the profitability of the investments concerned; for the largest ones, they are supported by teams of experts ('Group Capital Implementation' teams) in order to secure good preparation and execution;\n- \u25a0 more in-depth analysis of the profitability of certain major investments (comparative analysis prior and subsequent to completion).",

SOURCING-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nElectricity and natural gas are the main raw materials used by production units. Their availability is thus essential to the Group. Where the local market permits, Group subsidiaries secure the energy sourcing through medium to long-term supply commitments and competitive bidding scenarios with local suppliers with the objective of achieving the most reliable and competitive energy costs, with a low-carbon footprint, available on the market.\n\nRisks to which the Group are exposed when sourcing raw materials relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 energy supply (access and reliability, in particular counterparty risk, etc.);\n- \u25a0 volumes (non-compliance with obligations and commitments on volumes, etc.);\n- \u25a0 prices (volatility, competitiveness, etc.);\n- \u25a0 compliance with current regulations (market transparency rules, Sapin 2 Law, etc.);\n- \u25a0 changes in local regulations on energy and its deregulation;\n- \u25a0 their carbon footprint.\n\nFinancial risk relating to raw materials is described in note 25.1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 262.\n\nMoreover, and in addition to energy, the Group may be temporarily exposed to supply shortages for certain molecules which are only produced at a limited number of sites, in particular with worldwide reach, such as helium and rare gases.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nDue to the geographic spread of Group activities, its supply contracts are diversified.\n\nThe management of exposure to specific energy sourcing risks is described in the Group's Energy management policy and is based on two principles:\n\n- \u25a0 energy purchasing must exclusively cover internal production needs ('own-use');\n- \u25a0 entities pass on energy cost fluctuations to their customers via indexed invoicing integrated into their medium- and long-term gas supply contracts.\n\nThe Energy Risk Management Group Committee, 'Enrisk', reviews the procurement strategies of the entities, examines the most significant commitments and ensures the relevant procedures are properly applied, in particular in terms of sustainable development.\n\nEach month, this Enrisk Committee brings together the Vice President in charge of the Large Industries World Business Line, the Energy Director, the Group Finance and Treasury Director and the Director in charge of Accounting policies and procedures. Meeting minutes are sent to all Executive Committee members.\n\nMoreover, risks relating to the sourcing of certain molecules produced at a limited number of sites with worldwide reach are managed by a strategy of diversifying sources, storing molecules and securing procurement through long-term contracts.\n\n## 1.4.   RISKS RELATING TO THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PRODUCTION UNITS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide's engineering team designs and builds production units worldwide which are primarily intended for Group investments, but also for third-party customers.\n\nAs these projects generally extend over several years, they are exposed, at their various stages, to risks relating to design, purchasing, transport or construction and more generally the overall quality, schedule and costs. Risks relating to these projects are often greater during the construction phase, in particular for turnkey projects:\n\n- \u25a0 the quality and delivery times for critical equipment, on the one hand, and on-site construction costs and deadlines on the other may give rise to project start-up setbacks and impact project profitability;\n- \u25a0 unexpected technical problems may also arise, in particular when a new innovative process is implemented;\n- \u25a0 certain projects are located in regions of the world that may be a source of specific political or economic risks.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe engineering team has implemented a risk management system for the execution of all its projects (of varying size and complexity and which use different types of technology), which is described in the Engineering-specific document the 'Playbook'.\n\nThis system relies on an Engineering Risk Committee and aims to guarantee effective risk assessment for the duration of each project's life and the implementation of adequate risk management measures:\n\n- \u25a0 during the development stage: by identifying, as best as possible, potential threats (but also opportunities) that may have an impact on the project's results during the forthcoming execution stage, thus allowing adequate decisions to be taken;\n- \u25a0 during the execution stage: by continuing to regularly assess already-identified risks which could change, occur or disappear, but also by identifying and dealing with any new threats which could have an impact on the contractual commitments, technical integrity or performance of the project right through until its completion.",

INNOVATION-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group operates in an environment where change is picking up pace, with the arrival of new products, new players, new business models and new technologies. The Group may not correctly predict the impact of technological changes on its main markets, relating for example to connected objects, hydrogen energy or artificial intelligence. Its growth capacity may thus be reduced.\n\nIn terms of digital technologies, the Group may not drive its transformation at an adequate pace and to a sufficient level to meet the challenges faced, with a possible impact on its business model, its organization and, ultimately, its competitiveness. The risk to which the Group is exposed is notably related to the rapid increase in the nature, volume and availability of data, regardless of whether or not this is a result of connected customers and patients, big data, the blockchain or artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Group's innovation policy requires significant investments, in particular in research and development for which the expected benefits cannot be guaranteed.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group has introduced a dedicated structure to roll out its innovation strategy which focuses on two objectives: contributing to its operational excellence and creating new offers in both its traditional and new business lines. The Innovation & Development Division (IDD) therefore steers the innovation strategy on behalf of the Group's hubs and operations, and contributes to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nDrawing on continuous reflection regarding the markets of the future, the IDD is responsible for imagining, developing and incubating new solutions through to their launch on the market, in particular when related to offers with major technological content (including digital and IT). To do so, it relies on its i-Lab (innovation lab or innovation laboratory) which acts as a catalyst to detect and study emerging and systemic trends.\n\nThe Group continuously adapts its innovation approach and invests each year in research and development and digital services. In recent years, it has reinforced its open innovation approach, focused on the energy transition and the environment - a significant portion of the innovation spend is indeed allocated to the elaboration of new processes which consume less energy and limit CO2 emissions -, healthcare, digital solutions and deeptech. Five Innovation campuses, located across the globe, aim to create a connected network which is open to its innovation partners - universities and technology institutes, suppliers, customers and start-ups.\n\nThe Group is introducing digital solutions into its operations, to improve efficiency and help steer business and investments with greater speed and agility. The roll out of Smart & Innovative Operations centers which facilitate the remote management of production at its sites, by drawing on predictive analysis and digital technologies, is an example of the contribution to the Group's technological and digital transformation. Moreover, the roll out of Integrated Bulk Operations program, aimed at digitizing the liquid gas supply chain, provides Industrial Merchant customers with access to a service which guarantees greater reliability and safety.",

HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe long-term performance of the Air Liquide Group is driven, in particular, by the quality of its employees, their skills and their commitment. In its businesses, the Group is therefore exposed to the risk of not being able to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the right place, in particular in emerging countries where the Group is expanding its activities, or in regions where the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 develop these skills, in particular with the digitization of certain businesses.\n\nThese risks would result, in particular, in shortcomings in:\n\n- \u25a0 the level or quality of training,\n- \u25a0 the management of careers and opportunities, and\n- \u25a0 the recognition of performances and contributions, in particular in certain areas of expertise.\n\nIn addition to risks relating to skills management, psycho-social risks may also affect the health and level of commitment of Group employees, in particular in the recent context where homeworking has been rapidly implemented during periods of lockdown.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group is committed to identifying, attracting and developing the necessary scientific, technical and digital skills required for its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. The Human Resources policy defines the main rules, together with the roles and responsibilities of the different parties in their implementation, with respect to, among others:\n\n- \u25a0 the acquisition and sustaining of required skills, in particular through the SPRING long-term program, which identifies and manages critical skills. Training provided under the Air Liquide University brand also contributes to this goal and, in particular, the reinforcement of e-learning courses attended by an increasing number of users (more than 62,000 in 2020) in a wide range of domains (ethics, industrial safety, competition law, digital security, management, etc.). This training is part of a program and is managed by a dedicated learning management tool (LMS: Learning Management System).\n- \u25a0 supporting employees in their personal development throughout their career, particularly thanks to a centralized career and skills management tool (TMS: Talent Management System) and the communication of career advancement opportunities (TAS: Talent Acquisition System);\n- \u25a0 measuring and recognizing performance and contributions for all employees. In addition to employee remuneration and loyalty policies (regular capital increases reserved for employees), specific provisions aimed at promoting and sustaining certain skills, such as inventor and entrepreneur recognition programs, the technical expertise development scheme ('Technical Community Leaders') in a wide range of fields such as industrial operations, industrial safety and, more recently, digital and IT since 2019.\n\nMore generally, the Group ensures the building of a performance-focused, attractive and collaborative professional environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of Group employees in their workplace. The measurement and monitoring of the commitment of employees is carried out using an employee listening tool called 'MyVoice'. Operations and support functions use the results from My Voice to define and implement tailored action plans.\n\nThe growth in homeworking has increased the use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. Employees' adjustment to this new way of working was facilitated by the existence of a digital and collaborative environment that had already been rolled out within the Group several years ago, as well as the development of virtual training courses covering remote working and team management.",

CUSTOMER RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe primary customer risk is the risk of bankruptcy or closure of a customer's production site.\n\nMore generally, the business of some of the Group's customers may be interrupted following natural or man-made disasters, including those resulting from changes in weather conditions, pandemics, climate change, or following major political events.\n\nThe amount of operating receivables as well as provisions for doubtful receivables are shown in note 17 'Trade receivables' to the consolidated financial statements on page 242.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe diversity of the Group's geographic presence across 78 countries, as well as the industries and sectors in which it works, helps distribute customer risk. The Group's entities serve a very large number of customers (more than two million worldwide) in a broad range of industries: chemicals, steel, metals, refining, food, pharmaceuticals, automotive, healthcare, electronics, photovoltaics, research laboratories, etc.\n\nThe Group's first customer represents less than 2% of revenue, the Group's top 10 customers represent around 10% of revenue and the top 50 customers represent around 25% of revenue.\n\nA significant part of the Industrial Gas business is covered by customer contracts, with commitment periods specific to the relevant business line:\n\n- \u25a0 the Large Industries business and a third of the Electronics business mainly rely on 15- to 20-year take-or-pay secured contracts, ensuring a guaranteed minimum revenue and offering strong future cash flow predictability;\n- \u25a0 the contracts in the Industrial Merchant business, generally with a duration of one to five-years, also include services relating to storage and cylinders over the lifetime of the supply contract;\n- \u25a0 in the Healthcare business, positions vary between health systems, with certain countries awarding one to five-year contracts on a regional and pathology basis following invitations to tender.\n\nFinally, the impact on the Group of the risks of customer business interruption following major climatic or political events is limited by the wide diversity of countries in which it operates. This impact can be offset by the necessary recourse to gases or equipment manufactured by the Group in critical situations. Gases are needed to secure industrial or chemical facilities (inert gases), maintain local industrial activity (essential to industrial processes) or even sustain life (medical gases and equipment). The Group's businesses are therefore often protected or prioritized depending on the situation.",

Financial risks\n\nThe Group's financial policy sets out the management principles for the financial risks to which its business is exposed. In this context, the Group has defined and regularly reviews the terms of the financial procedures which forbid speculative transactions notably on financial instruments.\n\nFinancial decision-making governance is the responsibility of the two Finance Committees (Strategic Finance Committee and Operational Finance Committee), with the former considering issues relating to the financing strategy and the latter dealing with the practical methods of its implementation.\n\n## 2.1. COUNTERPARTY AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nCounterparty risk primarily relates to trade receivables, outstanding amounts on short-term investments and derivative instruments for hedging, and to credit facilities contracted with each bank.\n\nTrade receivables risks relate to receivables on the balance sheet that may remain unpaid in the long term, in particular in the event of the financial hardship of a customer.\n\nInvestment risk is mainly related to short-term deposits in the event that one of the Group's key banks default and, to a lesser extent, an impairment loss due to use of SICAVs (open-ended investment companies) for a portion of the portfolio.\n\nHedging derivative risk relates to the positive market value of transactions which would be lost in the event of the default of one or more counterparties, and the need to substitute new hedges under potentially less favorable conditions.\n\nFinally, the main risk related to credit facilities is that the facility is unavailable in the case of a drawdown.\n\nNote 25.1 to the consolidated financial statements describes counterparty and liquidity risk for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nNotes 17.1 and 17.2 to the consolidated financial statements provide a breakdown of trade and other operating receivables and allowances for doubtful receivables.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nWith industrial projects and acquisition transactions, customer counterparty risk is one of the key elements assessed by the Resources and Investments Committees.\n\nFor long-term contracts, an assessment of a potential customer's credit profile is carried out before any contact is made. This assessment is then taken into account in the payment terms proposed to customers.\n\nFor the Group's major customers, counterparty risk is monitored on a monthly basis using ratings provided by financial rating agencies,\n\nor via an internal rating when there is no specific published rating available. The actual structure of contracts, in particular for Large Industries and Electronics, reduces risks in that these medium- to long-term contracts include safeguarding clauses for the Group.\n\nIn certain cases (mainly Europe and the United States), the risk of losses on trade receivables is transferred to the banks through non-recourse factoring programs.\n\nMoreover, to reduce risks relating to the default of a financial counterparty, the Group has adopted a conservative approach to its short-term investments and only works with leading banks and financial institutions rated at least A or A2 by Standard & Poor's or Moody's, except in exceptional and justified circumstances.\n\nInvestments must therefore be made with key banks, (i.e., leading banks selected according to their financing resources, their geographical and product coverage, as well as their financial stability) with maturities of less than three months, be highly liquid and have low volatility. The ratings of key banks and risk indicators available on the markets are monitored on a daily basis using real-time financial information services.\n\nCash pooling with the help of international cash pooling (a daily leveling system towards Air Liquide Finance) and the policy of annual extraction of subsidiaries' dividends also helps limit the amount of local cash in each country.\n\nTo minimize the risk relating to the market value of hedging derivatives used to manage currency and interest rate risk and that of fluctuations in raw material prices, the Group works with its key banks on one hand, while also ensuring it diversifies its transactions. These transactions are executed under framework agreements (French Banking Federation (FBF) and International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements). The Group has decided not to use a collateralization mechanism due to the low average duration of these derivatives and the cash fluctuations that may result from margin call mechanisms.\n\nFinally, in terms of financing, to ensure its development and independence, the Group ensures that it has sufficient and permanent sources of liquidity, meaning adequate financing resources available at any time and at the lowest cost from a large range of key banks and financial markets.",

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group, due to its international presence, is naturally exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with, on one hand, a transaction risk and, on the other hand, a risk relating to the translation of its financial statements into euros (the Group's reporting currency).\n\nForeign exchange transaction risk relates, on one hand, to the foreign currency commercial cash flows of operating entities and, on the other hand, cash flows arising from royalties, technical support and dividends.\n\nTranslation risk relates to the publication of the Group's financial statements in euros from the entities' financial statements in local currencies, without an impact on the profitability of the Group's businesses.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Airgas in the United States, the exposure of the Group's revenue and assets to the US dollar has increased, as has the Group's US dollar-denominated debt, with a risk linked to the translation of the financial statements:\n\n- \u25a0 large fluctuations in the value of the euro against the US dollar have a more significant impact on the Group's published results than before the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 these foreign exchange variations have an impact on the figures presented in the Group's balance sheet, particularly concerning the debt.\n\nNote 24.3 to the consolidated financial statements presents net debt by currency and note 25.1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the foreign exchange risk management process, as well as the derivative instruments used and sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nSince industrial and medical gases are not transported over long distances, most products are manufactured in the country where they are sold. The Group considers that its activities and its profitability have a low level of exposure to currency fluctuations.\n\nThe Group has nevertheless defined methods for hedging its main foreign exchange risks, whether this is borne by the holding companies or the operating entities, in terms of authorized hedging instruments, the decision process and the execution of transactions.\n\nThese measures are supplemented by management rules adapted to local circumstances, which are aimed at ensuring compliance and security of transactions and optimizing management.\n\nThe application of this financial policy is controlled by the Finance Department. The majority of transactions are executed directly on a centralized basis with the subsidiaries and over-the-counter markets, which is completed by consolidated Reports provided by various Group entities on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on the type of risk.\n\nThe activities are managed on the basis of highly separated duties, using a multilateral negotiation platform, cash management software, and a communication platform linked to the international banking communication network 'SWIFT'.\n\nFurthermore, the Group provides a natural hedge and reduces its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by raising debt in the currency of the cash flows generated to repay the debt. Thus, financing is raised either in local currency or, when sales contracts are indexed in euros or US dollars, in foreign currency (EUR or USD).",

INTEREST RATE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe interest rate risk is mainly linked to the fluctuation of future cash flows on debt when the rate is variable.\n\nIn case of a significant increase in interest rates upon future renewals of bonds, the Group may find itself obliged to devote a more significant portion of cash flows from its operational activities to service its debt.\n\nNote 24.4 to the consolidated financial statements presents the fixed-rate portion of debt and note 25.1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the sensitivity of the Group's financial expenses to interest rate fluctuations and the interest rate repricing schedule for fixed-rate debt and interest rate risk hedging instruments.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's strategy is to maintain, over a medium- to long-term period, a majority of total debt at fixed rates, notably by using firm or option hedges.\n\nCentralized interest rate hedging methods have also been defined for each major currency in which debt is held (in particular EUR, USD, JPY, and CNY, which represent around 90% of total net debt) including:\n\n- \u25a0 the selection of authorized tools, in particular swaps and interest rate options;\n- \u25a0 hedging decision processes;\n- \u25a0 methods of executing transactions.\n\nFor debt in other currencies, rules have been defined in order to ensure that the transactions initiated to hedge interest rate risk are consistent with Group objectives.\n\nMoreover, pre-hedging transactions for future highly probable issues are regularly implemented to protect the Group against an increase in interest rates.\n\nWith few exceptions, all interest rate transactions are centrally processed by Air Liquide Finance, and regularly valued using both internally designed tools and an independent specialized firm.\n\n## 2.4. RISKS INVOLVING CREDIT RATINGS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nTo gain access to capital markets, Air Liquide relies on the short-term and long-term financial credit ratings of Standard & Poor's and Moody's.\n\nLike all groups that are subject to ratings, Air Liquide could suffer a negative impact on its ability to finance its continuing operations and to refinance its debt should a rating agency significantly downgrade its rating below its current level, due to a higher level of debt than expected or for other credit-related reasons.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe ratings attributed by Standard & Poor's are A- long term with a Positive outlook and A-2 short term. Those attributed by Moody's are A-3 long term with a Stable outlook and P-2 short term.\n\nBoth agencies' models and adjustments have been replicated internally by the Group Treasury and Financing Department to be able to assess changes in key ratios presented to the agencies and identify any potential deviations.\n\nThis information is regularly presented to the Finance Committees and a Liquidity Report is shared with both agencies each quarter.",

TAX RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to tax risk in certain countries, due to changes in applicable regulations, which may have an impact on its activities or its results. This risk may arise from:\n\n- \u25a0 challenges in the application of current regulations or standards;\n- \u25a0 errors when completing tax returns;\n- \u25a0 regular audits by tax authorities which could lead to disagreements over the interpretation of facts.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, the Group focuses on complying with laws and regulations. Modifications of laws and regulations are followed and monitored by its Tax Department and its local Finance Departments.\n\nThe Group's tax Charter supports its ambition to remain a leader in its sector by acting in a responsible manner, consistent with the Group's long-term growth strategy. Air Liquide has defined the following principles which govern its tax policy, in line with article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code:\n\n- \u25a0 Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as well as the international standards that affect it such as those of the OECD, in particular on transfer prices;\n- \u25a0 Group entities ensure that tax returns and payments are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 the Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. It aims to operate in a transparent manner and build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities;\n- \u25a0 the Group deals with tax-related matters by banning tax havens and does not make use of shell corporations without economic or commercial substance;\n- \u25a0 the Group protects value for its shareholders by taking measures to minimize double taxation phenomena. Furthermore, it acts to minimize fiscal risk.\n\nIts tax strategy is in line with the Group's strategy and complies with the Code of Conduct.\n\nWithin this governance framework, the Group's tax affairs are managed by a team of dedicated, qualified tax experts, who work closely with management and respect the Group's values.\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A., on its own behalf and on behalf of its integrated French subsidiaries, is the first company to sign the 'Fiscal Partnership' with the French tax authorities. By signing this partnership in March 2019, L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries have entered a long-term trust-based, transparent relationship with the French tax authorities.",

DIGITAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group's activities, expertise and, more generally, its relations with all the stakeholders (suppliers, customers, banks, communities of experts, etc.) depend on increasingly dematerialized and digitized operations. These operations rely on interdependent information systems and communication networks both in functional, technical, as well as human level terms.\n\nThe Group's pursuit of this digital transformation increases its exposure to risks relating to data integrity, availability and confidentiality as well as the availability of IT systems and applications. For data confidentiality, the increase in expectations and requirements for protection also adds the risk of regulatory non-compliance.\n\nThese risks, which impact all economic and political players, are increasing in intensity due to the severity and frequency of digital attacks and to their changing nature (historically, cyber risks constituted industrial espionage or data hacking and have come to involve the risks of cyber criminality, malware and ransomware, where the user often plays a decisive role). These attacks, which spread at high velocity, have the potential to affect all of the Group's regions and businesses, with significant impacts on its industrial processes (disturbance of production or distribution activities), its capacity for communication, notably internal, and its image (digital identity theft, dissemination of false information, etc.).\n\nThe rise in homeworking also contributes to the Group's greater dependency on information systems and therefore to the increased consequences of a potential cyber attack.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Digital Security Policy sets the basic rules governing the identification of digital security issues and handling of associated risks, and outlines the roles and responsibilities in this area. It is accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 procedures describing, in particular, how to secure data and applications, detect and deal with incidents;\n- \u25a0 codes outlining principles to be respected by users and IT administrators.\n\nThe Digital Security Department reports directly to the Group Control and Compliance Department and uses resources set aside in the hubs, clusters (groups of countries), World Business Units and World Business Lines. This department coordinates and controls, in conjunction with the Digital & IT teams, the roll-out of this policy based on a risk assessment that is regularly updated according to the development of threats. This roll-out is centered on a long-term operational program aimed at defining the key areas and measures to be taken under the supervision of a member of the Executive Committee, with in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 risk prevention and awareness raising for employees regarding issues such as fraud and the theft of personal and confidential data, with teaching tools such as phishing campaigns, e-learning courses on information protection (notably personal or sensitive data) and use of IT tools. These risk-prevention measures are reinforced during periods of increased homeworking (remote access to IT systems);\n- \u25a0 greater consideration of Digital Security from the design phase of projects, as an inherent dimension of any resulting solution, and continued treatment of IT vulnerabilities, protection of critical applications and of the most sensitive information;\n- \u25a0 monitoring of digital threats, information leaks and major cyber incidents that could affect the Group's activities: this involves penetration testing (which is increasingly automated) and the implementation of a system to monitor information regarding Air Liquide which may have been leaked online;\n- \u25a0 implementing regulatory compliance for the organization using specific projects or programs such as the General Data Protection Regulation; for the latter, a framework agreement was drafted governing sharing of personal data within the Group, and a mechanism for the handling and processing of complaints was introduced;\n- \u25a0\n- revision of the incident management system completed by undertaking a diagnosis to assess the quality and efficiency of the protection of sensitive digital assets.\n\nMoreover, the Group has adapted its crisis management system to the specific characteristics of digital risks; it is also working on a multi-year program aimed at strengthening the digital protection of its industrial assets.",

CLIMATE RISKS (GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS)\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAlmost 85% of Air Liquide's large production units are Air Separation Units which do not use any combustion processes and consume almost exclusively electrical energy. Electricity used by the Group to power these units generate CO2 emissions at electricity suppliers which are known as indirect emissions.\n\nThe Group's other two main energy consuming activities are hydrogen production and cogeneration. These account for nearly 15% of large production units and use combustion processes emitting CO2 (direct emissions).\n\nAir Liquide's business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial gases needs of its customers who often emit large quantities of greenhouse gases, in particular in the metals, chemicals and refining industries. This outsourcing is justified by Air Liquide's expertise which allows them to optimize the energy consumption of production tools and favor low-carbon energy procurement. However, it leads to the transfer of the customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nIn this respect, the climate risk (greenhouse gas emissions) is closely linked to the access to renewable power sources and implementation by public authorities of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies such as, for example, the introduction of a carbon price or more stringent product regulations, that may impact either the Group's plants (direct impact on the operational scope), or those of its suppliers and customers (indirect impact on the value chain).\n\nAir Liquide is present in regions across the globe that have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes. In the event that the share of emissions covered by free allowances decreases, the Group may be required to introduce compensatory measures.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nAir Liquide plays a key role in limiting the environmental impact of the value chains in which the Group operates. The strategy and Climate Objectives that the Group have set therefore relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 its own production activities (improving the effectiveness of its operations, notably through the access to renewable energy sources and an increased use of digital tools, and expanding renewable energy procurement);\n- \u25a0 the environmental footprint of its customers by drawing on its technologies, expertise and investment capacity to co-develop solutions to limit their carbon impact (for example, through CO2 capture and storage);\n- \u25a0 its ecosystems by offering solutions to build a low-carbon society (development of hydrogen energy and biomethane).\n\nAt the operating level, these measures include key indicators which help measure and improve the environmental footprint of the Group and its ecosystems. These are subject to regular monitoring and are published in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration (Chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document).\n\nThe Group spends around 100 million euros every year on the energy transition.\n\nMoreover, thanks to its Engineering & Construction business line, the Group continuously improves the energy efficiency of its plants from the project design stage, in order to reduce their future impact. Air Liquide operates Air Separation Units and hydrogen units and therefore benefits from a virtuous circle of steady improvement from the design stage through to the units' operation. Old units are replaced by new ones that are more efficient in terms of the consumption of resources whenever circumstances enable it.\n\nAir Liquide has factored climate risk into its investment process by notably including a CO2 valuation in the economic analysis of new projects. This helps guide decision-making and better assess a project's resilience to a carbon constraint, by factoring in the potential financial impact of the risks identified.\n\nFinally, in regions across the globe that have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, quota systems for greenhouse gas emissions, specialized teams monitor and adapt to these regulatory changes to ensure that the Group's activities fully comply with these new regulations.",

CLIMATE RISKS (PHYSICAL IMPACT ON OPERATIONS)\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide does business in certain regions that are exposed to exceptional weather-related phenomena and/or climate change that may slow or interrupt activities or make them more expensive. The same applies to its suppliers and customers. These can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency and severity of which are increasing: storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic risks related to more long-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in their variability, the disappearance of certain resources, etc.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nPhysical risks (water availability, frequency of extreme events, etc.) are appraised during the review of investment requests, in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example in the design of equipment.\n\nIn addition, Group operations which are regularly exposed to the acute risks described above have risk management systems in place aimed at adopting suitable preventative operational measures and at managing these crises by, first and foremost, protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nChronic risks are taken into account, in particular in the design of production units, in the same way and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n\n## 4.3. DISCRIMINATION-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide operates businesses in a large number of countries with different cultures. It is therefore naturally exposed to discrimination risks relating in particular to gender mix (gender disparity, particularly in technical and expert professions), diversity and disability.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's Principles of Action and the key concepts of the Code of Conduct reaffirm the Group's values and, more specifically, a culture based on diversity, openness, transparency, respect for others and the rejection of all forms of discrimination. These values are also included in the Human Resources policy and must be promoted by all Group employees, with the support of Human Resources, through awareness-raising, training tools and the monitoring of progress indicators.\n\nMoreover, for several years, Air Liquide has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, for which one of the principles aims to contribute to the elimination of all forms of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nTo this effect, measures are regularly taken aimed at promoting gender mix (for example to increase the number of women among managers and professionals to 35%), nationality mix (Air Liquide's senior executives are now of 35 different nationalities), and inclusion (review of the policy relating to employees with disabilities).",

GEOPOLITICAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nConsidering the changing international climate, including increasing tensions between or in some countries and the terrorist threat, the Group may be exposed in certain countries to economic or financial risks, as well as to risks affecting the security of its facilities or safety of employees, either on-site or during business travel.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe diversity of the Group's sites, as well as the industries and sectors in which it works, helps reduce its exposure to geopolitical risks.\n\nWhen investment requests are reviewed, the geopolitical context of a project (in both safety and economic terms) is part of the criteria examined before any approval: country risk is thus assessed on a case-by-case basis and may lead to adjustments to financing strategy and supplementary insurance cover, or even the rejection of the project.\n\nMoreover, all countries in which the Group operates are subject to monitoring and a regular analysis of the geopolitical context.\n\nFinally, the Safety and Industrial System Department uses awareness-raising and training tools to protect employees, travelers and expatriates who are potentially exposed in certain regions or when traveling for business: e-learning, prior intervention from specialists on certain specific risks (health, hygiene, pollution, kidnapping, etc.). Other measures are also implemented to secure products and sites that are most exposed locally to an external threat.\n\n## 5.2.   REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nIn the large number of countries where the Group operates, its entities are exposed to the risk of non-compliance with local laws and regulations. In an increasingly complex context due to a continuously rising number of standards, they must monitor changes to the legal and regulatory framework notably in terms of the specificities of the businesses that they conduct.\n\nThe Healthcare business line, in particular, is subject to specific regulations for the products that it sells (medical devices, drugs), the research activities that it carries out, and the processing of patients' personal data.\n\nThe Group is faced, in all regions in which it operates, with risks of non-compliance with competition law, provisions aimed at combating corruption, as well as regulations restricting the export of certain products.\n\nGroup entities are also exposed to the risk of non-compliance with contractual obligations (of their own or those of their contractual counterparties).\n\nLiabilities and contingent liabilities related to disputes are described in notes 22 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Intellectual property-related risks\n\nThe external and global environment surrounding intellectual property points to a growth in patent activity as well as, in certain jurisdictions, greater attention to the protection of trade secrets. The Group's business is not dependent on technologies patented by third parties; it relies mainly on technologies, processes and designs developed internally by its innovation teams, Engineering & Construction, the World Business Lines and in the field. The resulting inventions are reviewed and systematically protected by patents, drawings and models, brands, or by other means. Innovation is increasingly achieved in partnership with third parties; in particular the Group develops innovative businesses through partnerships, buying shares in innovative entities, or acquisitions. In addition, third-party technologies can be incorporated in implementing its business.\n\nThis could lead to the risks of the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties (patents, utility models, copyright, design, etc.) - counterfeiting - in particular when several market players are working on similar technologies (especially in markets or technologies that are 'new' in general or 'new' for the Group). Risks may also arise from the processing of confidential third-party information as part of partnerships or during the development of digital solutions.",

These measures have been reinforced during the current pandemic which, with the urgent demand for medical supplies, the simplification of rules governing procurement, and the closure of certain borders, exposes the Group in certain regions to an increased risk of corruption;\n- \u25a0 various contract guides (for Large Industries, Industrial Merchant, Electronics, Engineering & Construction and Financing) and Codes of Good Practices (for Healthcare).\n\n## Intellectual property management measures\n\nGovernance relating to intellectual property and related risk management principles are set out in the Group Policy and procedures aimed at:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring Air Liquide's compliance with valid patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in its different areas of business, in particular through freedom to operate analysis;\n- \u25a0 protecting Group intellectual property assets, by protecting its inventions, designs and brands through their identification (on an official filing basis) and managing Group obligations in terms of the recognition of their inventors;\n- \u25a0 in the case of partnerships or other third-party relations, supporting stakeholders within the Group to manage risk relating to the protection of third-party rights;\n- \u25a0 raising awareness among Group employees of the risks relating to the intellectual property of third parties.\n\nTo this end, the Group relies on an Intellectual Property Department, comprising professionals located at the Group's head office and in the main geographic regions.\n\nTo the Group's knowledge, there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings which would be current or looming, which may have or have had, in the past 12 months, significant impacts on the Group's financial situation or profitability.",

Organization\n\nThe Group is organized and based on a consistent Group strategy. It is supported by a method of management which centers on mid-term objectives that are categorized by business, as well as a steering process for activities based on annual budgetary objectives, which are further categorized down to the individual plan level. As part of the NEOS company program, the Group has developed into a network organization that promotes communication and shortens decision-making circuits.\n\nThe organization breaks down into:\n\n- \u25a0 hubs which ensure the presence and representation of the Group in the main global regions. With the Base (L'Air Liquide S.A. Head Office), they are responsible for defining the Group's operational strategy and its global performance. They accommodate the representatives of the Corporate functions and World Business Lines who ensure that the Group strategy is properly implemented locally;\n- \u25a0 entities, grouped in clusters (groups of countries) for better pooling of resources, which provide operational management of their activities and implement the Group strategy in those countries where the Group has a presence;\n- \u25a0 the World Business Lines, which:\n- - with the hubs and Strategy Department, prepare the medium-term strategic goals for the businesses they represent,\n- - have responsibility for strategic marketing, the transformation of their respective businesses, industrial policy and the suitability of skills in their specific areas of business;\n- \u25a0 the World Business Units specific to certain businesses (Global Markets & Technologies, Engineering & Construction);\n- \u25a0 the Innovation & Development Division (IDD), which brings together all the research and innovation resources, technology development, Digital & IT (the Digital Factory, ALIZENT, network infrastructure and more) and the Global Markets & Technologies (GM&T) WBU mentioned above.\n\nThis organization also includes the Corporate functions, which notably comprise the three key control departments that report to Executive Management:\n\n- \u25a0 the Finance Department, which is responsible for:\n- - the reliability of accounting and financial information,\n- - the Group's financial and tax risk management,\n- - the drafting of Group objectives and monitoring of performance by operations control, based on financial data prepared by the accounting teams, analysis conducted by the financial teams of the various entities as well as certain operational data;\n- \u25a0 the Group Control and Compliance Department which:\n- - provides expertise and assistance to entities in their risk management approach (see below) and builds a Group synthesis,\n- - helps Group entities ensure compliance with and promotion of both the Group's ethical values, particularly through training and awareness-raising measures and the treatment of fraud and deviations (all these measures, organizations, and tools are presented in detail in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration), as well as compliance with duty of vigilance measures and with international trade regulations,\n\n- - verifies the effective application of internal control and risk management procedures through audits carried out according to a defined program presented to the Group's Audit and Accounts Committee. This program, developed and based on the risk analysis, is regularly monitored by the Audit and Accounts Committee in liaison with the Environment and Society Committee (for environmental and societal issues). Audit Reports are systematically supplemented by corrective action plans, which are supervised by a member of the Executive Committee. These Reports, as well as subsequent follow-up Reports, are the subject of various communications and periodic discussions with the Statutory Auditors,\n- - provides guidance to Group entities, through the Digital Security Department, which reports directly to the Group Control and Compliance Department, on the identification and protection of their data, systems, and digital applications (definition of rules, roll-out expertise and advice, control of proper implementation);\n- \u25a0 the Legal Department, which identifies legal risks, issues internal guidelines and Codes, and then oversees their proper implementation. It monitors the main disputes. and manages insurance.\n\nMoreover, the Group has a formal whistleblowing system at all its entities, whereby employees can anonymously alert an independent external service provider of any deviations from the Code of Conduct of their entity. Employees can file this alert in their own language by telephone or through the provider's dedicated website. All alerts filed are processed in a confidential manner under the supervision of the Ethics Officer, in line with the principle that any employee who reports something in good faith will not be sanctioned or have any retaliatory measures taken against them. This principle is guaranteed by the Group and reiterated in the Code of Conduct.\n\nThis system is an alternative solution to the usual process for reporting incidents within the entities: through managers and the Human Resources teams. It helps to accelerate the processing of reports received, and thus to minimize their potential impact on individuals and the organization. Details of the indicators relating to reports received and alerts are provided in the Vigilance Plan on page 116.\n\nFinally, this organization relies on a framework of authorizations and delegations:\n\n- \u25a0 to members of the Executive Committee and certain departments and services in order to define their commitment and payment powers for commercial transactions (sales or purchasing);\n- \u25a0 to certain executives in charge of entities or sites in France in particular, in order to ensure the prevention and management of industrial risks in terms of hygiene and safety;\n- \u25a0 to certain financial executives, in order to ensure the security of transactions and financial flows.\n\nThe managers of the various Group subsidiaries exercise their duties under the control of the Boards of Directors and in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in the countries where they operate.",

Risk management\n\nTo ensure the continued development of its activities, the Group must actively pursue an approach to prevent and manage the risks (especially industrial and financial risks) to which it is exposed.\n\nIn terms of the Group's business activities, industrial risk management must essentially focus on prioritizing safety and security while maintaining a permanent focus on the reliability of facilities.\n\nFinancial risk management requires strict control over investments, combined with prudent and rigorous practices regarding the accounting and financial aspects of the activities.\n\nThe Group's formal risk management approach aims to ensure:\n\n- \u25a0 the regular identification of the different forms of risk (industrial, financial and other) encountered by the Group during the pursuit of business activities, which are assessed according to both potential damage and probability of occurrence;\n- \u25a0 the assessment of the level of maturity of the management of each risk based on a common scale with respect to the quality of policies, organizational structures, processes and controls in place;\n- \u25a0 the progress of the main corrective action plans undertaken to mitigate these risks, by focusing monitoring activities on a limited number of priorities.\n\nThis three-phase risk management process (mapping, maturity level assessment, mitigation plans) covers over 70 entities representing more than 90% of consolidated Group revenue.\n\n## 3. Internal control\n\nIn addition to the Principles of Action, (https://www.airliquide.com/ group/groups-principles-action) which reaffirm the Group's values with particular reference to stakeholders (shareholders, suppliers and customers, employees, etc.), the Group's policies, Codes, and procedures are grouped together in a global reference manual, the BlueBook, which is available to employees on the Intranet. They constitute a set of internal control and risk management documents, which must be implemented by each entity included in the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe BlueBook is the cornerstone of the Group's internal control system, which aims to ensure that:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's activities and the conduct of its employees:\n- - comply with laws and regulations, internal standards and applicable best practices,\n- - comply with the objectives defined by the Company, especially in terms of risk prevention and management policies,\n- - contribute to safeguarding the Group's assets;\n- \u25a0 all financial and accounting information communicated either internally or externally gives a true and fair view of the situation and activity of the Group and complies with prevailing accounting standards.\n\nGenerally, the Group's internal control system should help better master its activities, the efficiency of its operations and the efficient use of its resources.\n\nAs with other 'assurance systems', it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the Group's objectives will be met.\n\nIn 2020, the Group pursued the actions undertaken in previous years, with more than 70 material Group entities and shared service platforms (representing over 90% of consolidated Group revenue), reviewing the appropriateness of their internal control system in relation to\n\nThe Risk Management Department within the Group Control and Compliance Department leads this approach using:\n\n- \u25a0 resources dedicated by the hubs, World Business Units and World Business Lines to manage the approach in their respective scopes of responsibility (under the supervision of the Boards of Directors of the entities concerned) and to provide a summary thereof;\n- \u25a0 the work of members of the Risk Committee that it coordinates (described on page 94).\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee reviews Group risk management based on presentations covering:\n\n- \u25a0 the progress of the approach (on an annual basis);\n- \u25a0 each major risk management system based on a multi-year program structured according to the challenges;\n- \u25a0 internal audit summaries of these risk management systems.\n\nIn terms of environmental and societal risks, these are reviewed by the Environment and Society Committee, which meets once a year, as part of a joint session with the Audit Committee.\n\nFinally, an annual summary of risk management actions undertaken by the Group is presented to the Board of Directors; each year it validates the Audit and Accounts Committee's provisional program which is presented to it beforehand, as well as a list of subjects of strategic interest or with particular relevance that will be presented in a more specific manner.\n\nthe Reference Framework for internal control and risk management systems. These entities also implemented actions aimed at improving their control system in terms of annual guidelines defined at the beginning of the year by the hubs and World Business Units, the Group Control and Compliance Department and the Finance Department. The latter two together organize these improvement measures and report on their progress to the Group's Executive Management then to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nAudits are coordinated by the Group Control and Compliance Department and the Statutory Auditors, based on a joint work program, to verify the assessments of the internal control processes and the correct implementation of key operating controls.\n\n## RECENT MEASURES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE SYSTEM\n\nIn 2020, the Group continued its measures to improve the quality of its internal control and risk management system, with in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 in terms of industrial safety:\n- - the creation of an Industrial and Safety Committee; the purpose of this Committee, which is chaired by a member of the Executive Committee, is to further reinforce the Group's safety performance and the management of certain industrial risks; the participation of all industrial departments aims, notably, to maximize across the Group as a whole the lessons learned from certain incidents;\n- \u25a0 in terms of governance:\n- - the expansion of the Ethics Committee (renamed the Ethics and Compliance Committee) which also covers compliance issues which are not specific to a given activity, such as competition law, export controls, the protection of personal data (GDPR) and the Vigilance Plan. The Group Control Department (renamed",

This tool allows managers to take ownership  of this new framework including remote team management, a structured homeworking policy, the design of work spaces, and an in-depth review of our interaction with our customers and patients.\n\n## 4. Financial and accounting information\n\nIn order to guarantee the quality and reliability of financial and accounting information produced, the Group primarily relies on a set of accounting principles and standards, as well as a consistent accounting and management reporting system and feeds both the Group statutory consolidation process and the management analysis that is under the responsibility of independent departments, which report to the Finance Department.\n\nThe Group accounting manual, which includes the Group financial policy, defines the accounting rules and principles as well as the consolidation methods applicable and states the formats applicable for reporting financial and accounting information. This manual is regularly updated by the Finance Department with the amendments to IFRS or their interpretations.\n\nManagement and Accounting Reports are each prepared under the responsibility of independent but interactive departments that follow identical methods and principles:\n\n- \u25a0 this independence allows for the enhancement of information and analysis through the use of complementary indicators and data, particularly those which are specific to each business;\n- \u25a0 the fact that these bodies are interactive provides for better control of the reliability of information through the systematic and regular reconciliation of data.\n\nThe reports primarily include:\n\n- \u25a0 monthly management reporting, known as the 'Monthly Flash Report', that provides information on revenue and the main financial indicators: income statement, cash flow from operating activities, net debt and the amount of investments authorized and committed;\n- \u25a0 quarterly reporting, known as the 'Management Control Report', which provides details of the primary items of the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement;\n- \u25a0 a quarterly 'variance' analysis report to assess the various components of the change in operating income recurring.\n- These three documents are compiled by each management entity according to a predefined yearly timetable.\n- They are systematically accompanied by comments on activities drawn up under the supervision of the entity's Chief Executive Officer, and are consolidated at Group level with a breakdown for each hub and business;\n\n- \u25a0 quarterly reporting for accounting consolidation is compiled by each subsidiary which, in addition, must provide (on a semi-annual basis) information on off-balance sheet commitments that include in particular:\n- - energy purchasing,\n- - financial guarantees and deposits;\n- - all other contractual commitments.\n\nAccounting consolidation statements and monthly reporting are escalated to the Central Consolidation Department. This department prepares the consolidated data and works in conjunction with the Operations Control Department, whose duty it is to analyze and comment on the results, identify and explain any differences with respect to forecasts, and update said forecasts. Meetings are organized each month with the heads of hubs and clusters (groups of countries) to clarify these analyses.\n\nAs part of the scope of the Group Performance Steering Committee, a rolling forecast for the rest of the current year is systematically presented by the Finance Department, in order to identify, when applicable, any differences with respect to yearly targets and take the necessary steps.\n\nThrough regular controls, the Finance Department ensures the effective application of accounting methods and principles in the various Group entities. The most complex accounting standards, particularly those relating to employee benefits (IAS 19R), methods of consolidation (IFRS 10/11), the classification of major Large Industries' contracts (IFRS 15) and derivative financial instruments (IAS 32, IFRS 7, IFRS 9) as well as the implementation of new standards, are subject to greater support and tighter controls or to direct treatment by the Finance Department.\n\nIt also relies on audits carried out by the Group Control and Compliance Department, with which it has regular contact.\n\nThe quality and reliability of financial and accounting information also depend on information systems which are increasingly integrated (such as ERP), and in a Group consolidation software package.\n\nThe project, which aims to further harmonize ERPs, continues on the basis of the definition of an accounting and financial framework tailored to the various Group businesses.",

The amount insured for each subsidiary in its policy depends notably on the amount of its revenue. The coverage under the Group's umbrella policy is supplemental to any local amounts.\n\nThis captive reinsurance company covers, for the 2020 fiscal year, claims of up to a maximum of 34 million euros with sub-limits per claim adapted to the nature of the claim.

This plan must include 'reasonable vigilance measures to identify the risks and prevent severe impacts on Human Rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of persons and on the environment' which may result from the activities of the Group and its subsidiaries, and those of suppliers or subcontractors with whom Air Liquide has an established commercial relationship. This obligation is based on five measures:\n\n- \u25a0 risk mapping (identification, analysis, prioritization);\n- \u25a0 procedures to regularly assess the situation of subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors;\n- \u25a0 appropriate action to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts;\n- \u25a0 an alert mechanism that collects reporting of potential or actual risks;\n- \u25a0 a monitoring scheme to follow up on the measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the requirements of the Law on the Duty of Vigilance by reporting on the various measures implemented for each stake: Human Rights and fundamental freedoms (paragraph 2.), the health and safety of individuals (paragraph 3.), and the environment (paragraph 4.). As specific measures apply to the management of suppliers and subcontractors, the risks, procedures and measures implemented in this regard are set out in paragraph 5. Two measures, risk mapping (paragraph 1.) and the setup of an alert mechanism and collection of reports (paragraph 6.), apply transversally to all three stakes and are presented independently to facilitate their reading.\n\nAir Liquide's ambition is to lead its industry, deliver long-term performance and contribute to sustainability. The Company's customer-centric transformation strategy aims at profitable, steady and responsible growth over the long term. It relies on operational excellence, on selective investments, on open innovation and on a network organization already implemented by the Group worldwide in 78 countries. Through the commitment and the inventiveness of its 64,500 employees in responding to challenges in energy and environmental transition, in healthcare and in digitization, Air Liquide focuses on increasing value creation for all its stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis Vigilance Plan applies to L'Air  Liquide S.A. and all Group subsidiaries.\n\n## STEERING AND GOVERNANCE OF THE DUTY OF VIGILANCE\n\nAs an extension to the Group's commitment to subjects related to the duty of vigilance, Executive Management decided to create a dedicated role within the Group Control and Compliance Department to strengthen the coordination of these subjects. One person was thus appointed in 2020 to oversee the implementation of vigilance obligations to which Air Liquide is subject. This mission notably includes coordinating the structure of the Vigilance Plan to better meet the expectations of the Group's stakeholders and to issue recommendations to the various departments involved. Progress is regularly monitored by Executive Management.\n\nThe Procurement, Group Control and Compliance, Sustainable Development, Legal, Human Resources, and Safety and Industrial Systems Departments contributed to monitoring and drafting this Vigilance Plan.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee, which widened its scope in June 2020 and now includes the duty of vigilance, monitors progress regarding the Vigilance Plan. It brings together the Group Control and Compliance, Sustainable Development, Legal and Human Resources Departments as well as a representative of operational functions who is a member of the Group's Executive Committee and meets at least twice a year and more often when required. In 2020, the Committee reviewed the progress of the mission related to the duty of vigilance on two occasions.\n\nThe Environment and Society Committee is one of the Board of Directors' special committees dedicated to social and environmental issues. This Committee was created in 2017; it includes three members and meets at least three times a year. In 2020, it continued to supervise the roll out of the Vigilance Plan.",

This commitment is reiterated in the general statement of the Principles of Action, which were adopted in 2006 and revised in 2016. These Principles are shared with all employees and are available on the Group's website (https://www.airliquide.com/group/groups-principlesaction). Air Liquide is committed to its customers and patients, shareholders, employees, the environment, local communities, its suppliers and partners.\n\nIn addition to these Principles of Action, the Group has also adopted key concepts, which are included in the Code of Conduct (revised in 2016, which is due to be updated in 2021) which each subsidiary adapts by drafting its own Code of Conduct in its working language. These key concepts are also available on the Air Liquide website\n\n(https://www.airliquide.com/group/code-conduct-key-concepts). They cover in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 respect for laws and regulation;\n- \u25a0 respect for people in terms of health and safety, discrimination in the workplace, and the respect of third parties;\n- \u25a0 respect for the environment;\n- \u25a0 transparency and integrity of information;\n- \u25a0 implementation of the Code of Conduct;\n- \u25a0 sanctions in the event of violation of the Code of Conduct.\n\nFinally, Air Liquide also supports several international and sector initiatives. The Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact (UN Global Compact, https://www.unglobalcompact.org/participation/report/cop/ create-and-submit/active/444628) since 2014, and has committed to sustainably adopt the ten principles relating to Human Rights, international labor standards, the environment and the fight against corruption within the Group's strategy and operations. The Group is also a signatory of the Responsible Care \u00ae Global Charter, an initiative of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA, https://icca-chem. org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Signatories-of-RC-Global-Charter.pdf) which aims to improve global performances in the chemical industry in terms of health, safety and the protection of the environment.\n\nThrough its activities and its engagement, Air Liquide contributes to certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that the United Nations has set up to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. To illustrate the Group's contribution, the appropriate actions to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts, described in paragraphs 2.3., 3.3. and 4.3., are associated with the corresponding SDGs.\n\n## 1. Risk mapping - methodology for the assessment of the Group's operations\n\nSince 2018, Air Liquide has introduced a risk assessment mechanism, which meets the duty of vigilance. The risk identification process takes both local characteristics and emerging issues into account. These risks are assessed by the clusters (groups of countries) according to their\n\nimpact and probability of occurrence. A summary of this assessment is reviewed at the central Group level with the help of experts, in particular for safety, climate and water management-related subjects.\n\nFinally, a summary of all work carried out is presented to the Group Risk Committee. It includes the following risks:\n\n| Duty of vigilance stakes              | Associated risks Discrimination                                       |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Human Rights and fundamental freedoms | Labor law                                                             |\n| Health and safety of individuals      | Health, safety and security of individuals                            |\n| Environment                           | Greenhouse gas emissions Water management (consumption and discharge) |\n\nDetails of risks by stake are presented in paragraphs 2.1., 3.1., and 4.1.",

Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAir Liquide Group is committed to the highest possible standards in terms of conducting its business, notably with respect for Human Rights and social rights.\n\n## 2.1. RISK MAPPING\n\nRisks related to the Group's societal impact, in particular with regard to Human Rights and fundamental freedoms, include:\n\n- \u25a0 discrimination-related risks: Air Liquide carries out activities with high technological content in a large number of countries with different cultures. Challenges relating to discrimination mainly with regard to gender equality (gender disparity, in particular in technical or expert occupations), disability, origin, religion or age could affect employees of the Group or of its partners;\n- \u25a0 labor law-related risks: Air Liquide contributes to economic and social growth in 78 countries where it operates through its technical, industrial, medical and economic activities. The Group therefore identifies the applicable laws and regulations, in particular in terms of working conditions, child labor and the freedom of trade unions.\n\n## 2.2. REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\nAir Liquide has introduced provisions aimed at ensuring compliance with the international rules of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in terms of labor law and follows the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for multinational enterprises. These promote an ethical and responsible approach by companies in their activities and professional relations, in particular in terms of human rights, by encouraging the implementation of due diligence procedures. Safety, ethics and respect for human rights are prerequisites for achieving a high-quality work environment. Each Group entity defines, in agreement with employee representative bodies and in line with local regulations, legal working hours which encourage engagement and performance.\n\nOne of the focuses of the Human Resources strategy consists of building an inclusive and collaborative structure capable of addressing the challenges of a continuously changing world.\n\nTo assess and manage discrimination-related risks, Air Liquide rolled out in the past a policy based on four cornerstones: age, gender, disability and nationality. To cover the various forms of diversity and promote a more inclusive culture, Air Liquide is changing its policy, striving to fight against any form of discrimination.\n\nDiversity is a priority of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy and policy and the Group considers it as a source of dynamism, creativity and performance. It is a fundamental element of the organization, in terms of both operations and employees, and drives the Group's long-term performance. Established at the Group level, this policy is then applied locally in the subsidiaries.\n\nObjectives at the central level include enhancing diversity among managerial staff to better value the various cultures on which Air Liquide is built and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified gender equality targets have been set for the Group and its entities.\n\nAt the entity level, the aim is for teams to be made up of employees who represent the setting in which they work. Each entity is therefore responsible for the implementation of specific action plans adapted\n\nto its circumstances and legal framework, which can cover various forms of diversity (race, color, origin, religion, sexual orientation etc.).\n\nFurthermore, the alert mechanism (EthiCall and EthicsPoint described in paragraph 6.) enables Human Resources to track the number of alerts related to these risks and to risks related to labor law in general.\n\n## 2.3. APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n## 2.3.1. Discrimination-related risks\n\nA team within Human Resources is responsible for managing diversity projects. The Group's roadmap is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 deploying the diversity objectives in all entities and ensuring the implementation of all related action plans;\n- \u25a0 improving all of the Group's Human Resources processes to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promoting an inclusive culture to leverage the diversity of the teams.\n\nAn example of this roadmap is the implementation of a new measure to combat harassment and intimidation planned for January 2021 in the United States. Each year, the 17,000 employees at the Airgas subsidiary will receive training to promote a positive working environment and prevent discrimination in the workplace, but also in any professional situation outside of the workplace such as, for example, during business trips, meetings and events sponsored by the Company.\n\n## Gender equality\n\nThe Group has set several ambitious gender equality objectives aimed at achieving:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 a rate of 35% of women among 'Managers and Professionals' by 2025. This objective is in line with the results obtained over the past ten years which have enabled the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group to increase from 26 to 30%;\n- \u25a0 a rate of 25% of women in Executive positions by 2025, versus 21% currently.\n\nThe various Human Resources processes are reviewed to encourage diversity, in particular gender equality within the Group. For example, the recruitment process allows the Group to strengthen the place of women within the Company, and the career development process ensures that the list of candidates for a new position always includes at least one woman.\n\nFinally, promoting a culture of inclusion helps leverage the diversity of the Group's talents. Awareness-raising programs and discussions are organized within the Group's entities: dedicated days organized to raise awareness and promote manager involvement, 'champions' networks, the sharing of best practices, and the implementation of communities in networks that favor gender equality. Several events were thus organized across the Group in March 2020 just after International Women's Day, to promote diversity and inclusion.",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\n## Equal pay\n\nFighting other forms of discrimination\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn France, the law dated September 5, 2018, relating to the freedom to choose one's professional future, stipulates that all companies with more than 50 employees must complete an annual gender pay gap review, which will result in a social rating being\n\npublished for the Company (out of 100 points). This Index and the five related indicators must also be made available to the Social and Economic Committee and be transmitted to the Labor administration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, the Group's 30 companies with at least 50 employees in France were audited as in 2019. The weighted average gender equality workforce Index stands at 87.9/100, showing an increase of 2.9 points compared to 2019. L'Air Liquide S.A. published its\n\nequal pay Index for the third year, reaching 99/100 (it was 98/100 in 2019 and 82/100 in 2018).\n\nOutside of France, the Group initiated a process in 2019 to assess the gender pay gap in entities with more than 400 employees. Based on the initial results, a global process will be defined and regularly rolled out.\n\n## The inclusion of disability - one of our priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe aim of the HandivAirsity initiative, which was launched on a European level in 2017, is to encourage diversity by integrating employees with disabilities within the Group's teams and involving its entire ecosystem: employees, suppliers, customers and\n\nstakeholders. The signing of the HandivAirsity Charter by employees is the first step towards supporting this initiative. A HandivAirsity Challenge was launched and aimed at developing and awarding projects promoting disability within the Group's entities. Despite the covid-19 pandemic, 36 European projects were launched in 16 countries as part of the 2020 edition.\n\nEvery effort is made to support employees with a disability within Air Liquide: ergonomic assessments, adapting workstations, special equipment, interfaces, training, active awareness-raising among personnel such as for example within the Air Liquide France Industrie subsidiary, with events such as DuoDay, European week, the inclusive Hackathon, handilearning, a toll-free number, challenges and newsletters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWithin a scope covering around 5,500 employees based in France, a fifth Disability agreement for a period of three years (2020-2022) was signed at the end of 2019. The aim of this agreement is to continue with measures already implemented in favor of people with disabilities and thus further improve the direct employment rate to reach 4.2% in 2022 vs 3.3% in 2018.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeasures are also in place to help contribute to 'indirect' employment, which corresponds to the purchase of goods and services from companies in the adapted and protected sector (STPA) and from independent workers with disabilities, despite the fact\n\nthat this contribution is no longer factored into the overall employment rate. In France, in 2020, 1.3 million euros was declared to the AGEFIPH (the French association managing the funds for the professional integration of people with disabilities). Since 2018, Air Liquide has organized three annual editions of the 'STPA Business Meeting' bringing together Air Liquide key players and STPA companies to promote solidarity procurement. In 2020, the 'STPA Business Meeting' was held online due to the covid-19 pandemic. 110 individuals and 10 suppliers took part.\n\nActions have been launched to improve local procedures in the subsidiaries to combat other forms of discrimination.\n\n## IN SOUTH AFRICA, AIR LIQUIDE PROMOTES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FROM THE RECRUITMENT STAGE\n\nFor example, to promote equal opportunity regardless of race and to avoid nepotism, the recruitment process in South Africa has been strengthened. Questions have been added to the selection framework to verify the candidate's lack of personal ties with a company employee. The candidate is then asked to provide an official statement during the job interview.\n\n## IN THE UNITED STATES, AIR LIQUIDE PROMOTES A MORE INCLUSIVE CULTURE\n\nIn the United States, in order to develop a more inclusive culture, communities in networks called 'Business Resource Groups' are created to promote diversity, in particular with regards to women, veterans, African-Americans, LGBTa, Hispanic and Asian Americans. Moreover, the right to sexual difference is provided for in the 2021 local policy update and it will introduce the risk of harassment between people of the same sex.\n\n## 2.3.2. Labor law-related risks\n\n## Relations with social partners\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide is committed to maintaining a high-quality social dialog across all of its subsidiaries. This comes in different forms according to local regulations.\n\nIn Europe, the European Works Council has 29 employee representatives from 13 countries. It was renewed in 2017 for a term of four years. In 2020, seven plenary meetings chaired by a member of the Executive Committee were held, as well as five other meetings of the Council's board members. The main themes discussed during information and consultation\n\nmeetings are safety, news on the Group's activities, especially in Europe, the financial results, the well-being and psychological health of employees, the industrial strategy and its implementation in the different countries in which Air Liquide operates.",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\nIn France, the Group has sought to improve social dialog for two years, using a debate and project development approach as part of a collaborative initiative. Two social seminars were held to promote working together (employee representatives/trade unions and management/HR) towards a new ambition. This exercise helped define a roadmap and transformation projects:\n\n- \u25a0 anticipating the management of the employability of Group employees in addition to the agreements for forward planning of employment and skills ('Gestion pr\u00e9visionnelle des emplois et des comp\u00e9tences, GPEC');\n- \u25a0 improving the employee representatives pathway within Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 initiating discussions on the prevention of psychosocial risks.\n\nIn 2020, the social dialogue continued in spite of the public health crisis. Negotiations with social partners about employability will begin in 2021 with the aim of concluding a company-wide agreement in France.\n\nThe reflections on psychosocial risks carried out during the European Works Council meetings have resulted in the production of the 'Care & Perform' Charter described in the paragraph below, 'Well-being at work'.\n\nIn addition, 2020 was largely devoted to managing the public health crisis with employee representatives. It was characterized by ongoing and strengthened social dialogue with bodies such as the Social and Economic Committee, the France Group committee, the European Works Council and the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee.\n\nIn September 2020, a presentation of the duty of vigilance approach was shared with the France Group committee, which includes representatives from all French entities.\n\n## IN THE UNITED STATES, AIRGAS IS COMMITTED TO AN OPEN AND CONTINUOUS DIALOG WITH THE LABOR UNIONS\n\nAround 50 collective agreements have been negotiated covering subjects including union security, management rights, overtime, health and wellbeing, working hours, public holidays, paid vacations, pay rises, discipline and dismissal.\n\n## Well-being at work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group ensures the building of a performancefocused, attractive and collaborative professional environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of employees in the workplace.\n\nFocus groups have been set up aiming at promoting the work-life balance of employees to strengthen their occupational well-being. This approach meets employees' expectations on this subject. These practices were incorporated into principles that were jointly developed with European social partners. In 2019, the Group developed the 'Care & Perform' initiative, in partnership with the European Works Council, which aims at preventing psychosocial risks. This initiative led to the drawing up of a charter based on principles of action relating to improving organization, workload and the work-life balance of employees.\n\nMore generally, within the context of changes to the Group's organizational models, which were accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, Air Liquide launched a global project in 2020 called 'Next Normal' to build on this shift in working methods. This project will allow entities to promote a new working framework for their employees, including team management, a structured homeworking policy, the design of work spaces, and an in-depth review of the interaction with customers and patients.\n\nThe Group has also launched an internal program called MyVoice to measure the engagement of employees. This program aims to improve the experience and well-being of employees within the Group. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act. Following the launch of the initiative in Asia Pacific in 2019, feedback is now collected from employees throughout the Group each year to help better understand their expectations, identify and introduce appropriate measures and thus significantly improve their commitment.\n\nA short, twenty-question survey is sent to each employee with room to leave comments if desired. These questions cover subjects including safety, work-life balance, career prospects, inclusion, autonomy, professional development and trust. Answers are fully anonymous to ensure complete freedom of speech. Results are collected in real time, aggregated and analyzed in a central platform for the entire Group. Each manager has access to the results from his or her team - provided that the thresholds needed to guarantee confidentiality are respected.\n\nAs of 2020, the survey is sent out each year in order to measure the impact of any action taken, as well as the change in employees' engagement over time. With MyVoice, Air Liquide aims to offer each employee a successful professional experience, by favoring listening and dialog, at each stage of their careers as Group employees. The importance attached by the Group to the employee experience is a key factor in terms of job attractiveness, retaining talent and the job satisfaction of employees.\n\n## 2.4. MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nIn terms of gender equality, Air Liquide has created its own protocol to define its reporting methods for Human Resources. This protocol includes all the definitions, measurement procedures and collection methods for this information. Each month, the subsidiaries update the indicators in the Group's reporting tool.\n\nThe Group ensures that social dialog is encouraged and, as part of this, 81% of Group employees had access to a representation, dialog or consultation structure in 2020.\n\nHuman Resources indicators are consolidated twice a year for all companies included in the financial consolidation scope. The Human Resources Committee, represented by the Group's largest operational departments, meets six to eight times a year to monitor measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\n| 2025 Objectives                                                    | 2025 Objectives   | 2020  Results   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Increase the percentage of women among  managers and professionals | 35%               | 30%             |\n| Increase the percentage of women   in Executive positions          | 25%               | 21%             |\n| 2020 Objective                                                     |                   | 2020  Result    |\n| Response rate for the 2020 MyVoice survey                          | 75%               | 80%             |",

Health and Safety / Security\n\nSafety is a fundamental value for the Group and the 'zero accidents, on every site, in every region, in every entity' ambition remains a key priority. The Group, as a responsible industry player, is therefore committed to efficiently and under all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, subcontractors, customers, patients and suppliers to professional and industrial risks.\n\nThe safety results for the past 30 plus years illustrate the long-term effectiveness of the Group's actions in this area.\n\n## 3.1. RISK MAPPING\n\n## 3.1.1. Industrial risks that may affect individuals\n\nIndustrial risks are linked to the various industrial products, processes and distribution methods implemented by the Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\nOver and above the usual risks inherent in all industrial activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks that may affect individuals. These are related to:\n\n- \u25a0 products: the intrinsic properties of industrial gases manufactured, transformed or packaged by the Group classifies them in the dangerous materials category;\n- \u25a0 processes and their operation: cryogenics is used to separate gases by distillation, store them and transport them. This very low temperature technique requires specific means of control and protection to avoid in particular:\n- - cryogenic burns associated with liquefied gases,\n- - anoxia, associated with inert gases,\n- - over-oxygenation or fires, associated with oxygen and oxygen mixtures.\n\nThe same applies for high temperature techniques, used in particular in the production of hydrogen, which are particularly exposed to risks of fire or explosions.\n\nIn addition, pressure is central to the Group's processes. Pressurized equipment must be designed with safety devices, which limit the risk of accidents caused by an uncontrolled increase of pressure;\n\n- \u25a0 logistics and transportation: each year, delivery vehicles, sales staff and technicians travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Non-compliance with the traffic regulations or the lack of regular maintenance of vehicles would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents. In addition, industrial sites use a lot of motorized lifting equipment, which present specific risks (collision, falling packaging, etc.). Training and authorization are thus required to operate them;\n- \u25a0 engineering and construction: industrial risks are factored in and must commence at the design phase of future installations. During the construction phase, the lack of a strict accident prevention framework would affect the coordination among the various stakeholders and expose teams to risks of accidents;\n- \u25a0 delivery reliability: the Group is exposed to the risk of faults in the systems supplying gas to customers, which could lead to a disruption to supply, in terms of quality or volumes, which could notably have an impact on a patient's health;\n- \u25a0 specific standards and regulations, in particular in Healthcare, with the risk of non-compliance of products and services provided to patients.\n\nLogistics and road transport, as well as manufacturing processes represent major exposure for individuals to the corresponding risks. These risks are subject to dedicated action programs, which are described in paragraph 3.3.\n\n## 3.1.2. Risks related to the security of individuals\n\nRisks related to the security of individuals are mainly triggered by business travel: security risks during trips to foreign countries, but also public health risks in certain countries affected by 'rare diseases' or with medical and hospital infrastructure that is considered 'at risk'.\n\nIn tangible terms, these risks concern all forms of travel and are related, for example:\n\n- \u25a0 before departure, to the lack of information regarding a destination country and the best practices to be implemented;\n- \u25a0 upon arrival, to recommendations relating to how to recognize the host and to means of transport;\n- \u25a0 during the trip, to the choice of accommodation and means of transport;\n- \u25a0 to health recommendations (and food safety) which vary according to regions;\n- \u25a0 to physical security recommendations which vary according to the country and its political and social context;\n- \u25a0 to information regarding the available means of seeking medical advice, a consultation, hospitalization, or even a medical evacuation.\n\nThe same approach was therefore used for those traveling during the global public health crisis due to the covid-19 pandemic: information, guidance, travel recommendations and measures adjusted for each individual and each country. The Group's duty to protect its employees is also applied in the same way to stakeholders (service providers and subcontractors) when they intervene at the request of Air Liquide, regardless of the country.\n\nOverall, the risk level of each country is decided on by the Security Department. It is based on the official rating of five countries (France, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Australia), coupled with an assessment by a security service provider. The occurrence of serious or repetitive events results in a review of the country's risk level. The final validation of this level is the responsibility of the country manager. To date, for the countries in which Air Liquide is present, three are classified as very high risk (Nigeria, Mali and Burkina Faso) and nine are high risk. The others are split between moderate and low risk.\n\nFinally, the protection of sites against malicious attacks contribute to the protection of the individuals who work at these sites, as well as that of local residents and customers. Any intrusion at a site, regardless of the motive (simple theft or an act of terrorism), creates a disturbance or major damage that will have an impact on the work of employees. Depending on the nature of the offense, the act committed may also have an impact on the safety of local residents, or customers who may suffer delivery problems.",

        "page_content": "Vigilance Plan\n\n## 3.2. REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\nTo assess and manage these risks, the Group has an Industrial Management System (IMS), which operates based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the accountability of the departments of the various Group entities for the effective implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 the issue of key management and organizational procedures that aim to ensure:\n- - compliance with standards and regulations,\n- - design management,\n- - industrial risk management,\n- - hygiene, health and environmental management,\n- - the training and certification of personnel,\n- - the management of operating and maintenance procedures,\n- - the management of industrial purchasing,\n- - change management,\n- - the analysis and treatment of incidents and accidents,\n- - the dissemination of shared technical standards within Group entities.\n\nThe IMS document base is continuously updated and enriched.\n\n## 3.2.1. Industrial risks that may affect individuals\n\nThe Safety and Industrial Systems Department and the Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines supervise and control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 the presentation of various dashboards designed to monitor performance in terms of safety;\n- \u25a0 process audits to verify the implementation conditions and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 throughout safety reviews prior to the start-up of any new facility to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical audits carried out by the Industrial Departments to ensure the compliance of operations with Group rules.\n\nThis regular assessment of industrial risks that may affect individuals covers all Group activities in all geographic regions. The frequency of these assessments is adapted to each subject. For example, monthly safety performance reviews or an annual review of technical audits. Other subjects require that assessments be carried out at specially adapted intervals, as for example in the case of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## 3.2.2. Risks related to the security of individuals\n\nIn terms of the security of industrial and commercial facilities, regular visits are carried out on site. The purpose of these visits is to ensure the correct application of the processes set out in the document base. They are usually carried out in each region, with the involvement of the Head of Security. A report is drawn up after each country visit and sent to the entity.\n\nFor example, over the past two years, 27 sites (of which 11 major) in nine countries (including Mali and Nigeria, countries classified as very high risk), were visited by the Head of Security, accompanied by the Safety Officer for the geographic region in question.\n\n## 3.3. APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.3.1. Industrial risks that may affect individuals\n\nAir Liquide relies on continuous actions to raise the awareness of its teams through specific training in the mitigation of industrial risks that may affect individuals. Not only are all employees trained in relation to risks relating to their own business line, they are also, more generally, trained in the Group's safety culture.\n\nSince their creation in 2013, Air Liquide is committed to ensuring that its 12 key safety rules are complied with at each site and at all times. The interpretation and meaning of each rule is widely shared. Non-compliance with one of the 12 key safety rules is a serious violation, which, depending on the circumstance, may lead to sanctions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs identified in the mapping, two risks represent major exposure for individuals. Targeted action plans have been introduced for each of these risks more than 10 years ago, and certain measures were further reinforced about five years ago:\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide delivers products to its customers and patients by road in 78 countries. The Group has a structured program to mitigate these risks on the road; the main measures include:\n- - equipping vehicles with technologies to assist drivers, to warn them in the event of danger or to protect them in the event of an accident. This is a rapidly changing field and Air Liquide is committed to providing the best technologies possible to its own fleet of vehicles, as well as those of transport professionals working on its behalf. Around half of the vehicles are already equipped, and the aim is to reach 80% in the coming years,\n- - continuously assess and audit compliance by operations with internal requirements set out in the protocol that was updated in 2020. This protocol is related to both material and human factors (e.g. the recruitment and training of professional drivers).",

For example, the number of truck overturns (such as when driving too quickly on a bend) has decreased from more than 30 per year five years ago to less than ten since 2019, despite the number of trucks in the fleet now exceeding 10,000;\n\n- \u25a0 the safety of industrial processes can be difficult to assess as, although rare, incidents can lead to very serious consequences with multiple fatalities. In order to ensure that operations efficiently take this risk into account, Air Liquide has introduced specific measures, the purpose of which are to control the most serious risks relating to production processes. These specific action plans have been assigned the necessary resources (expertise and budgets) and follow a roadmap. Their progress is regularly monitored by the Group's Executive Management.\n\n## 3.3.2. Risks related to the security of individuals\n\nTo reduce travel-related risks, Air Liquide applies a series of measures aimed at protecting those traveling for the duration of their trip:\n\n- \u25a0 factsheets for the countries with one of the three highest levels of risk summarizing the main recommendations to be aware of before departure; these are regularly updated by the Security Department;\n- \u25a0 all travel reservations to a very high risk or high-risk country are subject to a validation process by an employee's managers, then by the Safety Officer of the geographic region in question, who may even prohibit the trip;\n- \u25a0 within each entity and group of entities, a head of security is responsible for updating the country factsheets and specific recommendations for the subsidiary's employees, expatriates and travelers;\n- \u25a0 the reservation tool, which monitors trips, informs the host entities of the arrival of Group employees, and provides, where necessary, updated information;\n- \u25a0 for the duration of their trip, travelers benefit from support from the global service provider who informs them of any local situations, answers any questions and can arrange for medical support (ranging from advice by telephone to medical evacuation by air).\n\nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, particular care and attention were paid to the Group employees, as well as to service providers acting on behalf of Air Liquide. A crisis unit, led by the Head of Human Resources, met on a weekly basis and has developed various protocols over the months aimed at all the Group entities. These included:\n\n- \u25a0 covid-19: Recommendations and Business Continuity Plan (March 2020);\n- \u25a0 the management of employees of a critical production entity who test positive for covid-19 (March 2020);\n- \u25a0 HR - What action to take if an employee tests positive for covid-19? (May 2020);\n- \u25a0 guidance for the transition phase and anticipation of a 'second wave' (June 2020);\n- \u25a0 the use of covid-19 tests (July 2020).\n\nFinally, to facilitate the purchase of personal protection masks, and of other products necessary for the entities' activities, several teams were tasked with defining needs and then ensuring their supply. This special purpose organization, with support from the Group's Procurement Department, ensured that since May 2020 all of the subsidiaries' needs were met.\n\nThe site protection policy helps protect the employees and service providers who work there, as well as the people living near the industrial facilities. This policy relies on a site assessment process, followed by the measurement of the difference between the current level of protection and the required standard and, finally, on the action plan required to reduce these differences. The fundamentals of our site protection policy include a watertight fence, a well-managed access process, an adapted security and surveillance system, and finally the means to intervene and respond in the event of an intrusion.\n\nAll information regarding the security of employees and sites, as well as the pandemic, can be found on the Security intranet site. This site can be viewed by all employees worldwide.",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\n## Scope 1\n\nAir Liquide accounts for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions. For large units, Scope 1 emissions correspond to the difference in carbon content between the natural gas consumed by these units and the carbon content of their products. Reporting takes into account a minimum of 95% of the Group's emissions. The methodology and reporting of unrecognized sources are subject to a continuous improvement process.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nScope 2 totals the indirect GHG emissions generated by the production of electricity and steam purchased outside the Group. These emissions are related to the production of electricity and steam in the various countries where it operates. The reporting takes into account a minimum of 95% of the Group's emissions.\n\n## Scope 3\n\nThe Group reports other indirect GHG emissions under Scope 3 (categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 13 of the GHG Protocol (a) ), which concern the Gas and Services businesses. The categories not reported represent emissions that are not applicable in Air Liquide's business model (8 and 14), or negligible (5, 12 and 15), or already reported in Scope 1 (9), or for which the methodology and reporting are in the process of being developed (10).\n\n## 4.1.2. Water management-related risks\n\nFor Air Liquide, the risks are related to its water consumption, in particular in areas of water stress.\n\nWater consumption is measured by subtracting water return from water withdrawal by the Group in the course of its business. The difference is due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the loss of water through evaporation in the cooling process of rotating machines, particularly for the production of air gases; and\n- \u25a0 its use as a raw material for products such as hydrogen.\n\nWith regard to the cooling of Air Separation Units, there are several types of cooling systems:\n\n- \u25a0 more than half of these units have semi-open systems, where part of the water evaporates during the cooling process;\n- \u25a0 around one-third of these units have open systems. Water runs through the plant for cooling purposes but all water extracted is returned . Water consumption is considered to be null in this case.\n\nBoth types of units require continuous back-up water. The cooling process has no material impact on the quality of the water returned;\n\n- \u25a0 finally, the other units have closed systems, which do not extract water from their surrounding environment. These consume no water after the initial filling.\n\n## 4.2. REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\n## 4.2.1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)- and water management-related risks\n\nAssessment processes are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 methodology guidelines, such as, for example, assessment charts to regularly review risks according to their probability of occurrence and their potential impact, are provided to operations by the Sustainable Development Department which oversees the analysis process. Environmental risks are therefore assessed locally by the clusters (groups of countries) under the responsibility of their General Managers;\n- \u25a0 a summary of each assessment is reviewed by the Risk Committee. It validates guidelines, analyses decision making and ensures follow-up measures are taken;\n- \u25a0 the Environment and Society Committee examines the Group's strategy and commitments in terms of sustainable development and its environmental and societal measures, and reports back to the Board of Directors. It meets at least three times a year, and holds a joint session with the Audit and Accounts Committee once a year.\n\n## 4.3. APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS TAKING ACTIONS FOR THE CLIMATE\n\nAir Liquide is convinced that climate change and energy transition must be\n\nabsolute priorities of business and social concerns. This is why,\n\nin implementing its \"Taking Action\" global approach, the Group has placed\n\nclimate at the heart of its strategy. Through its climate objectives\n\nand initiatives, Air Liquide is aligning itself with the Paris Agreements.\n\nIn 2018, the Group published its Climate Objectives for reducing its environmental footprint. These objectives break down into three elements: taking measures with regard to its A ssets, with its C ustomers and for the E cosystems (ACE). This global approach applies to all of the Group's activities. As it seeks to reconcile growth with care for the environment, Air Liquide is drawing upon its ability to innovate. This work is part of a global and ambitious approach that covers all of the Group's impacts: in the measures it takes to limit the environmental footprint of our assets, helping customers in the development of sustainable solutions and taking part in the emergence of a low-carbon society.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)-related risks\n\n## Environmental policies and procedures\n\nThe procedure relating to greenhouse gas emissions is being updated. It will include:\n\n- \u25a0 a reminder of regulatory requirements to which the Group is currently subject in terms of greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u25a0 the methodology for calculating scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 the review of investment decisions, taking into account environmental responsibility criteria, particularly concerning greenhouse gas emissions, as well as an analysis of the opportunities and risks related to climate transition. As an illustration, Air Liquide takes into account an internal carbon price of 50 euros per ton.\n\n## The Group's Climate Objectives\n\nAir Liquide is fully aware of the importance and urgent nature of climate-related subjects. The Group intends to play an active role in achieving the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, which defines a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nGLYPH<30>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<30>fiGLYPH<16>GLYPH<20>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<17>GLYPH<21>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<21>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<20>\n\nof our production units\n\nImprove\n\nGLYPH<141>\n\nGLYPH<23>GLYPH<22>GLYPH<21>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<11>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<144>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<157>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<129>\n\nGLYPH<141>\n\nGLYPH<23>GLYPH<22>GLYPH<21>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<11>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<143>\n\nGrow\n\nGLYPH<24>GLYPH<22>GLYPH<10>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<21>fiGLYPH<23>GLYPH<13>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<27>fiGLYPH<24>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<9>GLYPH<20>\n\nGLYPH<127>\n\nGLYPH<129>\n\nCreate a\n\nGLYPH<16>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<26>GLYPH<27>GLYPH<25>GLYPH<24>\n\nGLYPH<10>GLYPH<20>GLYPH<14>fiGLYPH<19>GLYPH<16>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<24>GLYPH<30>GLYPH<23>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<29>GLYPH<19>GLYPH<9>GLYPH<20>\n\n- (a)  The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (the organization responsible for developing international standards for calculating carbon footprint, also known as the GHG Protocol) is the most widely used international accounting framework for understanding, quantifying and managing greenhouse gas emissions.

To reach this objective, the Group has identified the following drivers:\n\nDriver 1: increasing its purchases of renewable electricity by nearly 70%.\n\nTo increase its purchases of renewable electricity from 6 TWh in 2015 to 10 TWh in 2025, Air Liquide has introduced a proactive approach to renewable electricity procurement through direct contracts with producers (called PPA - Power Purchase Agreements).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn July 2020, Air Liquide signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for the supply of renewable electricity to cover up to 15% of the current consumption of its activities in Spain.\n\nThis contract is the first PPA for renewable energy in Europe and illustrates Air Liquide's commitment to lower its carbon footprint.\n\n## Driver 2: improving the energy efficiency of its production units by 5%.\n\nThe Group aims to reduce the energy consumption by unit of volume of its plants by 5% by 2025 through:\n\n- \u25a0 innovation to improve the performance of the most recent existing production units;\n- \u25a0 investments to modernize production units;\n- \u25a0 the automation and centralization of its operations, in particular by optimizing the performances of its plants in terms of energy consumption (CO2 emissions avoided).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn July 2020, Air Liquide announced a 125 million euros investment to build the first world-scale Air Separation Unit (ASU) for oxygen production with an energy storage system that helps facilitate more renewable energy on the electricity grid due to its grid stabilizing capability. This highly efficient plant, with circa 10% less electricity consumption, will have a production capacity of 2,200 tons of oxygen per day, and will be built in Port of Moerdijk in the Netherlands.\n\nDriver 3: reducing the carbon footprint of its bulk products in liquid form and of its cylinder products in gas form by 10% through the optimization of both production and transportation and the efficiency of delivery rounds.\n\nCurrently, only 15% of air gases and hydrogen produced by Air Liquide are transported by road (the rest of the deliveries are carried out either by pipeline or the gases are produced by units directly installed at the customers' sites). Moreover, thanks to the success of the delivery optimization programs, the efficiency of industrial gases transportation continues to improve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn November 2020, Air Liquide deployed, at a global scale, its bulk gases supply chain digitalization program, IBO (Integrated Bulk Operations). Digital technology and the associated massive collection of data from production plants to the customers' sites enable the improvement of operational performance and in particular a reduction in the carbon footprint.\n\nPresent within each operating entity, Climate Champions are responsible for rolling out the Group's Climate Objectives. They are the point of contact of the Sustainable Development Department in the clusters (groups of countries). They develop a roadmap that must define all the operational measures required to achieve the objectives. Their role also includes identifying projects, monitoring key indicators, and reporting progress.\n\nAll of the climate roadmaps to 2025 for all regions were updated during 2020.\n\n## Customers (C)\n\nThe Group is committed with its customers to creating a more sustainable industry through low-carbon solutions. Air Liquide already offers technologies, which allows its customers to reduce their emissions of CO2 and pollutants. The Group is continuously innovating and is also developing new solutions, such as CO2 capture and recovery and the injection of hydrogen into the blast furnaces of its metal producer customers. To reach this objective, the Group has identified the following drivers:\n\n## Driver 1: rolling out low-carbon offerings and solutions.\n\nAir Liquide provides its customers with the possibility of outsourcing some of their processes in order to pool assets and thus reduce the amount of energy used by up to 20%. The Group is also developing offerings which will reduce transport-related emissions, in particular through small production units installed at customers' sites and new-generation cylinders, which are 40% lighter than those made of steel. To improve the energy efficiency of combustion in the steel and glass industries, Air Liquide provides oxy-combustion solutions. This process consists of enriching air with oxygen to reduce energy consumption.\n\n(a)  In kg CO2-equivalent/euro of operating income recurring before depreciation and amortization at the 2015 exchange rate and excluding IFRS16 for greenhouse gas emissions scopes 1 and 2 (see reconciliation in Chapter 1 appendix, page 57).",

This investment underlines Air Liquide's capacity to provide low carbon and high-purity hydrogen and oxygen differentiated solutions. Hydrogen will be partially produced from renewable energy sources, which will avoid the emission of an estimated 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.\n\nIn September 2020, Air Liquide announced a long-term supply agreement with Eastman Chemical Company to provide additional gaseous oxygen, nitrogen and syngas supporting Eastman's growth and production in Longview, Texas. The Group will build a new Partial Oxidation Unit (POX) on site, using the Company's patented Lurgi technology, which will capture and recycle CO2, reducing the carbon intensity of operations.\n\n## Driver 2: co-developing innovative procedures with its customers.\n\nAir Liquide is working in partnership with its customers to introduce new solutions that will reduce the environmental footprint in various business areas:\n\n- \u25a0 either by reducing, where possible, the CO2 emissions of its customers by offering innovative solutions;\n- \u25a0 or by capturing CO2 to give it a second life (CCUS (a) - Industrial Merchant and Large Industries businesses) or by storing it permanently (CCS (b) - storage in old offshore natural gas reserves, for example).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn January 2020, Air Liquide renewed its partnership with Solidia Technologies, a developer of solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of precast concrete manufacturing. The innovative solutions industrialized by Air Liquide and Solidia experts during the pilot phase initiated in 2016 enable the production of concrete with an up to 70% reduced carbon footprint compared to traditional concrete.\n\n## Ecosystems (E)\n\nWith ecosystems, via an active dialog with a set of players (public authorities, industrial partners, NGOs, etc.), Air Liquide is contributing to the development of a low-carbon society, notably by developing biomethane for industry and transport and promoting hydrogen which, in both terms of mobility and energy, will play a key role in the energy transition and fight against climate change. To reach this objective, the Group has identified the following drivers:\n\n## Driver 1: expanding the circular economy.\n\nFor road freight transport, the use of biomethane reduces particulate matter emissions by 85%, CO2 emissions by 90% and noise emissions by 50% compared with diesel. The use of biomethane is growing and diversifying into the industrial and transport sectors by using new efficient and environmentally friendly applications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide launches biomethane activity in Italy with two new production units. Air Liquide has announced the construction of its first two biomethane production units in collaboration with its local partner Dentro il Sole (DIS). These two units will be built in Truccazzano (Milan) and Fontanella (Bergamo) in Italy, recycling organic material from agricultural and livestock activities to convert it into biomethane, a renewable energy source.\n\nOne of the leading retailers in the United Kingdom, ASDA, has contracted Air Liquide to install and operate six biomethane (BioNGV) distribution stations to refuel trucks on its sites. British retail group ASDA will commission more than 300 new Bio-NGV (Natural Gas for Vehicles) trucks in 2021 to reduce the environmental footprint of its transport activities.\n\n## Driver 2: using cryogenic expertise for clean mobility solutions.\n\nThis driver presents all the solutions using Air Liquide's expertise in the field of low temperatures, whether for clean refrigerated transport or those that enable the transport sector to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide developed Turbo-Brayton cryogenic equipment to reliquefy the evaporation of natural gas from LNG carriers and reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the maritime industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The success of this technology underlines the Group's ability to offer solutions, which reduce the environmental impact of its customers' activities. In fact, the sale of approximately sixty Turbo-Brayton cryogenic units in the last three years allows to avoid more than 290,000 tons of CO2-equivalent.\n\n(b)  CCS: Carbon Capture and Storage.",

This is one of the largest projects in Europe for the development of hydrogen trucks and related infrastructure and will contribute to reducing CO2 emissions by an estimated amount of more than 100,000 tons per year.\n\n## Driver 4: creating a global hydrogen economy.\n\nAir Liquide is a key driver in the creation of a global hydrogen economy. The Group was one of the founders of the Hydrogen Council, an initiative bringing together more than 100 global industry leaders to share their vision and ambition for hydrogen as an accelerator of the energy transition and to achieve climate change objectives. Hydrogen can decarbonize end uses such as transport, energy for industry or heating and electricity in the residential sector. Hydrogen can also play a major role in the storage of surplus energy in markets dominated by renewables. To foster the development of these initiatives, the French government announced in 2020 that it would commit more than 7 billion euros to hydrogen by 2030. In Germany, funds dedicated to hydrogen total 9 billion euros.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide is a founding member of the Hydrogen Council. The Hydrogen Council is the first global initiative of its kind and intends to show that hydrogen is a key solution in energy transition. Its purpose is to present and promote solutions to key decision makers in the global political, economic and financial ecosystem.\n\n## 4.3.2. Water management-related risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water management policy\n\nTo minimize the risks relating to water management with respect to third parties, a water policy is currently being drafted. The aim of this policy is to introduce best practices, share a common methodology for the calculation of indicators and measure the impact the water usage at Air Liquide sites may have on the population. This policy will be published in the BlueBook (a) in 2021.\n\n## Organizational structure and reporting tool\n\nAir Liquide has a network of water experts across all regions. Their role is to verify data and to be the dedicated contact point for all questions relating to water and its use.\n\nTo improve the gathering of information and better steer water management at its production sites, Air Liquide set up a working group several years ago to optimize the water consumption of operations, in particular in areas of water stress. Finally, it is currently working on a new reporting tool to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of data. The tool is set to be rolled out in 2021 and will be monitored as part of the Vigilance Plan.\n\n## 4.3.3. Employee commitment\n\n## Dedicated internal structure\n\nIn support of the climate approach, a specific structure has been implemented to replicate and promote best practices in terms of sustainable development within the Group. The actions of Climate Ambassadors, who are voluntary employees, cover subjects such as recycling, zero waste campaigns and sustainable mobility. They are tasked with sharing their experience and raising awareness of these subjects among employees in the workplace. The Group had 250 Climate Ambassadors at the end of 2020.\n\nThese actions are also shared on a dedicated Intranet site where more general information regarding the climate and the Group's strategy in this field can also be found: Climate Objectives, educational videos, articles, projects underway, local initiatives, etc.",

The Group returned two thirds of this water and the Group's actual consumption was 90 million m 3 .\n\n## Units in areas of water stress\n\nAir Liquide carried out a risk assessment on the water management risks of its sites following the publication in August 2019 of the new 'Aqueduc 3.0 Water Risk Atlas' map from the World Resource Institute (WRI). This assessment takes into account the specific data for each site according to its location in terms of a watershed, groundwater and an administrative boundary.\n\nTo carry out this assessment, the Group used the 'business as usual' scenario (SSP2 RCP8.5 of the GIEC). Each site is thus identified as belonging to an area of water stress or not (area defined according to the intensity of water conflict). This mapping also includes new units.\n\nBased on the mapping of Group units, 1% of facilities are located in regions that the World Resource Institute will consider to be arid zones in 2030.\n\n## 4.4.3.

The Group's largest procurement categories are energy, equipment and technical services.\n\nTwo levels of the organization are involved in procurement activities in the Air Liquide Group. The Group Procurement Department and the corresponding functions in the regional hubs are responsible for the main procurement categories, with the exception of energy purchases. The latter are managed by departments specialized in energy management. The Group Procurement Department drew up a sustainable procurement procedure in 2012, and amends it regularly to take into account any regulatory changes and the Group's ambitions (a) .\n\n## 5.1. RISK MAPPING\n\n## 5.1.1. Methodology\n\nThe risk mapping of human rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of individuals, and the environment for Air Liquide Group suppliers is based on the suppliers most exposed to these risks being identified. For this purpose, four main criteria are used:\n\n- 1\u00b0  the risk relating to the nature of the supplier's activity;\n- 2\u00b0  the risk relating to the country in which the supplier carries out its main activity;\n- 3\u00b0  Air Liquide current Spend with the supplier; and\n- 4\u00b0  the supplier's dependency to Air Liquide.\n\nThe nature of a supplier's activity depends on its allocation to one of 17 procurement categories, which are subdivided into 429 procurement sub-categories. For a more precise methodology, each procurement sub-category is allocated a global sustainability risk level, which includes in particular the environment, human rights and\n\nworking conditions, on a six-level scale (severe, medium high, high, medium low, low, very low).\n\nThe risk related to the country in which the supplier carries out its activity is assessed based on a weight of recognized public indicators for the environment (e.g. Environmental Performance Index, EPI), the health and social context (e.g. Human Development Index, HDI) and for human rights (e.g. Global Slavery Index, ITUC Global Rights Index), on a three-level scale (high risk, risk, no risk).\n\nThe combination of the four selected criteria leads to the identification of the most exposed suppliers ('Sustainability-Critical Suppliers'), who are prioritized in the implementation of assessment and prevention measures. In addition to those common criteria, the procurement functions in the geographies are free to define more stringent conditions, based on local specifities, to identify other Sustainability-Critical Suppliers.\n\n| Assessment criteria              | Assessment criteria      | Assessment criteria   | Assessment criteria                                  |                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1\u00b0 Nature of activity            | 2\u00b0 Country   of location | 3\u00b0 Annual   Spend     | 4\u00b0 Dependency                                        | Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers                                                |\n| Severe                           | All                      |                       | Regardless of                                        | According to the                                                                  |\n| High and medium high             | High risk   and risk     |                       | the supplier  dependency ratio if supplier           | According to the                                                                  |\n| High and medium high             | No risk                  | > \u20ac200 K              | dependency ratio                                     | According to the                                                                  |\n| Medium low, low and very low All | All All                  | < \u20ac200 K              | > 25% Regardless   of the supplier  dependency ratio | assessment of the local  procurement functions  based on more  stringent criteria |\n\n## 5.1.2. 2020 results\n\nThe mapping of supplier-related risks is updated on an annual basis by a working group made up of employees in charge of sustainable procurement at Group level, buyers who are specialized by category, and external consultants.\n\nIn 2020 and during the previous years, based on the methodology described above, 968 suppliers were identified as being the most exposed to an overall Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) risk.",

REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\nThe evaluation of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers is mainly carried out based on two kinds of questionnaires:\n\n- \u25a0 via an external platform specialized in the assessment of CSR performance; or\n- \u25a0 an internal questionnaire established by Air Liquide.\n\nAnswers provided in the questionnaires and supporting documentation produced by the suppliers are assessed by the experts from the external platform or by Air Liquide buyers, on a scale of 100 points. The score obtained reflects the supplier's global CSR performance:\n\n- \u25a0 suppliers which score less than 25/100 are considered as non-compliant. These suppliers are reassessed the following year following the implementation of a corrective action plan;\n- \u25a0 suppliers which score between 25/100 and 44/100 are considered as 'needing improvement'. These suppliers are requested to implement a corrective action plan within three years from their first assessment;\n- \u25a0 suppliers which score more than 44/100 are considered as compliant with Air Liquide's responsible procurement procedure.\n\nAir Liquide uses an external platform (in 2020, EcoVadis) which deploys an online questionnaire based on the ISO 26000 standard\n\nto assess the commitment of suppliers in terms of CSR. The main themes covered in this questionnaire include the environment, ethics, human rights and working conditions, and the sustainable procurement procedures introduced by suppliers. Suppliers rated compliant during their assessment, but which score less than 20/100 for one of the four themes must implement a corrective action plan.\n\nSince 2019, Air Liquide has developed an internal questionnaire to complement the solution offered by the external platform. This questionnaire is sent to Sustainability-Critical Suppliers selected for the assessment campaign that have refused to reply to the questionnaire sent by the external platform.\n\nIn 2020, the assessment campaign covered one-third of SustainabilityCritical Suppliers. 167 suppliers were assessed by the external platform and 69 by Air Liquide (internal method), with an average score of 45/100. To date, 773 Sustainability-Critical Suppliers were assessed at least once on their CSR performance, representing 80% of them.\n\nThe Sustainability-Critical Suppliers' evaluation procedures provide for a CSR audit, performed by an independent third party, of suppliers which are non-compliant twice in a row. Since 2016, such a situation has not been encountered.\n\n## 5.3. APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n## 5.3.1. Procedures\n\nIn order to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts relating to the duty of vigilance, Air Liquide applies all elements of the sustainable procurement procedure (which was updated in 2019), including in particular the following prevention measures:\n\n- \u25a0 the Procurement Code of Conduct, which is available in 14 languages, applies to all Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n- \u25a0 the Supplier's Code of Conduct, which is available in 14 languages, aims to promote and ensure compliance by all suppliers of practices relating to human rights, the protection of the environment and safety. This code is publicly available on the Air Liquide website (https://www.airliquide.com/group/sustainable-procurement);\n- \u25a0 a CSR commitment clause (covering compliance with the Supplier's Code of Conduct, safety, and the environment) is included in the contract templates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Corrective action plans\n\nFollowing the assessment of a Sustainability-Critical Suppliers, it is asked to implement a corrective action plan in the following cases:\n\n|                                       | Overall supplier score   | Overall supplier score   | Overall supplier score   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Assessment   of a Sustainability-     | >44                      | between   25 and 44      | <25                      |\n| Critical Suppliers (score out of 100) |                          |                          |                          |\n\n- (a) The environment, ethics, human rights and working conditions, and the sustainable procurement procedures introduced by suppliers.\n- Reassessment of the supplier every three or five years according to the duration and specific characteristics of the contract.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Reassessment of the supplier every three years and regular monitoring of its corrective action plan (to be implemented within three years from their first assessment).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- One month to set up a corrective action plan to be implemented in the following 12 months.\n- Reassessment the following year. A review is carried out each quarter by the procurement steering Committee.\n\nA dedicated sustainable procurement function, within the Procurement Department, coordinates the implementation of corrective action plans through a network of responsible procurement correspondents present in each regional hub.\n\n## 5.3.3. Training\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide organized training sessions in English, Chinese, French and Russian to raise awareness among buyers and suppliers of the Group's Sustainable Procurement approach and thus strengthen its roll out throughout the organization. Training courses are organized by subject and by region. Some training courses cover, in particular, the commitments of new suppliers, the implementation of corrective action plans, the internal assessment questionnaire, as well as socially inclusive procurement. For buyers, these training modules also present the consistency between Sustainable Procurement and Group strategy, explain the challenges of the Sustainable Procurement approach and position it as a source of value creation. A total of 170 buyers and 160 suppliers were trained in 2020.\n\n## 5.3.4. The Observatory for Sustainable Procurement\n\nAir Liquide also takes part in collaborative and multi-sector initiatives for sustainable procurement, in particular as a member of ObsAR (the French Observatory for Sustainable Procurement, https://www. obsar.asso.fr/). In 2018, this not-for-profit organization created a working group focused on the challenges presented by the Law on the Duty of Vigilance for procurement functions. Following two years of work, to which Air Liquide contributed, ObsAR published a White Paper entitled 'Implementing adapted measures to manage the Duty of Vigilance for suppliers and subcontractors', including best practices, methods and tools.\n\n## 5.4. MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe implementation of the sustainable procurement procedure, and in particular the results of Sustainability-Critical Supplier evaluations, is monitored by the Procurement Department. A steering committee, composed of the Group's sustainable procurement function and each of its regional correspondents, meets once a quarter to review the progress made in terms of objectives set by the Group.\n\n| 2020 Objectives                                                                                             |     | 2020 Results   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|----------------|\n| Driver 1:  Sustainability-Critical Suppliers rate of response to the annual assessment campaign             | 65% | 75%            |\n| Driver 2:  action plans prepared by suppliers where improvements were needed   (annual assessment campaign) | 62% | 75%            |\n| Driver 3:  action plans prepared and implemented by non-compliant suppliers                                 | 90% | 100%           |\n\nFollowing the assessment results and a review of corrective action plans, Air Liquide suspended, or significantly reduced, its sales relationship with 14 suppliers during 2020.\n\nThese performance indicators and their progress report were presented in April and October 2020 during the Group Procurement Board meetings, which bring together the Group Procurement Department and that of each region.",

COMPILATION OF REPORTS\n\nSince 2015, the Group has had an alert mechanism across all of its entities (EthiCall for all Group companies excluding Airgas, EthicsPoint for Airgas and its subsidiaries) which allows all employees and external service providers to anonymously file an alert with an independent external service provider.\n\nThis alert may cover:\n\n- \u25a0 behavior or a situation that is contrary to the Group's commitments in terms of health and safety;\n- \u25a0 a serious violation of human rights;\n- \u25a0 behavior or a situation that is contrary to the Group's commitments in terms of the environment;\n- \u25a0 deviations from the Code of Conduct of the employee's entity.\n\nThanks to regular communication (posters, intranet, reminders during e-learning courses, management communication), all employees are aware of the alert mechanism and can easily file an alert in their own language either by telephone or on the service provider's dedicated website.\n\nThe Group guarantees that any employee who reports an event in good faith will not be sanctioned or that any retaliatory measures will not be taken. This is also reiterated in the Code of Conduct.\n\nAll alerts are processed in a confidential manner and within a reasonable period, generally less than two months. Alerts are processed by internal teams according to their nature and their geographic origin. Employees responsible for processing the alerts may call upon external resources where required. A review of the most serious cases is carried out by an Ethics Committee at the hub or world business unit in question, or by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nThis system is an additional solution to the usual process for reporting incidents within the entities (managers, Human Resources Department, Legal Department, etc.). This allows alerts received to be processed rapidly and in a structured manner, thus minimizing their potential impact on individuals and the Group's organization.\n\nThe Group is currently reviewing the possibility of extending access to the alert mechanism to third parties during the second half of 2021.\n\nThe reporting process for the most serious safety and security accidents ensures that the relevant management and heads of safety and security within the subsidiary, cluster (group of countries), hub and Group (according to the level of severity) are rapidly informed of these incidents. A crisis management and incident monitoring process is therefore implemented to ensure the best care of any victims, secure the situation and establish an investigation team which is both qualified and adapted to the incident.\n\n## 6.2. MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe alert mechanism is supervised by the Group Ethics Officer who ensures the conformity of its operation, in particular the appropriate Group-wide communication regarding its use, the correct processing of alerts, and the protection of whistleblowers. The Group Ethics Officer reports back to the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee regarding the main indicators and information from this system.\n\nIn 2020, 279 alerts were reported in the alert mechanism, and in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 discrimination and psychological harassment: 154 cases;\n- \u25a0 health, safety, and environmental violations: 44 cases.\n\n29% of alerts were found to be justified following an investigation and led to sanctions and corrective measures.\n\nAn internal audit of the alert mechanism was carried out at the end of 2018 and found the processes in place to be adequate. The opportunities for improvement that were identified, notably the standardization of processing methods, were implemented.",

        "page_content": "Composition, preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors\n\n## COMPOSITION, PREPARATION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the Board of Directors comprises thirteen members: eleven members appointed by the General Meeting, including six foreign members (German, American, British, and Singaporean) and six women (representing 55%), and two Directors representing the employees. The term of office is for four years. The Board aims to stagger the renewals of the terms of office.\n\nIn May 2021, at the close of the General Meeting, following the expiry of the terms of office of two Directors and subject to the approval of the proposed resolutions, the Board of Directors will comprise fifteen members: thirteen members appointed by the General Meeting, including seven foreign nationals and six women (i.e. 46%) and two Directors representing employees.\n\n## 1. Code of Corporate Governance\n\nThe Board of Directors confirmed that, in keeping with the Group's previous practices, the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies is the Code to which the Company voluntarily refers. This Code in its updated version, is available on the website https://afep.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Afep\\_Medef-Coderevision-2020-EN-.pdf.\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee and the Remuneration Committee reviewed current practices in the Company with respect to the AFEP/MEDEF Code as amended in January 2020. Pursuant to article L. 22-10-10, 4\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code, those provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code that are currently not applied and the reasons for this are stated in this Report. A summary is presented in table format on page 142.\n\nThe AMF Report on Corporate Governance and the remuneration of Executive Officers of listed companies, together with the Report of the Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise (French High Committee on Corporate Governance) of November 2020 have been reviewed.\n\nThe principles governing the professional ethics of Directors, the diversity policy which applies to the Board of Directors, as well as the composition, role and rules of operation of the Board and its Committees are defined in the internal regulations. The updated version of these internal regulations, approved by the Board of Directors on May 5, 2020, which include in particular the new recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code as amended in January 2020, the changes required by the French PACTE Law, the amendments to the articles of association decided by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, and an update in line with the Group's practices, are published in their entirety on the Company's website.\n\n## 2. Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'The members are chosen for their skills, their integrity, their independence of mind and their determination to take into account the interests of all shareholders.'\n\n'Diversity policy concerning the Board of Directors: the composition of the Board of Directors, with regard to its members appointed by the Annual General Meeting upon the proposal of the Board of Directors, shall reflect diversity and complementarity of experience, in particular international experience, nationalities, age, gender, cultures and expertise, including a significant number of executive managers or former executive managers; the Board of Directors shall look for persons possessing skills in the following areas: marketing, services, industry, finance, health, research and technology.'\n\nThe Board of Directors, which has thirteen members, reflects a diversity of profiles, experience and complementarity of skills, which is appropriate for the issues faced by Air Liquide. The Board of Directors considers that compliance with the diversity policy criteria listed above contributes to the quality of its debates.\n\nThe diversity policy which applies to the members of the Board is accompanied by guidelines, which are set forth in the internal regulations which, although not written in stone, also guide the composition of the Board, in particular in terms of the number of Directors appointed by the General Meeting (in principle between 10 and 12), the balance between (former) executive managers and external members, the duration of the terms of office (four years,\n\nprinciple of staggering renewals, the proportion of members appointed by the General Meeting in office for more than twelve years cannot exceed one-third), age or the proportion of members who qualify as independent, thus aiming to comply with the recommended principles in terms of good Corporate Governance practices.\n\nThe Board of Directors relies upon the work of the Appointments and Governance Committee in order to propose to the General Meeting, any new appointment or renewal of the offices of Director. The Appointments and Governance Committee, in liaison with an external consultant, carries out its search for new members on the basis of its evaluation of the needs and developments expressed by the Board of Directors and in consideration of the principles and the diversity policy defined above. Based on a list of candidates submitted by the external consultant, the Appointments and Governance Committee makes its initial selection. Once this first selection is made, the consultant schedules interviews with the potential candidates preselected by the Committee. After the interviews, the consultant draws up a list of candidates for review by the Committee and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who takes part in the recruitment process. Meetings with candidates are held with Committee members and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Finally, the Committee submits to the Board a recommendation to appoint one or several candidates. In 2020, the Committee continued its search for North-American profiles and for candidates with specific experience and skills, particularly in the Digital and Innovation sectors, as part of a search for profiles to complement those of current Board members. This work, which has been reported to the Board, forms part of the policy to continue to improve the diversity of profiles and the complementarity of experience, expertise and cultures on the Board of Directors.",

Moreover, an obligation to provide information on the terms of office held in other companies, including their participation on the Board Committees of such companies, is provided for non-executive Directors. In this connection, the Board was informed of the appointment of Brian Gilvary as Executive Chairman of Ineos Energy (company 'under creation'). Moreover, an obligation to ask for the opinion of the Board of Directors (which makes a decision on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee) before accepting a new corporate office in a listed company is also provided for the Company's Executive Officers.\n\n## 3. Independence of Board members\n\nBased on the full definition of independence set out in the AFEP/ MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance, the internal regulations define the criteria applied within the Company to assess the independence of Board members.\n\n'A member of the Board of Directors is independent when he/ she has no relationship of any kind with the Company, its Group or its management which may interfere with his/her freedom to exercise his/her judgment.\n\nIn this spirit, the criteria which may provide guidance to the Board in order to classify a member as independent will be as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 he/she is not and has never been an employee or member of the Executive Management of the Company;\n- \u25a0 he/she does not hold office as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman or member of the Management Board of a company in which the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Executive Vice President of Air Liquide is a Director or member of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u25a0 he/she must not have any business relations with the Air Liquide Group which represent a significant part of the business activities (i) of the Company of which the Director is a member of the Executive Management or (ii) of Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 he/she does not have any close family links with the Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Executive Vice President;\n- \u25a0 he/she must not have been an auditor of the Company during the previous five years;\n- \u25a0 he/she must not have been a member of the Board of Directors (or Supervisory Board) of the Company for more than 12 years.'\n\nAn assessment of the independence of its members appointed by the General Meeting is included on the agenda for a Board meeting once a year. In reliance on the work of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors reviews each of the criteria contained\n\nin the Board's internal regulations and in the AFEP/MEDEF Code for assessing the independence of each Director.\n\nFor the criteria relating to business relations, the Board relies upon a chart summarizing the purchases and sales implemented during the previous fiscal year between companies of the Air Liquide Group and companies of groups within which an Air Liquide Director appointed by the General Meeting (or proposed Director) also exercises a term of office or executive role. Such figures are weighed against the total purchases and sales of each group to measure their significance. In addition to the aforementioned quantitative criteria, the Board of Directors carries out a qualitative review of the situation of each Director holding a term of office or executive role at the group in question.\n\nFor the 2020 fiscal year, this chart shows that the amounts of sales by the Air Liquide Group to any of the relevant groups or of its purchases from any of such groups do not exceed 0.4% of the total sales or purchases by the Air Liquide Group or by any of the relevant groups.\n\nFrom a qualitative point of view, it was also noted that neither Air Liquide nor the relevant groups have a relationship of economic dependence or exclusivity, as they are large international groups with highly diversified activities. It was asserted that, in light of the highly decentralized organization of the Air Liquide Group, its size, the diversity of its businesses, which are, for the most part, extremely local, and its broad geographical presence, the relevant Directors do not become involved in business relations which are conducted, within the Air Liquide Group, entirely by the managers of the relevant hubs, Clusters (groups of countries/entities) and countries.\n\nAfter a review of each individual situation, the Board concluded that none of the Directors has to exercise a direct or indirect decision-making power in the contractual negotiations leading to the business affairs discussed. If this were not the case, he/she would have to declare a conflict of interest to the Board. This matter would then be addressed in accordance with the ethical rules provided for in the internal regulations.",

The criteria used are very largely inspired by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance. The Board continues to consider, however, that the Company's former employees or officers cannot be deemed to be independent even if they ceased to hold office more than five years ago.\n\nFurther to the recommendation made by the AMF, a table showing the list of Directors in 2020 who are considered to be independent in light of the criteria provided for in the internal regulations, as compared with the AFEP/MEDEF Code, is set out below.\n\n|                                                       | As at December 31, 2020 Independence of the Directors elected by the General Meeting   in light

Pursuant to the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, Philippe Dubrulle and Fatima Tighlaline, Directors representing the employees, were not taken into account when calculating this ratio.\n\nGiven the new composition of the Board of Directors following the Combined General Meeting of May 4, 2021, subject to the approval\n\nof the proposed resolutions, the percentage of independent Directors on the Board of Directors would be 92% . In view of the appointment of three new Directors, Pierre Breber, Aiman Ezzat and Bertrand Dumazy , proposed to the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, the Board of Directors examined the individual situation of each candidate with regard to the criteria of the Board of Directors' internal regulations and of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. Following this assessment, the Board stated that Pierre Breber, Aiman Ezzat and Bertrand Dumazy are considered independent.\n\n## 4. Professional ethics of Directors Rights and obligations of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations summarize the main obligations imposed on Directors.

They have no conflict of interest\n\n(even if it is only potential) with regard to L'Air Liquide  S.A. No arrangement or agreement has been entered into with the principal shareholders, customers, suppliers or other persons, pursuant to which Air Liquide S.A.'s corporate officers were selected as such. Such persons have not agreed any restriction on the transfer, within a certain period of time, of their holding in the capital of L'Air Liquide S.A. apart from the rules relating to the prevention of market abuse, the statutory obligation for the members of the Board of Directors who are elected by the General Meeting to hold at least 500 registered shares in the Company throughout the period of their term of office and the shareholding obligations which apply to the Executive Officers. The corporate officers have not been linked to any bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation at any point during the last five years.\n\nFinally, the Appointments and Governance Committee, under the management of the Lead Director, currently has the task of preventing potential situations of conflict of interest on the Board.\n\nAs every year, an internal memo on the prevention of market abuse was sent to the Directors (at the beginning of 2021), which outlines in greater detail the applicable legal and regulatory obligations by which they are bound pursuant to the European and national provisions.\n\nAll the provisions governing Directors' rights and obligations are included in the manual for members of the Board of Directors which is updated every year.\n\n## 5. Combination of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Board of Directors decided to maintain the combination of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, both roles being held by Beno\u00eet Potier, at the close of the General Meeting on May 16, 2018 which decided upon the renewal of his term of office as Director. Within the scope of the full evaluation questionnaire concerning the way in which the Board operates, which was prepared at the end of 2019, and in the simplified questionnaire prepared at the end of 2020, the Directors confirmed their agreement with this Executive Management organization.\n\nThis mode of Executive Management of the Company allows for regular, personalized exchanges between the shareholders and the Executive Management through a single contact person, who has an in-depth knowledge of the Group and its businesses and makes it possible to ensure that the definition of the Group's strategy takes due account of shareholders' expectations and interests over the long term. Maintaining the combination of roles therefore promotes a close, trusting relationship between the Executive Officer and the shareholders. This organization is in keeping with the very specific shareholding structure of Air Liquide which has always consisted, alongside institutional investors from all continents, of a significant number of individual shareholders (who hold 33% of the capital at the end of 2020), accompanying the Group over the long term.\n\nIn this regard, the Company regularly organizes, in particular through its Shareholder Service, meetings between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the individual shareholders. Accordingly, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer chairs the Shareholders' Communication Committee, which met three times in 2020, two of which were by video-conference in the context of the public health crisis.\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer also regularly meets the institutional shareholders, through the intermediary of the Investor Relations Service, either individually or at group meetings which are organized several times a year. These are essentially question and answer sessions. Accordingly, in 2020, Beno\u00eet Potier met several dozens of institutional investors at meetings in person in February, before the restriction measures due to the public health crisis were imposed, and in remote meetings for the rest of the year. He also had discussions with financial analysts during two question and answer sessions.\n\nA procedure is in place which enables the Board of Directors to be informed of contacts made between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the principal shareholders.\n\nThe combination of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer complies with the balanced governance rules, ensuring the continued success of the Group and the loyalty of its shareholders. The principal applicable governance rules are described below:\n\n- \u25a0 the presence of an independent Lead Director, Jean-Paul Agon, who has specific powers, including the power to ask the Chairman to convene the Board of Directors on a given agenda, the Chairman being bound by that request. The Lead Director may be asked by the other Directors for individual meetings, whenever they consider necessary and the Directors are regularly questioned on their level of dialogue with the Lead Director. In order to further enrich the dialogue with the principal shareholders, the latter have the right, at their request, to meet with the Lead Director (two meetings thus took place in 2020);",

The articles of association grant a power to one-third of the Directors to convene a Board meeting and determine its agenda, if a Board meeting has not been convened for over two months. In addition, the Directors have the possibility of setting up working groups within the Board in the event of a significant acquisition. Every year, the Board holds an executive session, chaired by the Lead Director, without the presence of the Executive Officers and former Executive Officers or of any person internal to the Group;\n- \u25a0 the existence of specialist Committees on appointments and governance, remuneration, audit and environment and society. A monitoring task was entrusted to the Appointments and Governance Committee which is responsible for supervising the proper working of the governance bodies. In this regard, pursuant to the internal regulations, the Committee is the organ of dialogue between the non-executive Directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in particular in the event of conflicts within the Board; it monitors the changes in the Corporate Governance practices and the process for evaluating the Board.\n\nSince 2014, as part of the annual evaluation questionnaires, the Directors are systematically questioned on the mode of exercise of the Executive Management (combination of roles) and on the actual participation of the members of the Board.\n\nEach year, the Appointments and Governance Committee considers the procedure for the replacement of the Executive Management in the event of an emergency situation.\n\nIn connection with the interactions between the Board of Directors, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the management teams, the relations between the Board of Directors, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee are linked as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 a balanced organization:\n- - limits on the powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Board's agreement being required for significant transactions,\n- - regular interactions between the non-executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee at the time of specific presentations made to the Board, in particular during the full-day session on strategy or during Committee meetings. The Directors may ask to meet members of the Executive Committee at any time,\n- -  regular information being provided to the Directors, including in-between Board meetings;\n- \u25a0 an annual review of the assessment of performance and remuneration of the Executive Officers by the Committee which is always carried out without the presence of the relevant Executive Officer;\n- \u25a0 the Executive Committee, which now comprises 14 members, ensures the coordination between the various Group programs and activities. The Executive Committee focuses principally on the review of Group's strategy, operational management in terms of objectives, state of progress and action plans, the conduct of projects for change, human resources strategy and development. The four Executive Vice-Presidents form part of the Executive Committee.",

Lead Director\n\nPursuant to the terms of article 13 of the articles of association, the Board of Directors is obliged to appoint a Lead Director, as long as the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are combined.\n\nWithin this framework, on May 3, 2017 and on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors appointed Jean-Paul Agon, an independent Director, as Lead Director. Jean-Paul Agon's term of office as Director, having expired, was renewed by the General Meeting on May 16, 2018 for a\n\nperiod of four years. At the close of that General Meeting, the Board of Directors decided to renew Jean-Paul Agon's position as Lead Director for the period of his term of office on the Appointments and Governance Committee.\n\nThe meeting of the Board of Directors held on May 16, 2018, at the close of the General Meeting, also decided to renew Jean-Paul Agon's position as Chair of the Appointments and Governance Committee for the period of his term of office as Director.\n\nThe internal regulations of the Board of Directors:\n\nA)  define the responsibilities and powers of the Lead Director as follows:\n\n## 'Roles, responsibilities and powers of the Lead Director\n\nThe Lead Director has the following roles, responsibilities and powers:\n\n- 1. He conducts, upon delegation from the Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee when he is not the Committee Chairman himself, the work of the Appointments and Governance Committee concerning the governance tasks entrusted to the Committee, notably for the examination of the choice of general management organization, the review of changes in and application of the rules of Corporate Governance, the preparation of the evaluation of the functioning of the Board, the review of ethical issues, the attention paid to the proper functioning of the governance bodies, in particular in the transmission of the information requested by independent Directors; on all these points, the Lead Director can formulate all proposals and make any suggestions he considers necessary.\n- - More specifically, the Lead Director coordinates, within the Committee, the implementation of the procedures aimed at identifying and analyzing potential situations of conflicts of interest on the Board; he draws the attention of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to potential situations of conflicts of interest identified in this manner.\n- - He reports on these matters to the Board of Directors.\n- 2. The Lead Director, after receiving the opinion of the Appointments and Governance Committee, may ask the Chairman of the Board of Directors to convene a meeting of the Board of Directors on any specified agenda, at any time and as often as required in the interests of the Company.\n- - Under the conditions provided for in article IV of these regulations, the Lead Director may also receive a delegation of authority to convene a meeting of the Board of Directors at the request of at least one-third of its members.\n- 3. The Lead Director, after receiving the opinion of the Appointments and Governance Committee, may propose the inclusion of additional points on the agenda for any Board meeting to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n- 4. Once a year, the Lead Director calls a meeting of the members of the Board of Directors for a session to be held without the presence of the Group's executive Directors (or former executive Directors) or internal Directors and employee representatives. He organizes and leads the discussions of this annual session which he chairs.\n- 5. The Lead Director reviews the requests made by shareholders with regard to governance and makes sure that they are answered.\n- 6. The Lead Director reports on his activities to the Board of Directors every year.\n- 7. The Lead Director makes sure that a report is made to the shareholders on the governance issues falling within the scope of his responsibilities. A report on his activities is made in the Universal Registration Document.'\n- B)  provide that, within the scope of the annual evaluation of the Board, the Directors will be systematically asked to indicate whether it appears to them to be necessary for the Company's Executive Management organization to be reexamined;\n- C)  also provide, without prejudice to the provisions on convening the Board of Directors, which are set forth in the internal regulations of the Board of Directors, that the Lead Director, after receiving the opinion of the Appointments and Governance Committee, may ask the Chairman to convene the Board of Directors on a given agenda; this right may be exercised at any time and as often as the Company's interests may require. The Chairman is bound by such a request.\n\nIn addition, certain governance measures promote discussions between the Lead Director and the Directors and dialog between the Lead Director and the shareholders (see page 125).\n\nSee page 139 for the 2020 report on the exercise of the Lead Director's term of office.",

Role and tasks of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the orientations of the Company's activities and ensures their implementation, in accordance with its corporate interest, taking into account the social and environmental stakes of its activity. Accordingly, it examines and approves the Group's major strategic orientations. It ensures the implementation of these orientations by the Executive Management.\n\nThe Board of Directors regularly reviews, in connection with the strategy which it has defined, opportunities and the financial, legal, operational, social and environmental risks, together with the measures taken accordingly. It ensures that a system has been implemented for the prevention and detection of corruption and influence peddling.\n\nSubject to the powers attributed to the General Meetings and within the limit of the corporate purpose, the Board deals with any issue concerning the smooth running of the Company and manages corporate business pursuant to its decisions. The internal regulations stipulate that the specific powers vested in the Board of Directors include, in particular, the choice of Executive Officers, the determination of their remuneration and setting of the terms and conditions governing their employment and performance of their duties in accordance with current law and regulations; the appointment of the Lead Director; the convening of the General Meeting (and determination of the agenda and draft resolutions within this scope), the preparation of the financial statements and Annual Management Report (including the Extra-financial Performance Declaration) and the Corporate Governance report; the definition of the Group's gender policy in leaderships; establishing its proper rules for functioning (formation of Committees, breakdown of Directors' annual remuneration, and more). In addition, the Board of Directors may also decide or authorize simple bond issues.\n\n## 8. Limits on powers\n\nThe internal regulations specify the rules limiting the powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, by defining the thresholds above which certain key decisions require prior authorization by the Board of Directors, in accordance with article 13 of the articles of association:\n\n- \u25a0 sureties, endorsements and guarantees for an individual amount in excess of 100 million euros or for an annual aggregate amount in excess of 500 million euros;\n- \u25a0 external sales or contributions (to non-controlled companies) of equity investments or lines of business, certain mergers, demergers or partial business transfers, completed for an individual amount in excess of 250 million euros or an annual aggregate amount, for each of these categories of transactions, in excess of 400 million euros; external sales or contributions of real estate assets for an individual amount in excess of 80 million euros or an annual aggregate amount in excess of 150 million euros;\n- \u25a0 creation of pledges or security for an individual amount in excess of 80 million euros or an annual aggregate amount in excess of 150 million euros;\n\nThe Board also exercises the powers delegated to it by the General Meeting, particularly with regard to the granting of stock options or award of performance shares, issues of marketable securities, share buyback or employee savings programs.\n\nActing on a proposal by Executive Management, the Board sets the diversity targets for the Group's leaderships. Executive Management makes a submission to the Board on how the targets will be implemented, together with an action plan and schedule for completion. Executive Management reports its results to the Board every year.\n\nDiversity, including gender mix, is integral to the Air Liquide Group's strategy. The new AFEP-MEDEF Code provisions, amended in January 2020, according to which the Board determines the gender diversity targets within the Group's leaderships, on the proposal of Executive Management have been taken into account. On the Appointments and Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board meeting of February 2021 reviewed the achievement of the objectives set for 2020, all of which were met. It decided to maintain the ambitious objectives set for 2025. These items are contained in this Universal Registration Document, in Chapter 5, pages 301, 302 and 326.\n\nThe non-discrimination and diversity policy in leaderships, and particularly information relating to the manner in which the Company tries to obtain a balanced representation of women and men on the Executive Committee, and to the results concerning the gender mix with regard to the 10% of positions which carry the most responsibility is contained in this Universal Registration Document, at Chapter 5, pages 302 and 326.\n\n- \u25a0 commitments to invest, acquisitions which will be posted under 'fixed assets' on the balance sheet, or subscriptions to share capital increases, for an individual amount in excess of 250 million euros or an annual aggregate amount in excess of 400 million euros; the Board of Directors is informed, if possible ex ante and in any event ex post, of transactions for an individual amount in excess of the threshold of 250 million euros, (i) involving purchases of items that cannot be posted under 'fixed assets' on the balance sheet, such as electricity or natural gas purchases, and (ii) involving sales to third parties of goods or engineering or construction services;\n- \u25a0 financing operations concerning the Group for an amount which is likely to substantially alter the Group's financial structure;\n- \u25a0 operations which are likely to substantially alter the Group's strategy.\n\nFurthermore, the Board shall be given prior information in the event of a fundamental modification of the information system, leading to development costs in excess of 250 million euros.",

Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nInforming the Directors: the internal regulations define the methods for informing the Directors. They specify, in particular, that prior to Board meetings, a file of meeting documentation is sent out to Board members covering the items on the agenda. Files are provided in electronic form on a dedicated platform. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, assisted, if need be, by members of the management teams, presents to the Board of Directors a quarterly report on the Company's management, the draft annual and interim financial statements and the various issues requiring the Board's authorization or opinion. For major substantive issues (major projects, M&A...), a very detailed summary is prepared. Any member of the Board of Directors may request any additional information he/she considers necessary. He/ she makes such a request to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nConduct of meetings: the internal regulations define the frequency of meetings and the rules for convening meetings and for participation by videoconference or telecommunications. They provide, in particular, for the Lead Director's right to ask for a meeting of the Board of Directors to be convened with any specified agenda and also for the conditions of the executive session attended by the members of the Board of Directors without the presence of the Group's Executive Directors (or former Executive Directors) or internal Directors and employee representatives, chaired by the Lead Director. The Statutory Auditors are also heard during the meetings to review the financial statements.\n\nDuring the meeting, a summary presentation of the items is then made, allowing considerable time for exchanges and discussions. The presentations give rise to questions and are followed by discussions. A round-the-table discussion is systematically held concerning the significant points, before moving to vote on the items on the agenda. Detailed written minutes are then sent to the members for their review and comments, before the approval of the Board of Directors at its next meeting.\n\nFormation of Committees: the internal regulations define the task and operating procedures for the four Board Committees (a description of Committees' tasks is provided at pages 134, 137, 139 and 141).\n\nTraining measures: the internal regulations stipulate that training relating to the Company's businesses and specific features is offered to the Directors, in particular by means of site visits or meetings with senior executives and the Corporate Social Responsibility business challenge. More particularly, trainings on the Group's accounting, financial and operational specificities are offered to the members of the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nEach year, the Directors are asked about their training requirements and a training request form is systematically proposed once a year to each Director and to the new Directors. It consists of proposals for meetings with the heads of each of the major business lines and main central functions, and site visits.\n\nWithin this framework, the Directors may ask to meet Executive Committee members or ask for specific training for each business line, activity or geographical zone.\n\nAccordingly, in 2020, some Directors attended training courses/ information meetings organized in particular on (i) activities in the Europe zone, with the relevant Executive Committee member and (ii) the Electronics business, as part of site visits. In addition, following the appointment of the two new Directors by the General Meeting in May 2020, meetings were organized between the new Directors and the relevant Executive Committee members concerning, in particular, the topics of innovation, safety, the Climate Objectives, the Industrial Merchant business, finance and human resources.\n\nThe Directors representing the employees may receive training relating to their rights and obligations as Directors, in accordance with the applicable regulations. They benefit from the training time allocated for (i) the preparation of meetings (15 hours/meeting) and (ii) training (40 hours/year), under the PACTE Law. This time is considered as actual working time and remunerated as such.\n\nThe breakdown of the trainings carried out in 2020 by the two Directors representing the employees is stated on page 130 below.",

WITH A DELIBERATIVE VOTE\n\nAppointed as a Director representing the employees by the France Group committee in 2014, Philippe Dubrulle's office was renewed by the same Committee at its plenary session on December 6, 2017, for a term of four years which will expire at the close of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nPursuant to the applicable regulations at the time of his appointment, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors had defined the amount of time allocated to Philippe Dubrulle for (i) the preparation of meetings (15 hours/meeting) and (ii) training (20 hours/year or 80 hours on a cumulative basis over the entire length of his term of office). Within this framework, in 2016, Philippe Dubrulle had followed the training course provided by Sciences-Po in partnership with the IFA and obtained the company Director's certificate. As part of the renewal of his term of office in 2017, the Board of Directors defined a new training program. In 2020, Philippe Dubrulle attended meetings organized within the Group as part of site visits on the Electronics business and attended training on the sustainable business model, organized by Centrale Supelec\\_EXED, (for which the first training session had already been completed in November 2019).\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the PACTE Law and the Company's articles of association, a second Director representing the employees was appointed by the European Works Council: Fatima Tighlaline was appointed as a Director representing the employees on October 1, 2020 by the European works Council. She joined the Group in 2002 and moved to Procurement Department at Sant\u00e9 France in 2014 before taking over as Head of the Ile-de-France planning team in the Vitalaire subsidiary in March 2020.\n\nTraining courses were proposed to Fatima Tighlaline upon her appointment. Accordingly, in 2020, she took part in sessions organized with members of the Executive Committee on specific topics (notably Finance and Human Resources) and enrolled in the training provided by Sciences Po, in partnership with the IFA, to obtain the company Director's certificate.\n\nPhilippe Dubrulle and Fatima Tighlaline sit on the Board with a deliberative vote. They are subject to all of the provisions of the internal regulations governing the rights and obligations of the Directors mentioned above.\n\nWithin the scope of the agreement entered into with the various stakeholders and pursuant to the provisions in force within the Group, which apply to all the employees performing duties on Boards of\n\nDirectors of the Group companies, it was agreed that employee Directors would not receive any remuneration.\n\nPhilippe Dubrulle is also a member of the Board Committee which is in charge of reviewing the environmental and societal issues. He contributes in particular to this Committee, as part of the assignments which are entrusted to it concerning the definition and roll-out of the Group's actions on environmental and societal matters, the vision of Group employees, who are essential stakeholders. Philippe Dubrulle, who had made known his interest in issues relating to sustainable development, has sat on the Environment and Society Committee since it was formed, in May 2017.\n\n## 10.2. WITH AN ADVISORY VOTE\n\nTaking the appointment of a Director representing the employees into account, the number of Social and Economic Council delegates participating on the Board with an advisory vote, can be reduced to one. Since Philippe Dubrulle was appointed as a Director representing the employees in 2014, pursuant to the provisions of the agreement with the various stakeholders, two delegates from the Social and Economic Council - and not one as provided by law - continued to attend Board meetings with an advisory vote.\n\nThe agreement also provides that the Social and Economic Council delegates attending Board meetings with an advisory vote can be reduced to one if there are two Directors representing the employees.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of this agreement, following the appointment of the second employee Director in October 2020, the Social and Economic Council chose one of its two representatives to continue to represent it on the Board. As a result, one Council member designated by the Council continues to attend Board meetings with an advisory vote.\n\nThe delegate receives the same documents as those provided to the Directors for these meetings. The delegate is able to express his opinion on the questions discussed during the meetings.\n\nA preparatory meeting, in the presence of a member of the Executive Committee and the Secretary of the Board of Directors, is scheduled before each Board meeting. This preparatory meeting is the opportunity to go through the whole file for the Board meeting with the Directors representing the employees and the Social and Economic Council delegate and to comment on the items on the agenda. It offers the participants the opportunity to raise their questions and make their initial comments.",

        "page_content": "## Composition, preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors\n\n## 11. Appraisal of the Board of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'The Board will ensure that an evaluation is carried out periodically of its composition, its organization and its functioning as well as those of its Committees. An update will be made by the Board on this topic once a year and a formal evaluation will be carried out at least every three years. Within the scope of the evaluation of the Board, the Directors will, in particular, be asked to state whether it appears to them to be necessary for the choice of the Company's general management organization to be re-examined.'\n\nAn evaluation of the functioning of the Board of Directors is carried out every year, alternating, one year, between a full appraisal questionnaire leading to a summary showing the replies and the adoption of recommendations for action and, the next year, a questionnaire aimed at making an assessment of the actions implemented in light of the recommendations made.\n\nThe functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees was fully evaluated in 2019. In this regard, a full appraisal questionnaire was submitted to the Board members and individual interviews were held with the Board's Secretary.\n\nThe summary of responses to this full appraisal questionnaire presented by the Chair of the Appointments and Governance Committee to the Board meeting early in 2020 showed a very favorable overall perception of the functioning of the Board of Directors. The members highlighted, in particular, the quality of the discussions within the Board, the level of dialog and the contributions of the members. The feedback was also very positive on the executive session and on the new joint session between the Audit Committee and the Environment and Society Committee. Their answers showed that the members were keen to continue site visits and contacts with management. The focal points concerned in particular the pursuit of efforts to recruit American Directors, the continuation of the work of the Committee responsible for preparing the succession plan, and the pursuit of contacts with management.\n\nIn response to Directors' interest in recruiting American Directors, the Board of Directors, based on the work of the Appointments and Governance Committee, proposed the appointment of two new Directors, both women and one an American, Kim Ann Mink, to the Combined General Meeting on May 4, 2020. Efforts to recruit American Directors continued. Concerning the succession plan, the Appointments and Governance Committee has focused its work on preparing a succession plan for the Chairman and Chief\n\nExecutive Officer and an additional meeting was held on this subject in October 2020. As part of meetings with management, despite the pandemic which reduced the opportunity for meetings, a lunch with members of the Executive Committee took place when the Board met in July 2020. In addition, panels of discussions were held with some Executive Committee members and other senior executives during the Board meeting in September at the Paris-Saclay site and over lunch. Moreover, broadly speaking, specific subjects are always presented to the Board and the Committees by the relevant Executive Committee member for the issue.\n\nDuring the evaluation carried out in 2020, the Directors expressed their satisfaction with the actions carried out in 2020 following the remarks made in the full appraisal questionnaire for 2019. Members particularly appreciated the gradual increase of the weighting of US Directors on the Board, with the appointment of Kim Ann Mink by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, plus the proposed appointment of Pierre Breber at the General Meeting of May 4, 2021. They were also highly satisfied with the work of the Appointments and Governance Committee on the succession process, which was reported to the Board, contact between the Board and the members of the Executive Committee and management, which the members would like to see continued and increased, and the subjects studied by the Board in 2020, particularly hydrogen and the energy transition. As in previous years, all members appreciated the executive session . The training initiatives, especially for new members, that were held online due to the pandemic were considered very useful. The Directors expressed the hope that the Board's work would continue to intensify with regard to Climate issues and, more generally, the Sustainable Development strategy , both of which the members unanimously considered to be core subjects, with the support of the specialized Committees and the joint session between the Audit Committee and the Environment and Society Committee responsible for the in-depth examination of issues common to both Committees.\n\nIn light of the collegiate nature of the Board, the assessment questionnaire concentrates on the collective contribution of members to the Board operation. However, the questionnaire invites the Director to make an evaluation of the actual, individual contribution of Directors in the reflections of the Board of Directors. The contribution by each Director is assessed, furthermore, by the Appointments and Governance Committee and then by the Board of Directors at the time of renewal of the terms of office of Directors and Committee members.\n\nThe Board considers calling on periodically an external consultant within the scope of conducting these evaluations.\n\n## 12. Executive session of the non-executive members of the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code which recommend that at least one meeting per year is organized without the presence of the Executive Officers, the internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'Once a year, the Lead Director calls a meeting of the members of the Board of Directors for a session to be held without the presence of the Group's executive Directors (or former executive Directors) or internal Directors and employee representatives. He organizes and leads the discussions of this annual session which he chairs.'\n\nIn 2020, the executive session took place at the close of the November meeting of the Board of Directors. A report was provided to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.",

Written minutes of the meeting are transmitted to the Directors. The Committee may ask to convene Group employees. It may meet with the Statutory Auditors or members of the Group Internal Control Department in person. It may call on external experts for assistance. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not attend meetings of the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## The Audit and Accounts Committee's work in 2020\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee met five times with an effective attendance rate, or attendance rate by telephone, of 100% its members.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the annual and interim consolidated financial statements and the annual parent company financial statements; it took due note of the Company's financial situation, cash flow position and commitments. During the presentation by the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Committee more particularly analyzed provisions, 'Other operating income and expenses', cash flow, taxation, risk exposure, etc. It reviewed the draft presentations on the financial statements for analysts.\n\nIn addition, the Committee heard the presentations of the Statutory Auditors underlining the key points of the results and took note of their conclusions.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee reviewed the amount of fees paid to the Statutory Auditors in respect of the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe Committee took due note of the contents of the three draft reports issued by the Statutory Auditors, pursuant to European Regulation No. 537/2014. The reports on the statutory accounts and the consolidated statements include a description of the principal audit topics and are included in the Universal Registration Document while the third, more detailed report is intended for the Audit Committee only.\n\nThe Committee monitored the financial impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on its businesses and regions; the performance analysis with the efficiency programs and the exceptional cost reduction plan introduced in response to the public health crisis; the Group's financing policy, debt and liquidity management, and investment decisions. The Audit Committee was also informed of the non-audit services which were approved in 2020 within the scope of the approval procedure for the Group's non-audit services, which was validated by the Board. The Committee also started on the required work to replace one of L'Air Liquide S.A.'s joint Statutory Auditors in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, specific presentations were made to the Committee on the following points: (i) protecting digital assets and managing cyber crises, (ii) site and employee safety, (iii) managing procurement, a review of the procedures for approving major suppliers and internal control processes, (iv) acquisition management as part of due diligence and consolidation of acquisitions in accordance with recent regulations, (v) sustainable finance, (vi) current disputes, and (vii) tax risks. The Audit Committee also monitored compliance with regulations on ethics, prevention of corruption and influence-peddling (as part of the current procedures within the Group).\n\nThe Committee heard regular reports on the main assignments carried out by the Group Control Department, the follow-up of any corrective actions taken and the Group Control Department's main assignments for the forthcoming fiscal year. The Committee also regularly monitored the process for deployment of the risk management procedure within the Group. It reviewed the Group's risk map and the changes made to it. The Committee reviewed the information provided in the\n\nUniversal Registration Document concerning the internal control and risk management procedures and recommended its approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn accordance with longstanding practice in the Group, the Committee is tasked with monitoring the management of all the risks identified by the Group, even if particular attention is paid to accounting or financial risks; a methodology for the monitoring of each type of risks (including, in particular, the identification of the management and control bodies and procedures) and an appropriate time scale (annual review or regular review at less frequent intervals, depending on the type of risks) were defined. In 2020, the Committee ensured in particular that the specific risks relating to climate change were taken into account when preparing financial statements. At year-end, the Committee ensures that all of the risks identified on the risk map and subject to regular review have been examined by the Audit Committee according to the frequency specified. The work program prepared for the 2021 fiscal year is consistent with this approach. It was presented to the Board for discussion. The Committee discussed the topics that could be presented to the Board to improve the fit between the work of the Committee and that of the Board on this subject.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee also reviewed the implementation of the assessment procedure for ordinary agreements entered into on arm's length terms which has been implemented at the Group. It is noted that, pursuant to the PACTE law, this procedure provides a methodology for regularly assessing whether the agreements involving L'Air Liquide S.A. that are not qualified as regulated agreements meet these conditions. It also reminds the Group of the rules for classifying agreements entered into by L'Air Liquide S.A. as either regulated agreements or as ordinary agreements entered into on arm's length terms. At the beginning of 2020, this procedure was widely disseminated within the Group's internal teams for implementation in each division and department of L'Air Liquide S.A. Application of this procedure during the past fiscal year did not give rise to any reclassification of an ordinary agreement entered into on arm's length terms as a regulated agreement.\n\nSeveral days prior to each meeting, a file of meeting documentation, available in electronic form, is provided to Committee members on a dedicated platform. Each Committee meeting is preceded by a preparatory meeting attended by the Committee Chair, assisted by the Committee Secretary, the Group Chief Financial Officer and the Group Control Director. In order to prepare the meetings where financial statements are reviewed, the Committee Chair meets with the Statutory Auditors, without the presence of the Company representatives. During the meeting, each presentation made by the Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Control Director, the senior executive specializing in the area under discussion, or the Statutory Auditors during the financial statement review meetings is followed by discussion.\n\nAn oral report and then written minutes of each meeting are prepared for the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee Chair receives summaries of the internal audit reports. In addition, after presentation meetings for the accounts for the fiscal year, the Committee members can meet alone with the Statutory Auditors, without the presence of the Company representatives.\n\nAs recommended in the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance, the following measures are taken so that the time during which the financial statements are available to be reviewed is sufficient: preparatory meeting with the Committee Chair more than one week prior to the meeting, as provided for above; files made available to Committee members five to seven days in advance. These measures enable the members to review the financial statements well in advance of the meeting. When compatible with the schedules of the members travelling from abroad, the Committee meetings relating to the financial statements are held the day before the Board meeting.",

This joint session, requested by the Directors in the\n\nBoard's evaluation questionnaire at the end of 2017, permits good interaction between the two Committees, in particular with regard to the review of risks. The Audit Committee reviews the control procedures for the whole of the risks, including any environmental and societal risks, which are examined in detail by the Environment and Society Committee. The joint session thus makes it possible for the members to discuss subjects which concern both the Committees.\n\nThe joint session also helps ensure a consistent approach, as reflected in the reconciliation of the financial and extra-financial data in the Integrated Management Report.\n\nDuring the joint session held in June 2020, the members of the Audit Committee and of the Environment and Society Committee reviewed the mapping of environmental and societal risks and the procedures to control these risks. They also conducted a more granular analysis of a number of specific environmental and societal risks, including in particular safety, the diversity policy, and monitoring climate objectives.",

Taking into consideration the diversity policy discussed on pages 121-122, it made recommendations on the desirable future changes in the composition of the Board of Directors in the short and medium-term and continued to manage the search and assessment procedure for potential candidates.\n\nAs a result of these searches, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that it propose to the General Meeting of May 5, 2020 the appointment of Anette Bronder and Kim Ann Mink as Directors. The Committee also recommended to the Board that it propose to the General Meeting of May 4, 2021 the appointment of Pierre Breber, Aiman Ezzat and Bertrand Dumazy (for more details, see page 133).\n\nThe Committee also recommended submitting the renewal of Brian Gilvary's term of office to the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, as well as Xavier Huillard's term of office to the General Meeting of May 4, 2021.\n\nPursuant to the PACTE Law, the Committee proposed amending the articles of association in order to provide for the appointment of a second Director representing employees, if the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is more than eight (and no longer twelve). The amendment to the articles of association was approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020. The Committee was informed of the appointment of Fatima Tighlaline as Director representing the employees by the European Works Council on October 1, 2020.\n\n## Concerning the composition of the Committees, the Lead Director and the Working Group\n\nThe Committee reviewed the composition of the Committees and the 'Shareholder Relations' Working Group. In this regard, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, given the termination of the terms of office of Pierre Dufour and Karen Katen as Directors at the end of the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, to appoint with effect from that date, (i) Annette Winkler as Chair of the Environment and Society Committee, as a replacement for Pierre Dufour, (ii) Xavier Huillard as a member of the Appointments and Governance Committee, as a replacement for Karen Katen and (iii) Brian Gilvary as a member of the Remuneration Committee, as a replacement for Annette Winkler. The Board meeting on May 5, 2020 approved this new composition of the Committees.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the composition of the Committees at the beginning of 2021 taking account of the appointment of Fatima Tighlaline as a Director representing the employees (see page 142) and the non renewal of Thierry Peugeot's term of office at the General Meeting of May 4, 2021. The Committee did not propose any changes to the composition of the Committees at this stage.\n\n## Concerning the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the management teams\n\nThe Committee reviewed the specific procedure and the scenario envisaged in the event of the replacement of the General Management in an emergency situation. This procedure is reviewed each year and updated where applicable. At the beginning of 2021, it was slightly\n\nmodified in order to take into account recent legal and regulatory evolutions (PACTE Law).\n\nThe Committee reviewed the organization of the Group and its management teams. It conducted a detailed review of high-potential profiles, a process it undertakes regularly. It closely examined the composition of the management teams and succession planning.\n\nThe Committee has made preparing a succession plan for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer a consistent priority and held an additional meeting on this subject in October 2020.\n\n## Concerning governance\n\nThe Committee reviewed the organization of the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, which was held in closed session due to the pandemic, examining in particular the measures implemented to ensure the integrity of all aspects of the meeting in respect of shareholders' rights.\n\nThe Committee looked at the personal situation of each member of the Board of Directors in light of the independence criteria set forth in the internal regulations. In particular, it reviewed the chart summarizing the flows (purchases and sales) which occurred during the past fiscal year as between the companies in the Air Liquide Group and those Group companies at which a Director of Air Liquide (or candidate proposed for such office) also exercises a term of office or an executive role and made its assessment in the light of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Pursuant to the AFEP/MEDEF Code, page 123 gives a table detailing each Director's position with respect to the independence criteria.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the level of attendance of each Director at the meetings of the Board of Directors and the Committees, which is shown in the table contained on page 124.\n\nThe Committee took note of the information provided by the Directors concerning their terms of office as Directors which are external to the Group.\n\nIt reviewed the recommendations of the Report of the Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise and the AMF Annual Report on Corporate Governance published in November 2020 and made its recommendations concerning the practices followed by the Company. It examined the draft of this section of the Universal Registration Document, incorporating part of the Report on Corporate Governance and recommended that it be adopted by the Board of Directors.\n\nIt examined the chart showing the deviations of the Group's practices as compared to the AFEP/MEDEF Code (see table on page 142 of this Universal Registration Document). Given the appointment of Fatima Tighlaline as second Director representing the employees, the Committee more particularly examined the deviation relating to the appointment of a Director representing the employees as a member of the Remuneration Committee. Philippe Dubrulle, Director representing the employees since 2014, is a member of the Environment and society committee bringing to this Committee the vision of Group employees, who are essential stakeholders. Fatima Tighlaline was appointed by the European work council on October 1, 2020. Given the very recent nature of her appointment, the Committee recommended that she should be allowed a period of adaptation and training before proposing her appointment to a Committee.\n\nAt the start of 2020, the Committee reviewed the summary of the replies to the full evaluation questionnaire of the Board of Directors in respect of the 2019 fiscal year. The summary was reported to the Board meeting in February 2020, including pending items. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Committee updated the content of the simplified evaluation questionnaire before sending it out to Directors. The questionnaire is intended to follow up implementation of the recommendations made in the aforementioned full evaluation. For more details on the evaluation of the Board of Directors, see page 131.",

In accordance with these new provisions, the Committee reviewed the draft reports and resolutions to be put to the General Meeting of May 5, 2020 concerning the remuneration of the corporate officers (a report containing information on the remuneration of the Executive Officer and the Directors and provided for in article L. 225-37-3-I of the French Commercial Code) and the Executive Officer's remuneration for 2019.\n\nIn this regard, the Committee made recommendations concerning the remuneration policy for the corporate officers, which now includes the remuneration of the Directors and which was the subject of a resolution put to the General Meeting on May 5, 2020. It examined the possible alternatives to the defined benefit pension plan which Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from and recommended the implementation of a collective pension insurance contract with individual subscription, with effect from January 1, 2020. This implementation was integrated into the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020.\n\nAs part of its work regarding the granting of performance shares and/or stock options, the Committee recommended amending the performance conditions, providing a new criterion linked to Air Liquide's carbon intensity in the 2020 long-term incentive plans. It also renewed its recommendation to attribute performance shares only (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares as had been the case until 2018), in order to simplify and standardize the scheme.\n\nFor 2021, the Committee reviewed the remuneration policy of the corporate officers. He was informed of the global transfer of the\n\ndefined contribution pension plan set up for all employees and corporate officers to a PERO (Plan d'\u00c9pargne Retraite d'Entreprise Obligatoire - mandatory company pension plan) from January 1, 2021 for compliance with the new legal and regulatory framework arising from the PACTE Law. It recommended the corresponding adaptation of the remuneration policy, to be put to the General Meeting on May 4, 2021.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the satisfaction of the performance conditions in the 2018 LTI plans, for which the three-year review period expired on December 31, 2020. It recommended the performance conditions for the 2021 LTI plans, which have been then adopted by the Board of Directors in February 2021.\n\nFor the Board of Directors' meeting in February 2021, the Committee prepared the record of the performance conditions for 2020, which are applicable to the collective pension insurance contract from which Beno\u00eet Potier benefits.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the rules for holding shares which apply to the Executive Officers.\n\n## Remuneration of the Directors\n\nThe Committee made recommendations concerning the remuneration policy for Directors presented to the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, and concerning the level of remuneration for the Directors, pursuant to article L. 225-45 of the French Commercial Code (a) , to be granted in respect of the 2020 fiscal year within the total amount authorized by the General Meeting. The Committee also recommended the increase by the General Meeting of the amount of the remuneration that may be allocated each year to the Directors.\n\nThe Committee also recommended to propose to the General Meeting on May 4, 2021 to amend the remuneration policy in order to allocate the same remuneration for remote participation at meetings as for in-person attendance (instead of half the flat fee for each meeting) for meeting held since September 2020.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nAs part of its work, the Remuneration Committee analyses the shareholders interviews conducted as part of General Meeting preparations and the results of General Meeting votes on resolutions relating to remuneration.\n\nThe Committee looked at the measures on transparency and communication and issued its recommendations. It reviewed the section below on remuneration, enclosed in the Report on Corporate Governance (the section on remuneration), and recommended their approval by the Board of Directors.",

The conclusions of the meetings of the Environment and Society Committee are presented by the Committee Chair for discussion and, if applicable, for a decision by the Board of Directors at a later Board meeting. The Committee may be assisted by external experts.\n\nRegular reports are made to the Committe by the member of the Executive Committee in charge of sustainable development on the Group's sustainable development strategy and its implementation.\n\n## The Environment and Society Committee's work in 2020\n\nThe Environment and Society Committee met three times in 2020, with an effective attendance rate, or attendance rate by telephone, of 100% of its members.\n\nAt these meetings, the Committee reviewed, in particular, the Group's environmental and societal risks, the changes to such risks, and the related monitoring procedures, taking into account the regulations concerning the duty of vigilance owed by parent companies. The Committee reviewed the environmental and societal risk-mapping which forms part of the Group's general risk-mapping. As part of the Group's Sustainable Development strategy, the Committee was provided with an update on the Climate Objectives defined by the\n\nGroup which were published on November 30, 2018. A review was also carried out on the development of new ESG / climate objectives.\n\nInformation was also presented to the Committee on specific issues concerning, in particular, preventing industrial risks, ensuring people's safety by preventing accidents and in the pandemic, and monitoring the objectives and work of the Air Liquide Foundation.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the information in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration in this Universal Registration Document and monitored the work undertaken to revise the Vigilance Plan, as well as the follow-up on the implementation of the materiality matrix. Furthermore, the Committee read the report summarizing the Group's extra-financial ratings. It also drew up a draft work program for 2021.\n\nIn the interests of smooth coordination, the Environment and Society Committee and the Audit and Accounts Committee meet in joint session once a year. See page 136 of this Document for information on the 2020 joint session.\n\nMeeting documentation is prepared and made available to members in electronic format via a dedicated platform several days before each meeting of the Environment and Society Committee. At the meeting, each presentation made gives rise to discussion. An oral report and then written minutes of each meeting are prepared for the Board of Directors.",

In a highly capital-intensive industry, profitable long-term growth requires constant attention to be paid to each investment decision and to the competitiveness of every transaction, while maintaining an on-going effort over time in favor, in particular, of safety and security, innovation, employee training and development, together with the sustainable development. In this context, the elements taken into account for the determination of the remuneration of the Executive Officers are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 a short-term component, comprising a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 a long-term incentive (hereinafter the 'LTI' ) through the grant of share subscription options and/or performance shares, both tools being subject in full to all the same performance conditions calculated over three years;\n- \u25a0 other benefits attached to the performance of the Executive Officers' term of office, including:\n- - a supplementary pension mechanism (a) , comprising specifically for Beno\u00eet Potier, and with effect from January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract subject to performance conditions, which from this date has replaced the defined benefit pension plan which applies to eligible senior managers and Executive Officers and is applicable for the period up to December 31, 2019,\n- - a collective life insurance plan,\n- - a death and disability benefits plan,\n- - commitments to pay an indemnity in the event of the termination of duties at the Company's initiative, in certain circumstances, subject to performance conditions calculated over a three-year period,\n- - entitlement to unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers, in the absence of an employment contract with the Group.\n\nTo determine the remuneration policy, the Board of Directors takes into account the principles of completeness, balance, comparability, consistency, comprehensibility and proportionality as recommended by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nThe remuneration policy reflects the level of responsibility of the Group's senior executives and is adapted to the Group context, remains competitive and is an incentive to promote the Group's performance over the medium to long-term, in compliance with the corporate interest and the interests of all the stakeholders.",

Remuneration of the Executive Officer (including information stated in article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-9 I of the French Commercial Code)\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in relation to his office, as decided upon by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2020 and presented in the 2019 Universal Registration Document (pages 178 to 186) was approved by the Ordinary General Meeting on May 5, 2020 (11 th resolution). This General Meeting also approved for the first time the information relating to the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Directors which was presented in the Report on Corporate Governance (a) (10 th resolution).\n\nThe Board of Directors maintained the fixed remuneration for 2020 at the same level as for 2018 and 2019, the level of the total annual target remuneration being thus stable.\n\nIn 2020, the structure and principles which apply to the remuneration are in line with earlier fiscal years, although some adjustments have been made taking into account remarks from shareholders. Moreover, amendments have been made to the pension mechanism following the PACTE Law of May 22, 2019 and Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019.\n\nThe principal elements of the remuneration policy approved in 2020 are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 In accordance with a recurring practice at Air Liquide, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration 35% and the long-term incentive (hereafter 'LTI') 40% of the total annual remuneration. Accordingly, the weight of the variable remuneration and the LTI, which are subject to performance conditions, represents approximately 75% of this total remuneration.\n\nThe collective pension insurance contract and the termination indemnity are also subject to performance conditions.\n\nThe performance conditions, as described below, reflect the Group's ambition to achieve profitable long-term growth, while acting responsibly in the interests of all the stakeholders.\n\n## \u25a0 Variable remuneration:\n\n- - the variable part is expressed as a target variable remuneration and as a maximum (as a % of the fixed remuneration). For the quantifiable criteria, the target variable remuneration corresponds to an achievement of 100% of the target objective set at the start of the year. The fixed target objectives are demanding and are completely consistent with the trajectory of the NEOS company program;\n- - a greater relative weight is given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria.\n- - a weighting continues to be given to each of the qualitative criteria in order to meet the expectations of certain shareholders.\n\n## \u25a0 LTI:\n\n- -All the LTI granted to the Executive Officers are subject to performance conditions calculated over a period of three years. As of 2020, the LTI plans incorporate a new performance condition linked to the Group's Carbon Intensity, in addition to the ROCE and TSR criteria. The objective of this new condition is consistent with the trajectory of the Group's Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018 and which aim to reduce Carbon Intensity by 30% between 2015 and 2025.\n- - Limits on the grants to Executive Officers: in accordance with the authorizations given by the General Meeting on May 7, 2019, the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital and the number of stock options granted if any to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.2% of the share capital. The Board of Directors also sets annual limits for the grants, which remain well below these sub-limits, it being noted, moreover, that, as stated above, the LTI must represent approximately 40% of the annual remuneration for the Executive Officer.\n- - The other principles which apply to the LTI are unchanged (proration of the LTI in the event of the Executive Officer's departure during the period of assessment of the performance conditions, the level of requirement of the objectives, the rules which apply to the Executive Officers as described on pages 167-168).\n- \u25a0 In accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription is set up as from January 1, 2020, specifically for Beno\u00eet Potier in order to replace the acquisition of rights under the defined benefit pension plan with effect from such date pursuant to the PACTE Law of May 22, 2019 and Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019 (see details below).\n\nFinally, as in 2019, the Board of Directors decided on September 29, 2020 only to grant performance shares (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all the beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the LTI plan.\n\nThe elements of Beno\u00eet Potier's remuneration, as determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, are described below.",

This contract was set up with effect on January 1, 2020, following legislative changes and in accordance with the remuneration policy. It replaces the acquisition of conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan with effect from this date in order to maintain rights which are equivalent to those which would have existed under such plan, if it had been possible to maintain them for Beno\u00eet Potier. Details of these plans are set forth below.\n- (c)  Amount already approuved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020 (9 th r\u00e9solution).\n\nWithin the fixed remuneration and the variable remuneration in respect of 2020, after recording the achievement of the criteria for the variable remuneration in respect of the 2020 fiscal year by the Board meeting of February 9, 2021, the fixed remuneration represents 47.6% and the variable remuneration represents 52.4%**. For the record, in respect of 2019, the fixed remuneration represented 39% and the variable remuneration (paid in 2020) represented 61%.\n\n## 2.1.1. Fixed remuneration for 2020\n\nIn accordance with the policy approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, the fixed remuneration was determined taking account of the level of responsibilities, the experience in executive management duties and market practices.\n\nAs announced, the Executive Officer's fixed remuneration for 2020 amounts to 1,325,000 euros, stable since 2018.\n\n## 2.1.2. Variable remuneration for 2020 for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe principles and criteria for the variable remuneration, as decided upon by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2020 were approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020 (11 th resolution).\n\nOn the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021 assessed the performance of the Executive Officer in 2020.\n\nThe criteria for the variable remuneration, their weighting and their rate of achievement are detailed in the following summary table.\n\n## A. Quantifiable financial criteria\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, the variable remuneration for 2020 is based on two financial criteria: increase in recurring net earnings per share (hereinafter 'recurring EPS' ) and comparable growth in consolidated revenue . Details of these criteria are contained in the following summary table (page 165).\n\nThe increase in the recurring EPS criterion makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of an increase in sales reflects the momentum of the activity. These two criteria, growth in revenue and the recurring EPS, reflect the Group's ambition to achieve profitable growth. Moreover, the NEOS company program also incorporated efficiency objectives, the achievement of which contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\n- * The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not receive any remuneration from Group companies other than L'Air Liquide S.A.\n- ** As approved by the General Meeting on May 7, 2019 and in accordance with a recurring practice at Air Liquide, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration 35% and the LTI 40% of total annual remuneration. After the Board meeting of February 9, 2021 recorded the achievement of the criteria for the variable remuneration for the 2020 fiscal year, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 26%, the variable remuneration 29% (due to the sanitary crisis that minored the achievement level of the 2020 quantifiable objectives - cf. infra) and the LTI 45% of the total annual remuneration (the LTI being subject to performance conditions over three years).",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nFor each criterion, the Board of Directors had defined a target objective. The target objectives were exacting and were completely consistent with the trajectory of the NEOS company program which targeted, for the period 2016-2020, average annual growth in Group revenue of +6% to +8%, including a scope impact linked to the consolidation of Airgas corresponding to +2% as an annual average. These ambitious objectives were set before the covid-19 health crisis and have not been reviewed despite this context. Therefore, these objectives apply to the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nA formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set, the value of the variable remuneration is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the fraction of the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero.\n\nAccording to this formula, the rate of achievement of each objective is calculated linearly as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an initial linear gradient between the lower limit of the objective, corresponding to the trigger threshold (0% below this threshold) and the target (corresponding to a 100% achievement of the objective);\n- \u25a0 a second linear gradient between the target (100%) and the maximum achievement level (116% of the target).\n\nThe objectives are not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nevertheless, the rate of achievement of each objective for the variable remuneration (as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to that criterion) is communicated in the summary table at page 165.\n\nAt the end of an extraordinary year 2020, marked by the covid-19 pandemic , the Group has demonstrated the strength and resilience of its business model. Revenue has been gradually recovering since the third quarter of 2020, and is thus almost stable as compared to 2019 on a comparable basis. Recurring net profit (Group share) excluding foreign exchange impact is in turn increasing by more than 4% compared with 2019. Concerning the Executive Officer's remuneration, the quantifiable criteria objectives for 2020 (increase in recurring EPS excluding foreign exchange impact and comparable growth in consolidated revenue), set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2020, i.e. before the development of the pandemic and the unprecedented crisis which followed, could not, for obvious reasons, be fully achieved, which results in a reduction in Beno\u00eet Potier's variable remuneration compared with 2019. The Board of Directors has, however, decided, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, not to adjust the financial criteria objectives during the course of the year, so that the level of the Executive Officer's variable remuneration reflects the true economic situation.\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration is below target and amounts to 1,459,719 euros, down by -29.3% as compared to the variable remuneration for 2019.\n\n## B. Qualitative personal criteria\n\nPursuant to the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, the variable remuneration for 2020 is also based on the following (qualitative) personal criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter 'CSR'):\n- - Safety and reliability: continue efforts to improve safety (lost time accident frequency rate, road traffic accidents and job-related accidents);\n- - Continue the roll-out of the Sustainable Development strategy (Implementation of the Group's Climate Objectives - Air Liquide Foundation - Contribution to the development of the hydrogen ecosystem).\n- \u25a0 Organization/Human Resources (talent development, succession plans, diversity policy).\n- \u25a0 Individual performance: this criterion responds to the Board of Directors' desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer, if the Company is facing an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nAn identical target and maximum weight are set for each qualitative criterion.\n\nFor 2020, after a detailed analysis by the Remuneration Committee of the achievements for the fiscal year, the Board of Directors noted the following elements concerning each of the personal criteria:\n\n## CSR:\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\n## \u25a0 Continue the roll-out of the Sustainable Development strategy:\n\nImplementation of the Group's Climate objectives: The Environment and Society Committee met on three occasions in 2020. It reviewed the governance put in place to monitor and advance the roll-out of the Climate Objectives announced by the Group at the end of 2018, together with the environmental and societal risks and the Vigilance Plan.\n\nConcerning the achievement of the climate Objectives, and in particular the 30% reduction in the Group's Carbon Intensity between 2015 and 2025, this reduction continued in 2020. All country groups (industrial clusters) have drawn up their Climate roadmap up until 2025, with a detailed action plan for each of the three topics: Assets/Customers/Ecosystems.\n\nIn each of these groups of countries (clusters), a Climate Champion is responsible for coordinating this matter and volunteer Climate Ambassadors carry out local initiatives and share good practices.\n\nThe Group has reinforced its strategic analysis on energy transition and launched a review of its climate objectives, which will be communicated on March 23, 2021 at a Sustainable Development Day.",

Since 2019, this facility provides for a correlation mechanism between its financial costs and three CSR objectives in the areas of carbon intensity, gender diversity, and safety.\n\nContribution to the development of the Hydrogen Ecosystem: Beno\u00eet Potier is co-Chair of the Hydrogen Council. This Council, formed in 2017, brings together over 100 leaders in the energy, transport and industry sectors in order to promote hydrogen with a view to achieving climate change objectives. At the annual meeting in January 2020 in Versailles, the chairmen and chief executive officers presented the results of the latest report: 'Path to Hydrogen Competitiveness: A Cost Perspective' which shows that the cost of hydrogen solutions should fall more rapidly than previously expected. Hydrogen is now recognized as a key element for a low-carbon future.\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier was also involved in setting up the French National Hydrogen Council, made up of around fifteen French industrialists, tasked with contributing to the roll-out of carbon-free hydrogen in France, the creation of which was announced by the government in September 2020. He was appointed co-chair thereof on January 11, 2021.\n\nHe had also chaired the panel of experts mandated by the French government within the framework of the Productive Pact, announced by the President of the Republic in April 2019, to identify those emerging markets where France should position itself. In this regard, he submitted the panel's report to the government on February 7, 2020, which proposes to select 22 key markets, including 10 priority markets, of which hydrogen is one.\n\nIn September 2020, an in-depth session of the Board of Directors was organized on Hydrogen and energy transition, with the intervention of some high-profile personalities from outside the Company and from members of the management and operations teams. In December 2020, Air Liquide, in the presence of Beno\u00eet Potier and with the participation of Bertrand Piccard, Initiator and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, organized the 'Hydrogen Generation' digital event, in partnership with the Les Echos - Le Parisien group and Usbek & Rica, concerning the role of hydrogen in energy transition.\n\nAir Liquide Foundation: The covid-19 pandemic has made strong demands on the Foundation partners, research teams and NGOs, in France and abroad. The Foundation has been able to react quickly to this crisis thanks to its founders, L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Liquide Sant\u00e9 International (exceptional support of more than 2 millions euros, a significant portion of which has already been committed in 2020), to its Board of Directors, its partners and its network of Group employees.\n\nThe Foundation's covid-19 initiative aims at allowing understanding the effect of the coronavirus on the respiratory system (10 research projects) and at addressing emergency humanitarian needs (23 projects supported in France and abroad). One-third of the NGOs involved are new partners for the Foundation, introduced by Group employees during this crisis.\n\nIn total, the Foundation has approved in 2020 a record of 69 projects over the year, notably in the scientific field, and promoting professional integration, education and disability, both in France and abroad.\n\nIn a survey of individual shareholders of Air Liquide, which collected over 6,000 responses, the shareholders expressed strong support for the work of the Foundation.\n\n- \u25a0 Safety and reliability: based on the estimated hours worked, the lost-time accident frequency rate of Group employees stood at 0.9 in 2020, compared to 1.2 in 2019 and 1.3 in 2018. This is the Group's best performance since the introduction of this indicator.\n- However, 2020 was marked by the deaths of 2 employees and of a subcontracted driver. In 2020, road safety formed part of a consolidated action plan aimed at raising awareness of all persons affected and at introducing technical assistance tools in vehicles, as commenced a few years ago and continued in 2020 despite the public health crisis. Concerning industrial safety / reliability, the Group's IMS (Industrial Management System) program set up 15 years ago has helped improve the management of industrial risks. The new IMS reference system was rolled out to around two-thirds of the clusters, the end of the roll-out to the remaining third being envisaged in mid-2022 due to the sanitary crisis.\n\nIn 2020, in terms of process safety, a plan to upgrade safety of the production sites has been rolled out and should be finalized by the end of 2021. The Board also noted the leading role of Air Liquide notably in developing harmonized international standards.\n\n## Organization/Human Resources:\n\nPerformance was considered excellent. In this context of a public health crisis, very particular attention has been paid to employee health since the start of the covid-19 crisis. Capitalizing on its international presence and its network organization, the Group set up a crisis unit, in February 2020, headed by the Director of Human Resources who reports to the Executive Committee. Accordingly, the experience of the Chinese subsidiaries was immediately put to good use.\n\nPsychological support, as well as proximity and communication with management have been strengthened. Special attention has been paid to employee commitment. A first worldwide survey, MyVoice, was launched as planned and specific questions have made it possible to monitor as closely as possible the feedback on the crisis. The roll-out of the 'BeActEngage' leadership program proceeded as planned, permitting regular exchanges, although all the workshops were conducted online.\n\nAn initial assessment of the crisis has been made and international teams have worked on four areas (teleworking, managerial support, relations with our customers and patients, and office design) to capitalize on the experience gained and accelerate our transformations.\n\nThe Executive Committee stepped up its meetings throughout the year to steer the Group, while pursuing its transformation and conducting strategic reflection in the context of accelerating trends (digital, energy transition and healthcare systems, in particular).\n\nSince continuity is key, the Group is pursuing its talent development policy. Despite the circumstances, regular reviews of talent and their development have been conducted online, at the level of operating clusters and up to Executive Committee level. Regular reviews of the most promising talent have taken place with the Appointments and Governance Committee.",

A 'diversity lab' was conducted with international HR leaders and managers to analyze all processes and practices, identify potential biases and implement corrective measures ('nudges') to limit those biases. Accordingly, as part of the regular reviews of talent with the highest potential, the diversity of profiles is taken into account, with the aim of continuing to enhance such diversity within the Group's key positions in order to promote the many cultures found within the Group and improve the gender balance.\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nThe individual performance was considered excellent, the executive officer having managed, in the context of a global crisis of unprecedented severity, to steer the Group and to further its development both in terms of performance and in terms of environmental and societal commitment.\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE OF THE VARIABLE REMUNERATION FOR 2020\n\n|                                                                                                                                                        | Approved elements by   the Annual General Meeting in 2020:   | Approved elements by   the Annual General Meeting in 2020:   | Approved elements by   the Annual General Meeting in 2020:   | Approved elements by   the Annual General Meeting in 2020:   |                                                         |                                    |                        |                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                        | Target  (a)                                                  | Target  (a)                                                  | Maximum                                                      | Maximum                                                      | Achievement  (d)                                        | Achievement  (d)                   | Achievement  (d)       | Achievement  (d)                      |\n| Indicator                                                                                                                                              | As a % of  the fixed  remuneration                           | As a %  based   on 100                                       | As a % of  the fixed  remuneration                           | As a %  based   on 100                                       | As a % of  the target  remuneration  for this criterion | As a % of  the fixed  remuneration | As a %  based   on 100 | In thousands  of euros  (rounded off) |\n| Financial criteria (quantifiable) including:                                                                                                           | 105                                                          | 70                                                           | 122                                                          | 73                                                           | -

LTI: STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES\n\n## 2.2.1. 2020 performance share plan (plan dated September 29, 2020)\n\n## A. Principles of grant for 2020\n\nFor the Executive Officer, the grant for 2020 forms part of the 2020 remuneration policy defined by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2020 and approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020.\n\nThe grant of LTI to Beno\u00eet Potier in 2020 represents an IFRS value of 2,249,629 euros, which is stable since 2018, as announced.\n\nMoreover, for 2020 and as in 2019, the Board of Directors on September 29, 2020 decided to grant only performance shares (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all the beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the LTI plan.\n\n## B. Performance conditions of the 2020 Plans\n\nAll the performance shares granted to any beneficiary are subject to performance conditions which are calculated over three years. The performance conditions were set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nFor reasons of confidentiality, the exact objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex post, at the end of the Board of Directors' meeting at the time when the financial statements are adopted for the 2022 fiscal year. The results achieved, the rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of performance shares definitively awarded will also be published at the end of this Board meeting. The percentage of performance shares definitively awarded may in no event exceed 100% of the initial grant.\n\nIn keeping with the Group's responsible growth approach, the 2020 performance share plans incorporate a new performance condition linked to the Group's carbon intensity. Accordingly, the number of performance shares definitively awarded pursuant to the 2020 Plans will depend:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax ( 'ROCE' (a) ) recorded at the end of the 2022 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective has been set within the trajectory of the NEOS company program which aimed at a ROCE of more than 10% in 2021-2022;\n\n## (ii)  for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n\n- - for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years ( 'AL TSR' ). The objective of an absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit below which there will be no grant,\n- - for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends - sourced from Bloomberg (' B TSR '), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg) for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years.\n- The rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least 2% higher than the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible.\n\nThe TSR criteria make it possible to align the Company's performance with shareholders' expectation of steady profits;\n\n- (iii) for 10% of the performance shares granted, on the reduction in Air Liquide's carbon intensity , defined as the following ratio, recorded as at December 31, 2022: Greenhouse gas emissions of the Air Liquide Group for 2022 in kg-equivalent CO2/2022 EBITDA (calculated at constant exchange rate on the basis of the 2015 foreign exchange rates) expressed in euros. For the purposes of this policy, greenhouse gas emissions include direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe objective was determined within the trajectory of the Group's Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018 which aim to reduce the carbon intensity by 30% between 2015 and 2025.",

Rules applying to the Executive Officers\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy, the grant to the Executive Officers is examined by the Remuneration Committee at the same time as the allocation to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe grant of LTI was examined in light of the total amount of the Executive Officer's annual remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the shareholders are respected.\n\nBefore the grant, it was verified that the conditions provided for in article L. 225-197-6 (a) of the French Commercial Code, which aims at involving all staff in France in the Company's performance are satisfied. Therefore in 2020, over 98% of all the employees in the Company and in the Group's French entities are covered by an incentive plan or a special or voluntary profit-sharing plan.\n\n## Limits on the grants to the Executive Officers\n\nWithin the scope of the sub-limits authorized for 38 months by the General Meeting, the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage of the share capital and (ii) as a multiple of their remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe limits set by the Board of Directors for 2020 are identical to those for 2019 and are as follows (no subscription option having been attributed in 2020):\n\n- (i) the total number of performance shares granted to the sole Executive Officer in 2020 cannot give rise to a number of shares in excess of 0.012% of the share capital (it being understood that an allocation sub-limit of 0.1% of the share capital for 38 months was set by the General Meeting on May 7, 2019);\n- (ii) the maximum aggregate IFRS value of the performance shares granted to the Executive Officer cannot exceed approximately 1.5 times the amount of the Executive Officer's maximum gross annual remuneration (fixed + variable maximum), it being noted that the performance shares granted represent approximately 40% of the total target annual remuneration.\n\n## Proration principle\n\nPursuant to the decision made by the Board on February 10, 2020 and the policy approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, the 2020 grant of LTI to the Executive Officer remains subject to the principle of a pro rata calculation.\n\nIn practice, if the Executive Officer leaves the Group for a reason other than his resignation or removal from office for serious cause (b) , the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) would be reduced pro rata the number of months' actual presence of the Executive Officer at the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria. Furthermore, no grant is made to the Executive Officer at the time of this departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Executive Officer will remain subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating to the duration of the vesting, lock-up and holding periods in respect of the shares and stock options granted.\n\n## Shareholding and share ownership obligations\n\n## Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code\n\nOn the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board defined the shareholding obligations resulting from articles L. 225-185 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code applicable to the shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and performance shares, respectively, as from September 28, 2015, as follows:\n\nFor each stock option/performance share plan granted to the Executive Officers with effect from September 28, 2015, the Executive Officers shall hold, in registered form, until the termination of their duties, a minimum quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock options/each definitive award of performance shares.\n\nHowever, this percentage will be lowered to 5%, as soon as the quantity of shares held by the Executive Officer resulting from the exercise of stock options or the definitive award of performance shares (all plans combined since the 2007 plan for Beno\u00eet Potier) represents a minimum amount equal to at least three times the Executive Officer's gross annual fixed remuneration.\n\nThis rule is regularly reviewed by the Board at the time of each grant. In 2020, the Board of Directors decided to maintain this rule in identical form.",

This obligation will remain in force, until it is exceeded by the effect of the aforementioned rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. The Board noted that the valuation of the shares held as at January 1 and July 1, 2020 and as at January 1, 2021 by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was much greater than the amounts required and concluded that the shareholding obligation was complied with by the Executive Officer.\n\nRecommendations encouraging the ownership of a minimum number of Company shares equivalent to 0.5 times their gross fixed annual remuneration, have also been made to members of the Executive Committee since 2009.\n\n## Other rules applicable to the Executive Officers\n\n- \u25a0 Restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication of the financial statements. These abstention periods open 30 days before the announcement of the annual and half-year consolidated results and 15 calendar days prior to the publication of the quarterly financial information. They end on the date of publication of the information at close of business.\n- \u25a0 Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning the performance shares awarded/options arising from the exercise of options, throughout the length of their term of office.\n\n## 2.2.2. Grants to the Executive Officer within the scope of the September 29, 2020 plan\n\n## Plan Regulations\n\nThe grant to the Executive Officer is governed by the September 29, 2020 'France' performance share plan which applies to all the beneficiaries in France. This Plan contains:\n\n- \u25a0 a three-year vesting period;\n- \u25a0 followed by a two-year holding period during which the shares cannot be sold.\n\n## DIAGRAM OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE MECHANISM - 2020 PLAN (FRANCE)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContinued presence in the Company is a condition under the Plan in order to qualify for performance shares at the end of the vesting period, the loss of rights for the Executive Officer occurring in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause.\n\nThe Executive Officer is also subject to additional conditions as described above.",

Recording of the achievement of the performance conditions under the September 25, 2018 stock option and performance share plans (a)\n\nOn the basis of the financial statements for the 2020 fiscal year submitted for the approval of the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021 recorded the rate of achievement of the performance conditions, which apply to the whole of the performance shares and stock options awarded to any beneficiary and were determined at the time of the grant of the September 25, 2018 performance share and stock option plans.\n\nThe annual 2018 plans provided that the number of stock options which could effectively be exercised out of the total number of stock options granted, together with the number of performance shares definitively awarded, would depend on the rate of achievement of the following objectives:\n\n- (i) for 65% of the stock options/performance shares granted, an objective of the average annual increase in the undiluted Recurring Earnings Per Share excluding the impact of foreign exchange and significant exceptional items 'recurring EPS' for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 fiscal years set at +6% (a) in order to be able to exercise all the stock options and (b) in order for all the shares to be awarded, and then decreasing on a straight-line basis to 0% growth.\n\nThe average annual growth of recurring EPS over the aforementioned period amounts to +6.9%, i.e. an objective achieved as to 100%;\n\n- (ii)  for 35% of the stock options/performance shares granted, an objective of Total Shareholder Return:\n- - for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): of an objective of Total Shareholder Return defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, with dividends reinvested, for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 fiscal years (' AL TSR '). The objective was set at +6% (a) in order to be able to exercise all stock options, and (b) in order for all shares to be awarded and then decreasing on a straight-line basis to +2%.\n- This growth, over the aforementioned period, amounts to +14.95% per annum, i.e. an objective achieved as to 100%;\n- - for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends - sourced from Bloomberg (' B TSR '), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg), for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 fiscal years.\n- The applicable formula provided that the rate of achievement of this performance condition was (i) 0% if the average Air Liquide TSR was lower than the average CAC 40 TSR, (ii) 50% if the average Air Liquide TSR was equal to the average CAC 40 TSR, and (iii) 100% if the average Air Liquide TSR was at least 2% higher than the average CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR was impossible.\n- The rate of return for Air Liquide over the aforementioned period is 15.21%. That of the CAC 40 index over the same period is 5.78%. This gives the difference between the average rate of return for Air Liquide and the average rate of return for the CAC 40 as 9.43%, i.e. an objective achieved as to 100%.\n\nConsequently, the Board of Directors recorded that the rate of achievement of the performance conditions for the September 25, 2018 stock option and share performance plans amounts to 100% .

For the Executive Officer, these elements and the corresponding amounts due or awarded in respect of 2020 are contained at pages 180 to 185 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## For employees:\n\nIndividual bonuses (seniority bonuses, study bursary, vacation, accommodation, transportation, etc.), profit-sharing bonus, incentives, and employer's contribution on profit-sharing/incentives.\n\nThe post-employment benefits, and notably the pension and similar commitments have not been taken into account in the calculations. For the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, these elements are presented at pages 185 to 187. The only amount that will be paid directly to Beno\u00eet Potier in 2021 in respect of 2020 relates to the collective pension insurance contract that has been set up, following legislative changes and in accordance with the remuneration policy, as of January 1, 2020, to replace the acquisition of conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan with effect from that date and in order to maintain equivalent rights to those that would have existed under this plan, if it could have been maintained for Beno\u00eet Potier. This amount stands at 170,000 euros in respect of 2020 and is intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract. Taking this amount into consideration, the ratios for 2020 amount to 50 (remuneration ratio compared to the employee average) and 72 (remuneration ratio compared to the employee median), i.e. a low impact.\n\n- (b)  The data for 2019, which had been presented as an estimate, based on the nominal/target variable component in the 2019 Universal Registration Document, has been updated.\n- (c)  The data for 2020 is presented as an estimate, based on the nominal/target variable component (value of variable components in respect of 2020 not known for the entire perimeter of the Company at the date of publication). The final ratios based on the variable remunerations paid in respect of 2020 will be published in the 2021 Universal Registration Document. Given the specific context due to covid-19, Beno\u00eet Potier's variable remuneration in respect of 2020 is below the target, down by -29.3% as compared to the variable remuneration in respect of 2019. As a consequence, Beno\u00eet Potier's remuneration defined above is down by -10.7% as compared to 2019. The employees' variable remuneration is being calculated at the date of this Universal Registration Document. Given its limited weight in the average of employee total remuneration, the final ratios for 2020 should be lower than those mentioned in the table above.\n- (d)  L'Air Liquide S.A. is the listed company, which has more than 1,000 employees (Head Office, R&D, Innovation, and European Projects).

LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS\n\nThe elements set out below which Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from are taken into account for the determination of his total remuneration.\n\n## 2.4.1. Company's pension and similar benefit obligations\n\nIn addition to the mandatory basic and supplementary pension schemes (Agirc/Arrco) with which he is, or was affiliated, Beno\u00eet Potier has been authorized to benefit from various supplementary social benefit schemes set up by L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## A. Defined benefit pension plan\n\nPursuant to PACTE Law No. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 and Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019 on supplementary professional pension plans, the defined benefit pension plan described below no longer grants a right to acquire supplementary conditional rights as of January 1, 2020. The conditional rights to which Beno\u00eet Potier is entitled pursuant to this plan for the period running up until December 31, 2019 shall continue to be subject to the plan's regulations, including in particular the condition that he ends his professional career with the Company. As from January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription has been established to replace the acquisition of rights under the defined benefit pension plan.\n\nPursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 137-11 of the same Code, the collective defined benefit pension plan 'S' had been set up by Air Liquide for the benefit of the employee senior executives and executive officers:\n\n- (i) whose remuneration exceeded 24 times the annual social security ceiling (PASS);\n- (ii) who had a total of three years' length of service with the Air Liquide Group, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance; and\n- (iii)  who were not classed as a participant under the supplementary defined benefit pension plan with guaranteed cover ('garantie de ressources') which was closed in 1996.\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier's rights under this plan:\n\n- (i) may be applied for, if the beneficiary definitively ends his professional career with the Company and decides to claim his mandatory basic and supplementary pension (Arrco/Agirc) entitlements, whether or not at the full rate.\n- In the event of the termination of his corporate office at the Company's initiative, a beneficiary who is over 55 years of age and has at least five years' length of service shall retain his rights, if he does not resume any professional activity until his retirement. The condition of ending his career at the Company is then considered to be met, as he has not performed any activity after leaving the Company. This rule, which is in line with the position of the social security administration reflects the Human Resources policy at Air Liquide, for which long careers within the Group constitute a key element; given the length of service of the potential beneficiaries of this plan, some of whom have spent the whole of their career at the Group, it would not be justified for them to lose the benefit of this plan in the event of a forced departure (except in the event of gross or willful misconduct) at the end of their careers.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the position of the social security administration, the rules also provide for the maintenance of the potential rights of the beneficiaries in the event of a disability of the 2 nd or 3 rd category;\n\n- * See definition on previous page.",

The basis for calculation of the pension annuity will be limited to the fixed and variable remuneration only, to the exclusion of any other form of remuneration, whether paid by the Company or by any French or foreign subsidiary. For this calculation, the average of the total variable portions taken into account cannot exceed 100% of the average of the total fixed portions taken into account. Where applicable, an annuity equal to 60% of the aforementioned benefits will be paid to the surviving spouse, subject to certain conditions, notably with regard to age;\n- (iii)  will be capped, in all cases, as they are for all the senior managers and executives benefiting from the defined benefit plan, and for all pension plans combined, whether public or private, in France or abroad, at 45% of the Reference Remuneration. Should this ceiling be reached, the amount paid under the defined benefit plan would be reduced accordingly;\n- (iv)  have been the subject of:\n- - contributions paid to an insurance body, that are deductible from the corporate income tax base, and\n- - provisions in the Group's consolidated financial statements;\n- (v)  are estimated, as at December 31, 2020, at 648,379 euros gross per year, Beno\u00eet Potier having a total of 38.6 years' length of service in the Group as at December 31, 2019;\n- (vi)  will be subject to the employer's contribution due on pension annuities provided for by article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 32%.\n\nThe application of this plan to Beno\u00eet Potier has been authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010, February 17, 2014 and February 14, 2018 and approved, in resolutions specific to Beno\u00eet Potier, by the General Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9 th resolution), May 7, 2014 (10 th resolution) and May 16, 2018 (10 th resolution). Between May 16, 2018 and December 31, 2019 (when the scheme was frozen as per Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019), an increase in Beno\u00eet Potier's conditional entitlements under the scheme was subject to performance conditions. These performance conditions were similar to those now applicable to Beno\u00eet Potier under the collective pension insurance contract set up on January 1, 2020 to replace the defined benefit pension plan (see details below).\n\n## B. Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (as of January 1, 2020)\n\nAs additional conditional rights can no longer be acquired under the defined benefit pension plan as of January 1, 2020 (see above), a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (known as 'article 82 of the French General Tax Code') was introduced to replace the acquisition of rights under the defined benefit pension plan as of this date.\n\nPursuant to the PACTE Law and Ordinance No. 2019-1234 of November 27, 2019, implementation of this new system for the benefit of Beno\u00eet Potier was approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020 pursuant to the remuneration policy (11 th resolution).\n\nIn this system, the amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount will be paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThis mechanism is specific to Beno\u00eet Potier and adapted to his individual situation in light of his seniority and the fact that it is only intended to apply up until the end of his career as an Executive Officer. It is without prejudice to the mechanism which would apply in the future to a new Executive Officer.\n\nThis mechanism was selected from among several alternatives and represents the lowest cost for the Company, being over 20% less than that of the previous plan (see description of this plan in \u00a7A above). For Beno\u00eet Potier, it simply supplements the rights accumulated under the defined benefit pension plan and makes it possible to maintain rights which are equivalent to those which would have existed under such plan, if it had been possible to maintain them for Beno\u00eet Potier. Although, pursuant to the new legislation, this pension insurance contract is not subject to a condition of the beneficiary's presence at the Company at the end of his career, in any event, with regard to Beno\u00eet Potier, the application of this condition under the defined benefit pension plan has become very theoretical: a beneficiary who is over 55 years of age and has at least five years' length of service (which is the case for Beno\u00eet Potier) shall retain his rights, even if his term of office is terminated provided that he does not resume any professional activity before his retirement. Consequently, the fact that this condition does not apply to the new mechanism is neutral in this specific situation.\n\nThe gross annual contribution amounts to approximately 10% of the annual target fixed and variable remuneration for 2020, subject to the achievement of similar performance conditions to those which apply to the defined benefit pension plan, which had been determined by the Board of Directors and approved by the General Meeting of May 16, 2018 in its 10 th resolution. Consequently, the amount of contributions for a fiscal year depends on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC is measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps is calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.",

Accordingly, the amount to be paid in 2021 in respect of 2020 under the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription will amount to 340,000 euros (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2021, between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nIn respect of this financial year, under the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription:\n\n- \u25a0 rights acquired correspond to 10.3% of the target fixed and variable remuneration for 2020;\n- \u25a0 In the event of a conversion of the capital into a life annuity, Beno\u00eet Potier's rights under this plan are estimated, at December 31, 2020 at 6,800 euros gross per year.\n\n## C. Defined contribution pension plans\n\n- \u25a0 Pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, the Air Liquide Group has set up, at several companies including L'Air Liquide S.A., a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of all the employees.\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier's pension entitlements under this plan:\n\n- - may be applied for, at the earliest, when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme;\n- - are or have been financed by monthly contributions broken down as follows: 50% borne by the Company and 50% borne by the beneficiary;\n- - these contributions are assessed on bracket 1 (formerly bracket A) (the portion of remuneration that is less than one PASS) at a rate of 2.32%, and on bracket 2 (formerly brackets B and C) (those portions of remuneration amounting, respectively, to between one PASS and eight times the PASS) at a rate of 6.50%. Furthermore, they are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at the rate of 20%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of five times the PASS;\n- - are estimated, as at December 31, 2020, at 8,507 euros gross per year.\n\nThe individual application of this plan to Beno\u00eet Potier was authorized by a decision of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9 th resolution).\n\nThe amount paid by the Company, in 2020 for that fiscal year, to the third party responsible for managing the aforementioned supplementary defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of Beno\u00eet Potier is stated in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 162).\n\n- \u25a0 In addition, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, sections 6 and 7 of the same Code, L'Air Liquide S.A. set up a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of the senior executives, defined by reference to a collective bargaining agreement coefficient, and of corporate officers who have at least one year's length of service.\n\nSince 2015, Beno\u00eet Potier no longer benefits from this defined contribution pension plan set up for the benefit of the senior executives, the contribution paid for his benefit having been transferred to the life insurance plan (see below).\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier's pension entitlements under this plan:\n\n- - may be applied for, at the earliest, when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme;\n- - were financed by annual contributions paid in their entirety by the Company. These contributions were last set at 2.5% of the portion of remuneration that is lower than eight times the PASS. Furthermore, they were subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid pursuant to the defined contribution pension plan set up for the benefit of all the staff (see above);\n- - are estimated, as at December 31, 2020, at 190,119 euros gross per year.",

Life insurance plan\n\nAs the Executive Officers are no longer beneficiaries of the defined contribution pension plan for senior executives (see above), L'Air Liquide S.A. has entered into a collective life insurance contract which enables them to create savings which are available at any time.\n\nThe insurance contract provides that the beneficiaries can ask for the payment of a single capital sum or conversion of the capital into a life annuity.\n\nIn the event of a conversion of the capital into a life annuity, Beno\u00eet Potier's rights under this plan:\n\n- \u25a0 are estimated, as at December 31, 2020, at 71,182 euros gross per year;\n- \u25a0 are, or were, financed by contributions paid by the Company to an insurance body and which concern the brackets of remuneration ranging from 0 to 24 times the PASS.\n\nThe opening of this plan, for the third bracket (16 to 24 times the PASS) and then the second bracket (8 to 16 times the PASS), and finally its extension to the first bracket (0 to 8 times the PASS) of the Reference Remuneration, at an unchanged cost for the Company, responded to a concern for good management. The contributions paid by the Company to the third-party plan manager are assessed on the basis of the portions of the Reference Remuneration of the beneficiaries corresponding to each of the three brackets, in accordance with conditions identical to those of the previous plan.\n\nThese contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nFor Beno\u00eet Potier, the signature of this contract, for the third and then the second bracket, was authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution (7 th resolution). The extension of the plan to the first bracket concerning the band of Reference Remuneration amounting to between 0 and 8 times the annual social security ceiling was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Beno\u00eet Potier (7 th resolution).\n\nThe amount paid by the Company in 2020 for fiscal year 2019 to the insurance body pursuant to the life insurance plan for the benefit of Beno\u00eet Potier is disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 162). The amount which will be paid in 2021 in respect of 2020 is also stated in these notes.\n\n## B. Death and disability benefits plan\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier benefits from the additional 'incapacity, disability, death' benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the corporate officers who are duly authorized to benefit from such plan, which provides in particular for:\n\n- \u25a0 the grant to the beneficiaries:\n- - of additional daily indemnities in the event of incapacity and a disability annuity set, all benefits combined, at a maximum annual amount of 460,723 euros, and\n- - of a death benefit, the maximum amount of which is set at 120 times the PASS in the event of an accident.\n\nThe life insurance contract entered into with the insurer specifies the limits of the incapacity/disability and death benefits for the same insured party;\n\n- \u25a0 the payment in full, by the Company, of the contributions calculated as a percentage of the Reference Remuneration which is capped at:\n- - 16 times the PASS for the incapacity and disability cover, and\n- - 24 times the PASS for the death cover.\n\nThe contribution rate amounts to 0.85% of the Reference Remuneration up to 16 PASS and to 0.65% between 16 and 24 PASS. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of an amount equal to the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS.\n\nThe individual application to Beno\u00eet Potier of this unified benefit plan covering all the personnel, in respect of his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution (7 th resolution).\n\nThe amount of the contribution paid in 2020 for that fiscal year by L'Air Liquide S.A. in respect of the death and disability benefits plan for the benefit of Beno\u00eet Potier, is disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 162).\n\n## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers",

Termination indemnity\n\nThe main terms of the termination indemnity applicable to Beno\u00eet Potier are:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Beno\u00eet Potier from his terms of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of gross fixed and variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Beno\u00eet Potier, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company's articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity:\n\nPayment of the termination indemnity concerning Beno\u00eet Potier is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary's performance assessed in light of the Company's performance, defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed using the net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place will be calculated.\n\nGiven the fundamental importance, in the highly capital-intensive industrial gas industry, of the management and control of investment processes, this gap makes it possible to measure the regular creation of value over the three years prior to the departure.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table set forth below, with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average over three years of the annual (ROCE - WACC) gaps in bps  (a)   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                     | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                     | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                     | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0%                            |\n\n(a)  bps: basis points.\n\nThe decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 (a) relating to this indemnity was made in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure and published on the Company's website on February 16, 2018.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not receive any remuneration pursuant to article L. 225-45 paragraph 1 in respect of his office as Director so long as he performs executive duties at L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\nWithin the scope of the agreement entered into with the various stakeholders and pursuant to the provisions in force at the Group, which apply to all employees who serve on the Boards of Directors of Group companies, it was agreed that the employee Director would not receive any remuneration for his office as Director (a) .\n\n## 3.2. CRITERIA\n\nThe maximum amount of the sum to be allocated in total to the members of the Board of Directors was set by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020 at 1.3 million euros per fiscal year (12 th resolution).\n\nAs per the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, the formula for allocating Directors' remuneration seeks to ensure pay is competitive with international peers to attract the best and most suitable talent and expertise, in accordance with the Group's diversity policy.\n\nIt comprises fixed remuneration and variable remuneration based on lump-sum amounts per meeting, thereby taking into account the actual participation of each Director in the work of the Board and its Committees/working group, as well as a fixed amount per trip for Directors traveling from abroad. The variable remuneration for participation at the Board and Committee meetings is more important than the fixed remuneration.\n\nThe amounts decided for 2020 break down as:\n\n## 3.2.1. Fixed remuneration (for an entire fiscal year)\n\n- \u25a0 Each member receives fixed annual remuneration set at 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Chairman of the Audit and Accounts Committee receives additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Chairmen of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Environment and Society Committee receive additional fixed annual remuneration of 10,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Lead Director receives additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.\n\n## 3.2.2. Variable remuneration\n\nAttendance at the various meetings is remunerated as follows:\n\n- n a meeting of the Board of Directors\n\n5,500 euros\n\n- n a meeting of the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\n4,500 euros\n\n- n a meeting of the Appointments and Governance Committee\n\n3,500 euros\n\n- n a meeting of the Remuneration Committee\n\n3,500 euros\n\n- n a meeting of the Environment and Society Committee\n\n3,500 euros\n\n- n a joint session of the Audit Committee and the Environment and Society Committee\n\n3,500 euros\n\n- n a meeting of the Shareholder Relations Working Group\n\n3,000 euros\n\n- n one trip for a non-resident:\n- - in Europe\n\n3,000 euros\n\n- - Intercontinental\n\n6,000 euros\n\nTravel expenses incurred by non-French residents at the time of their trips to meetings are reimbursed by the Company.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided to amend the remuneration policy to be put to the General Meeting of May 4, 2021 to allocate the same remuneration for remote participation at meetings as for in-person attendance (instead of half the flat fee for each meeting). Measures introduced to contain the spread of coronavirus curbed in-person attendance at Board and Committee meetings in 2020, with many foreign Directors unable to attend meetings since March 2020. Some meetings were even fully remote to comply with lockdown restrictions and guarantee safety with regard to health. However, the Board notes that members were able to attend meetings using high-quality video-conferencing facilities and take part in discussions, in as smooth and efficient conditions as if they were there in person. Subject to approval of the remuneration policy for the Directors by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, this change will be effective for all meetings held since September 2020. While it does not alter the preference of the Board and its members to attend meetings in person where possible , it recognizes the advances in communication technologies. Remuneration in respect of 2020 presented in the table above (\u00a7 3.1) includes this change. However, payment of the additional amounts is subject to approval of the remuneration policy for Directors by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021 (13 th resolution).",

Revenue has been gradually recovering since the third quarter of 2020, and is thus almost stable as compared to 2019 on a comparable basis. Recurring net profit (Group share) excluding foreign exchange impact is in turn increasing by more than 4% compared with 2019. Concerning the Executive Officer's remuneration, the quantifiable criteria objectives for 2020 (increase in recurring EPS excluding foreign exchange impact and comparable growth in consolidated revenue), set by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2020, i.e. before the development of the pandemic and the unprecedented crisis which followed, could not, for obvious reasons, be fully achieved, which results in a reduction in Beno\u00eet Potier's variable remuneration compared with 2019. The Board of Directors has, however, decided, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, not to adjust the financial criteria objectives during the course of the year, so that the level of the Executive Officer's variable remuneration reflects the true economic situation.\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration is below target and amounts to 1,459,719 euros, down by -29.3% as compared to the variable remuneration for 2019.\n\nThe amount of the variable remuneration relating to the financial criteria is as follows:\n\n- n Recurring EPS: 66% of the fixed remuneration, representing 88% of the target remuneration for this criterion,\n- n Revenue: no variable remuneration will be paid for this criterion.\n\nThe amount of the variable remuneration relating to the qualitative criteria is as follows:\n\n- n CSR: 14% of the fixed remuneration, representing 95% of the target remuneration for this criterion,\n- n Organization/Human Resources: 15% of the fixed remuneration, representing 100% of the target remuneration for this criterion,\n- n Individual performance: 15% of the fixed remuneration, representing 100% of the target remuneration for this criterion.\n\nThe amount of the variable remuneration relating to the personal objectives is thus 44% of the fixed remuneration, representing 98.3% of the target remuneration for the personal objectives. The Board of Directors noted the following elements:\n\n## CSR :\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\n- \u25a0 Continue the roll-out of the Sustainable Development strategy:\n\nImplementation of the Group's Climate objectives: The Environment and Society Committee met on three occasions in 2020. It reviewed the governance put in place to monitor and advance the roll-out of the Climate Objectives announced by the Group at the end of 2018, together with the environmental and societal risks and the Vigilance Plan.\n\nConcerning the achievement of the climate Objectives, and in particular the 30% reduction in the Group's Carbon Intensity between 2015 and 2025, this reduction continued in 2020. All country groups (industrial clusters) have drawn up their Climate roadmap up until 2025, with a detailed action plan for each of the three topics: Assets/Customers/Ecosystems.\n\nIn each of these groups of countries (clusters), a Climate Champion is responsible for coordinating this matter and volunteer Climate Ambassadors carry out local initiatives and share good practices.\n\nThe Group has reinforced its strategic analysis on energy transition and launched a review of its climate objectives, which will be communicated on March 23, 2021 at a Sustainable Development Day.\n\nConcerning the Group's financing, a one-year extension option was exercised, on November 6, 2020, with regard to the syndicated credit facility for an unchanged amount of 2.5 billion euros and with a maturity of December 2025. Since 2019, this facility provides for a correlation mechanism between its financial costs and three CSR objectives in the areas of carbon intensity, gender diversity, and safety.\n\nContribution to the development of the Hydrogen Ecosystem: Beno\u00eet Potier is co-Chair of the Hydrogen Council. This Council, formed in 2017, brings together over 100 leaders in the energy, transport and industry sectors in order to promote hydrogen with a view to achieving climate change objectives. At the annual meeting in January 2020 in Versailles, the chairmen and chief executive officers presented the results of the latest report: 'Path to Hydrogen Competitiveness: A Cost Perspective' which shows that the cost of hydrogen solutions should fall more rapidly than previously expected. Hydrogen is now recognized as a key element for a low-carbon future.\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier was also involved in setting up the French National Hydrogen Council, made up of around fifteen French industrialists, tasked with contributing to the roll-out of carbon-free hydrogen in France, the creation of which was announced by the government in September 2020. He was appointed co-chair thereof on January 11, 2021.\n\n## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers",

In this regard, he submitted the panel's report to the government on February 7, 2020, which proposes to select 22 key markets, including 10 priority markets, of which hydrogen is one.\n\nIn September 2020, an in-depth session of the Board of Directors was organized on Hydrogen and energy transition, with the intervention of some high-profile personalities from outside the Company and from members of the management and operations teams. In December 2020, Air Liquide, in the presence of Beno\u00eet Potier and with the participation of Bertrand Piccard, Initiator and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, organized the 'Hydrogen Generation' digital event, in partnership with the Les Echos - Le Parisien group and Usbek & Rica, concerning the role of hydrogen in energy transition.\n\nAir Liquide Foundation: The covid-19 pandemic has made strong demands on the Foundation partners, research teams and NGOs, in France and abroad. The Foundation has been able to react quickly to this crisis thanks to its founders, L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Liquide Sant\u00e9 International (exceptional support of more than 2 millions euros, a significant portion of which has already been committed in 2020), to its Board of Directors, its partners and its network of Group employees.\n\nThe Foundation's covid-19 initiative aims at allowing understanding the effect of the coronavirus on the respiratory system (10 research projects) and at addressing emergency humanitarian needs (23 projects supported in France and abroad). One-third of the NGOs involved are new partners for the Foundation, introduced by Group employees during this crisis.\n\nIn total, the Foundation has approved in 2020 a record of 69 projects over the year, notably in the scientific field, and promoting professional integration, education and disability, both in France and abroad.\n\nIn a survey of individual shareholders of Air Liquide, which collected over 6,000 responses, the shareholders expressed strong support for the work of the Foundation.\n\n- \u25a0 Safety and reliability: based on the estimated hours worked, the lost-time accident frequency rate of Group employees stood at 0.9 in 2020, compared to 1.2 in 2019 and 1.3 in 2018. This is the Group's best performance since the introduction of this indicator.\n- However, 2020 was marked by the deaths of 2 employees and of a subcontracted driver. In 2020, road safety formed part of a consolidated action plan aimed at raising awareness of all persons affected and at introducing technical assistance tools in vehicles, as commenced a few years ago and continued in 2020 despite the public health crisis. Concerning industrial safety / reliability, the Group's IMS (Industrial Management System) program set up 15 years ago has helped improve the management of industrial risks. The new IMS reference system was rolled out to around two-thirds of the clusters, the end of the roll-out to the remaining third being envisaged in mid-2022 due to the sanitary crisis.\n\nIn 2020, in terms of process safety, a plan to upgrade safety of the production sites has been rolled out and should be finalized by the end of 2021. The Board also noted the leading role of Air Liquide notably in developing harmonized international standards.\n\n## Organization/Human Resources:\n\nPerformance was considered excellent. In this context of a public health crisis, very particular attention has been paid to employee health since the start of the covid-19 crisis. Capitalizing on its international presence and its network organization, the Group set up a crisis unit, in February 2020, headed by the Director of Human Resources who reports to the Executive Committee. Accordingly, the experience of the Chinese subsidiaries was immediately put to good use.\n\nPsychological support, as well as proximity and communication with management have been strengthened. Special attention has been paid to employee commitment. A first worldwide survey, MyVoice, was launched as planned and specific questions have made it possible to monitor as closely as possible the feedback on the crisis. The roll-out of the 'BeActEngage' leadership program proceeded as planned, permitting regular exchanges, although all the workshops were conducted online.\n\nAn initial assessment of the crisis has been made and international teams have worked on four areas (teleworking, managerial support, relations with our customers and patients, and office design) to capitalize on the experience gained and accelerate our transformations.",

Since continuity is key, the Group is pursuing its  talent development  policy. Despite the  circumstances, regular reviews of talent and their development have been conducted online,  at the level of operating clusters and up to Executive Committee level. Regular reviews of the  most promising talent  have taken place with the Appointments and Governance Committee. Good progress continued to be made with the implementation of the inclusion and  diversity |\n| policy within all Group entities. A 'diversity lab' was conducted with international HR leaders  and managers to analyze all processes and practices, identify potential biases and implement  corrective measures ('nudges') to limit those biases. Accordingly, as part of the regular reviews  of talent with the highest potential, the diversity of profiles is taken into account, with the aim of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |",

They are calculated:\n\n- (i)   for 50% of the performance shares granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax ( 'ROCE (c) ' ) recorded at the end of the 2022 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective has been set within the trajectory of the NEOS company program which aimed at a ROCE of more than 10% in 2021-2022;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years ( 'AL TSR' ). The objective of an absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit,\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): of the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends - sourced from Bloomberg ('B TSR'), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg) for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years,\n\nThe rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least 2% higher than the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible;\n\n- (iii) for 10% of the performance shares granted, on the reduction in Air Liquide's carbon intensity, defined as the following ratio, recorded as at December 31, 2022: Greenhouse gas emissions of the Air Liquide Group for 2022 in kg-equivalent CO2/2022 EBITDA (calculated at constant exchange rate on the basis of the 2015 foreign exchange rates) expressed in euros. For the purposes of this policy, greenhouse gas emissions include direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe objective was determined within the trajectory of the Group's Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018 which aim to reduce the carbon intensity by 30% between 2015 and 2025.\n\nStock options, performance shares or any other long-term incentive",

This amount will be paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThe performance conditions that apply are similar to those that applied to the defined benefit plan: the total contribution for a fiscal year depends on the average annual difference between the return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC is measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps is calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract is determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC)  over three years in bps  (a)   | Performance coefficient applied to the  nominal amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                    | 100%                                                     |\n| 250                                                                      | 66%                                                      |\n| 200                                                                      | 50%                                                      |\n| 100                                                                      | 25%                                                      |\n| < 100                                                                    | 0%                                                       |\n\n(a)  bps: basis points.\n\nIn respect of 2020, the Board meeting on February 9, 2021 took note of the 100% achievement of the performance conditions. Accordingly, the amount to be paid in 2021 in respect of 2020 under the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription will amount to 340,000 euros gross (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\n## Pension commitment pursuant to a defined contribution pension plan\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier benefits from the defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and the Executive Officers, the contribution to which is paid in equal shares by the employer and the beneficiary on the remuneration which does not exceed eight times the PASS. The application of this plan to Beno\u00eet Potier was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010 and approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9 th resolution).\n\nThe amount of the contributions paid in 2020 (for that fiscal year) under the supplementary defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of Beno\u00eet Potier amounts to 9,836 euros.\n\nSupplementary pension plans",

Remuneration policy applicable to corporate officers\n\n(submitted for the approval of the General Meeting pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code)\n\nIn accordance with article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, the remuneration policy applicable to the corporate officers of L'Air Liquide S.A. described in this section is submitted for approval by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021 in the 12 th resolution for the Executive Officers (\u00a75.1 below) and the 13 th resolution for the Directors (\u00a75.2 below).\n\n## 5.1. REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nThis remuneration policy for Executive Officers was drawn up by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021, upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee which had carried out in-depth analyses on the subject on which it reported to the Board of Directors. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not attend deliberations by the Remuneration Committee relating to his personal case and does not take part in deliberations or votes by the Board of Directors on the remuneration components that concern him. The decision-making process followed to determine the policy is also applicable when said policy is reviewed and implemented.\n\n## The principles and structure of the remuneration policy are in line with the policy approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020.\n\nTo determine the remuneration policy, the Board of Directors takes into account the principles of completeness, balance, comparability, consistency, comprehensibility and proportionality as recommended by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance.\n\n## 5.1.1. General principles\n\nThe elements compromising the remuneration for the Executive Officers are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an annual short-term component, comprising a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 a long-term incentive (hereafter 'LTI') through the grant of share subscription options and/or performance shares, both tools being subject in full to the same performance conditions calculated over three years;\n- \u25a0 other benefits attached to the performance of the Executive Officer's term of office, including:\n- - a supplementary pension mechanism (a) , comprising specifically for Beno\u00eet Potier, since January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract subject to performance conditions, which from this date has replaced the defined benefit pension plan which applies to eligible employee senior executives and Executive Officers and is applicable for the period up to December 31, 2019,\n- - a collective life insurance plan,\n- - a death and disability benefits plan,\n- - commitments to pay an indemnity in the event of the termination of duties at the Company's initiative, in certain circumstances, subject to performance conditions calculated over a three-year period,\n- - entitlement to unemployment insurance for Company managers and corporate officers, in the absence of an employment contract with the Group.\n\nThe remuneration policy reflects the level of responsibility of the Group's senior executives and is adapted to the Group's context, remains competitive and is an incentive to promote the Group's performance over the medium to long-term, in compliance with the Company's interests and the interests of all the stakeholders.\n\nThis remuneration policy, which is applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, applies whether the Group's senior Executive Officer acts as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or, if circumstances so require, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In such circumstances, a Chairman who does not also have the duties of Chief Executive Officer would receive fixed remuneration to the exclusion of any variable remuneration.\n\nThere are no employment contracts between the Executive Officer and any of the Group's companies (b) .\n\nFurthermore, if such a situation were to arise, the remuneration policy applicable to a Senior Executive Vice President would be determined on the basis of the policy applicable to a Chief Executive Officer of the Company, after taking account, however, of the difference in the level of responsibility, consistent with the earlier practices applied at the Company for this type of Executive Officer.\n\n## 5.1.2. Structure of the total remuneration for the Executive Officers\n\nThe structure and principles applicable to the remuneration are in line with previous fiscal years .\n\n- \u25a0 The remuneration policy provides for a proportionate balance between the three components of the total annual remuneration (i.e. the fixed remuneration, the variable remuneration and the long-term incentives, comprising performance shares and/or stock options).\n\nThe fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration 35% and the LTI 40% of the total annual remuneration. The components which are subject to performance conditions therefore represent 75% of this total remuneration. The collective pension insurance contract and the termination indemnity are also subject to performance conditions.\n\nThe variable part continues to be expressed as a target variable remuneration (as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) with a maximum. The total target variable remuneration which is determined represents approximately 90% of the total maximum variable remuneration, for a very good performance. Consequently, for a fixed remuneration of 100, the target is 150% and the maximum is 167%.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nConcerning the weighting of the various criteria adopted (see table below):\n\n- - A greater relative weight is still given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria.\n- -Quantifiable criteria: as before, each quantifiable criterion is assigned a target weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) corresponding to a 100% achievement of the target objective set at the beginning of the year, and a maximum weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration).\n- -Qualitative criteria:\n- - a weighting is allocated to each of the qualitative criteria;\n- - the qualitative criteria continue to be based, as to two-thirds, on three to four categories or sub-categories of objectives which are defined each year and, as to one-third, on an assessment of the individual performance.\n- - The target weighting and the maximum weighting are made public ex ante; the actual weight of each criterion for the determination of the variable remuneration due in respect of the fiscal year will be established on the basis of the performance measured for each criterion in light of the target objective, on the basis of the application of a formula for the financial criteria and the assessment of the Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee for the qualitative criteria. The rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration for this criterion, will be made public ex post.\n- \u25a0 The performance conditions reflect the Company's strategy. For 2021 , they were set in the trajectory of the principal objectives of the NEOS company program incorporating notably sales growth and the ROCE.\n\nAccordingly, the quantifiable components of the annual variable remuneration include a criterion of an increase in the recurring EPS which makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of an increase in sales in turn reflects the momentum of the activity. The two criteria, growth in revenue and the recurring EPS reflect the Group's ambition to achieve profitable growth. Moreover, the efficiency objectives that were reevaluated in 2019 compared to the initial NEOS objective contribute to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nThe LTI performance conditions in turn incorporate the ROCE, which makes it possible to measure the Return on Capital Employed and is relevant in a highly capital-intensive industry.\n\nThe Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in turn makes it possible to align the Company's performance with the regular profits expected by its shareholders. Moreover, consistent with the Group's responsible growth approach, the LTI plans incorporate with effect from 2020 a performance condition linked to the Group's Carbon Intensity (see definition below). The objective of this condition is consistent with the trajectory of the Group's Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018 and which aim to reduce the Carbon Intensity by 30% between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe performance conditions which apply to the termination indemnity and the collective pension insurance contract are based on the gap between the ROCE and the WACC (average gap over three years) which makes it possible to measure the regular value creation given the fundamental importance, in the highly capital-intensive industrial gas industry, of the management and control of investment processes.\n\nThe qualitative components of the annual variable remuneration incorporate the pursuit over the long-term of objectives related to safety , sustainable development, Human Resources and the preparation of the succession plans, thus supporting the Company's sustainability .\n\nThese incentive elements thus reflect the Group's strategy which is steered toward profitable long-term growth, while acting responsibly with regard to all stakeholders. In a highly capital-intensive industry, profitable long-term growth requires constant attention to be paid to each investment decision and to the competitiveness of every transaction, while maintaining an ongoing effort over time in favor, in particular, of safety and security, innovation, employee training and development, together with the environment.\n\nThe selection of the components for the remuneration of the Executive Officers by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee is made by taking into account the conditions of remuneration and employment of the Company's employees. Accordingly, the quantifiable and qualitative components of the variable remuneration for the Company's Executive Officers and senior executives are identical. These objectives are also reflected in those for the Company's employees who have a short-term variable remuneration. Moreover, the LTI performance conditions are identical for all the employee beneficiaries (for the record, approximately 1,800 Group employees each year) and for the Executive Officers. These alignments provide for greater coherence of efforts in achieving the Company's performance objectives. The importance given to the safety objectives helps implement a high-quality working environment for the employees that has a direct impact on their engagement and performance. The variable remuneration also incorporates objectives of talent development, the achievement of which requires in particular the implementation of varied, relevant programs for the training and development of employees throughout their career.\n\n- \u25a0 The defined contribution pension plan applicable to all employees and Executive Officers is being transferred on a collective basis to a mandatory company retirement savings plan ('PERO') on January 1, 2021 to bring it into line with the new legal and regulatory framework arising from the PACTE Law (see details below).\n- \u25a0 The other principles which apply to the LTI are unchanged (the proration of the LTI in the event of the Executive Officer's departure from the Group during the period of assessment of the performance conditions, the level of requirement of the objectives and the rules which are specific to the Executive Officers as described below, the limits on grants).",

Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed remuneration is determined on the basis of the level of responsibility, the experience in the executive management duties and market practices.\n\nFixed remuneration will represent approximately 25% of the total target annual remuneration and, as per the above-mentioned principles, will amount for Beno\u00eet Potier to roughly 1,325,000 euros (unchanged since 2018).\n\n## B. Variable remuneration\n\nThe variable remuneration will be based on:\n\n- \u25a0 two quantifiable financial criteria, which were already included in the criteria for the variable remuneration for 2020:\n- - increase in the recurring net earnings (excluding exceptional and significant transactions which do not impact the operating income recurring) excluding currency impact, per share (hereinafter 'recurring EPS' ),\n- - comparable growth in consolidated revenue (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of currency and energy).\n\nThe weighting of each criterion is shown in the table below.\n\nFor each criterion, the Board of Directors has defined a target objective, which is not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nonetheless, the rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to that criterion, will be made public ex post.\n\nFor each financial criterion, a formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set, the value of the variable part is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero ;\n\n- \u25a0 qualitative personal criteria, a weighting being allocated to each of them. They are detailed in the table below and relate:\n- - as to one-third, to Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter 'CSR'),\n- - as to one-third, to organization and to Human Resources,\n- - as to one-third, to individual performance. This criterion responds to the Board of Directors' desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2021 fiscal year will be paid in 2020, after approval of the financial statements by the General Meeting, it being noted that its payment is conditional on approval by an Ordinary General Meeting of the elements of the Executive Officer's remuneration, under the conditions provided for in article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## C. Other elements of annual remuneration\n\nThe benefits in kind include the use of a Company car as well as contributions to the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers. By way of information, these benefits traditionally amount to around 10,000 euros.\n\nIn accordance with the Group's internal practice, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, like any other Executive Officer, does not receive any remuneration in respect of his office as Director, if he holds executive duties at L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## D. Long-term remuneration components\n\n## 1. Principles of grant\n\n- \u25a0 In accordance with the principle that has been adopted since 2016, the Board confirmed that the award of LTI to the Executive Officer and the changes therein over time will be assessed in terms of the IFRS value (and not in terms of the volumes granted), for all stock option and performance share plans combined.\n- For 2021, the Board of Directors intends to grant LTIs to Beno\u00eet Potier representing an IFRS value of approximately 2.25 million euros, which is stable by comparison with the grants since 2018, representing 40.4% of the total target remuneration for 2021, in accordance with the weighting defined above.\n- \u25a0 All the LTI granted are subject to performance conditions calculated over a period of three years. The performance conditions, which apply to the plans decided upon in the autumn, are set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n- On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board has retained the ROCE, total shareholder return (AL TSR and relative TSR) and Group carbon intensity criteria.\n- \u25a0 For each performance condition, a formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to determine, following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved, the percentage of performance shares definitively awarded/stock options that can be exercised.\n- The demanding objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex post, at the end of the Board meeting in the month of February following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of LTI definitively awarded/that can be exercised are also published at the end of this Board meeting.\n- \u25a0 For the Executive Officers who are beneficiaries of the 'France' performance share Plan, the vesting period is three years from the meeting of the Board of Directors which decided upon their grant. This period, at the end of which the performance shares vest, is followed by a two-year holding period. The stock options are in principle subject to a four-year lock-up period, followed by a six-year exercise period.\n\n## 2. Performance conditions\n\nAs a consequence of the above, the performance conditions which apply to all the beneficiaries of the LTI Plans which will be allocated in 2021 have been determined by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021. The number of LTI that will be definitively awarded/can be exercised pursuant to the 2021 Plans will depend:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the LTI granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax ( 'ROCE (a) ' ) recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100%, and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no grant. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective has been in the trajectory of the ROCE target announced by the Company that is maintained at more than 10% though in 2023-2024, which reflects the impact of the crisis but also a pro-active investment policy in a context of numerous and qualitative opportunities;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the LTI granted:\n\n- - for 50% of the LTI referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 ( 'AL TSR' ). The objective of an absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit,\n- - for 50% of the LTI referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends - sourced from Bloomberg ( 'B TSR' ), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg), for fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least 2% higher than the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible;\n\n- (a)  For the purposes hereof, the Return on Capital Employed after tax ('ROCE') will be calculated as follows: ((Net profit after tax before deduction of minority interests - cost of net debt after taxes) for the period 2023) / (weighted average of (shareholders' equity + minority interests + net debt) at the end of the last three half years (H2 2023, H1 2023, H2 2022)).",

For the purposes of this policy, greenhouse gas emissions include direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2). The objective was determined within the trajectory of the Group's Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018 which aim to reduce the Carbon Intensity by 30% between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded by the Board at the time when the financial statements are adopted for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n## 3. Rules specific to the Executive Officers\n\nThe grant to the Executive Officers is examined by the Remuneration Committee at the same time as the allocation to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors. It is made within the scope of plans, adopted at pre-established periods in the autumn, in the form of performance shares and/or share subscription options granted without any discount.\n\nThe grant of LTI is examined in light of the total amount of the Executive Officer's annual remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the shareholders are respected.\n\n## Limits on the grants to Executive Officers\n\nWithin the scope of the sub-limits authorized by the General Meeting (a) , the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage of the share capital and for each Executive Officer (ii) as a multiple of their remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code. Accordingly, the total aggregate IFRS value of the LTI granted cannot exceed 1.5 times the amount of the Executive Officer's maximum gross annual remuneration, it being noted moreover that, in accordance with the remuneration policy referred to above, the grant of LTI represents approximately 40% of the Executive Officer's total annual remuneration.\n\n## Shareholding and share ownership obligations\n\n## Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code\n\nOn the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board defined the shareholding obligations resulting from articles L. 225-185 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code applicable to the shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and performance shares respectively as from September 28, 2015. They lead to the obligation, for the Executive Officer, to hold, in registered form, until the termination of his duties, a minimum quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock options/each definitive award of performance shares.\n\nThis percentage will be lowered to 5%, as soon as the quantity of shares held by the Executive Officer represents an amount equal to at least three times the Executive Officer's gross annual fixed remuneration.\n\n## Additional shareholding obligation - Recommendation made by the AFEP/MEDEF Code\n\nIn addition, the internal rule defined by the Board of Directors since 2008, pursuant to which the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer must hold in a registered share account a number of shares equivalent to twice his gross annual fixed remuneration (one time the annual fixed remuneration for a Senior Executive Vice President) remains in effect. This obligation will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the aforementioned rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year.\n\n## Other rules applicable to the Executive Officer\n\n- \u25a0 Condition of presence: loss of the stock options/rights to the performance shares in the process of being acquired, in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause.\n- \u25a0 Principle of a proration on the basis of the actual presence of the Executive Officer: in the event of a departure from the Group of an Executive Officer for a reason other than resignation or removal from office for serious cause (b) , the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) will be reduced on a prorated basis to the number of months' actual presence of the Executive Officer at the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria. In addition, no grant will be made to an Executive Officer at the time of this departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n- The Executive Officer will remain subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating to the duration of the vesting, lock-up and holding periods in respect of the shares and stock options granted.\n- \u25a0 Obligation regarding the restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication of the financial statements. These abstention periods open 30 days before the announcement of the annual and half-yearly consolidated results and 15 calendar days before publication of the quarterly financial information. They end on the date of publication of the information at close of business.\n- \u25a0 Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning stock options/shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and concerning the performance shares awarded, throughout the length of their term of office.\n- (a)  Lastly the Combined General Meeting on May 7, 2019 (13 th and 14 th resolutions).\n- (b)  Situations which will result in the loss of the LTI.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n## E. Long-term commitments and commitments relating to termination of duties\n\nThe Board of Directors takes into account, in the overall assessment and determination of the Executive Officers' remuneration, the other commitments relating to the elements of remuneration described below, some of which have been submitted for the approval of the General Meeting within the scope of the regulated agreements and commitments procedure (a) .\n\nAt the Company, the long-term commitments and commitments relating to termination of duties for the Executive Officers are usually as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 a supplementary pension mechanism (b) , comprising specifically for Beno\u00eet Potier, from January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract subject to performance conditions, which from this date has replaced the defined benefit pension plan which applies to eligible employee senior executives and Executive Officers and is applicable for the period up to December 31, 2019;\n- \u25a0 a collective life insurance plan;\n- \u25a0 a death and disability benefits plan;\n- \u25a0 commitments to pay an indemnity in the event of the termination of duties at the Company's initiative, in certain circumstances, subject to performance conditions calculated over a three-year period;\n- \u25a0 entitlement to unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers, in the absence of an employment contract with the Group.\n\nIn the case of Beno\u00eet Potier, these commitments are as follows:\n\n## 1. Long-term commitments\n\n## The Company's pension obligations\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier has been authorized to benefit from various supplementary social protection schemes set up by L'Air Liquide S.A., as follows: Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\nPursuant to the PACTE Law and Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019, the supplementary pension plans which make the vesting of rights conditional upon the beneficiaries' presence at the Company at the time of retirement can no longer grant a right to acquire supplementary conditional rights as from January 1, 2020. For the period up until this date, Beno\u00eet Potier's rights under the defined benefit pension plan ('Plan S') will remain subject in their entirety to the pension plan regulations.\n\nSince January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription replaces the acquisition of rights under the defined benefit pension plan. Pursuant to the PACTE Law and Ordinance No. 2019-1234 of November 27, 2019, implementation of this new system for the benefit of Beno\u00eet Potier was approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020 pursuant to the remuneration policy (11 th resolution).\n\nIn this mechanism, the amount paid by the Company will be split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount shall be paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office.\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThis scheme is specific to Beno\u00eet Potier and tailored to his individual situation in light of his seniority and the fact that the scheme is only intended to apply up until the end of his career as an Executive Officer. It is without prejudice to the mechanism which would apply in the future to a new Executive Officer.\n\nThe scheme was selected from among several alternatives and represents the lowest cost for the Company, being over 20% less than that of the previous plan. For Beno\u00eet Potier, it simply supplements the rights accumulated under the defined benefit pension plan and makes it possible to maintain rights which are equivalent to those which would have existed under such plan, if it had been possible to maintain them for Beno\u00eet Potier. Although, pursuant to the new legislation, this pension insurance contract is not subject to a condition of the beneficiary's presence at the Company at the end of his career, in any event, with regard to Beno\u00eet Potier, the application of this condition under the defined benefit pension plan has become very theoretical: a beneficiary who is over 55 years of age and has at least five years' length of service (which is the case for Beno\u00eet Potier) shall retain his rights, even if his term of office is terminated provided that he does not resume any professional activity before his retirement. Consequently, the fact that this condition does not apply to the new mechanism is neutral in this specific situation.\n\nThe gross annual contribution amounts to approximately 10% of the annual target fixed and variable remuneration for 2020, subject to the achievement of similar performance conditions to those which apply to the defined benefit pension plan, which had been determined by the Board of Directors and approved by the General Meeting of May 16, 2018 in its 10 th resolution. Consequently, the amount of contributions for a fiscal year will depend on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax ( ROCE ) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital ( WACC ) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps will be calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.",

For information purposes, contributions paid in 2020 by the Company for Beno\u00eet Potier totaled 9,836 euros.\n\nNote that in order to bring it into line with the new legal and regulatory plan arising from the PACTE Law (a) , this retirement plan is being transferred collectively to a mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO) on January 1, 2021. As Beno\u00eet Potier is covered by this collective plan, his entitlements are also transferred to the PERO on this date. As for the defined contribution plan, the employer and beneficiaries pay equal contributions into the mandatory company retirement plan on remuneration up to a limit of eight times the PASS.\n\nIndividual application of the defined contribution plan to Beno\u00eet Potier was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9 th resolution).\n\n## Other benefits\n\n## Life insurance plan\n\nAs Beno\u00eet Potier is no longer a beneficiary of the defined contribution pension plan for employee senior executives, a collective life insurance contract was entered into which enables them to create savings on behalf of the beneficiary which are available at any time.\n\nThe contract provides that the beneficiaries can request the payment of a single capital sum or the conversion of the capital into a life annuity.\n\nThe Executive Officer's rights under this plan are financed by contributions paid by the Company to an insurance body and concern the brackets of remuneration ranging from 0 to 24 times the PASS.\n\nThe opening of this plan, for the third bracket (16 to 24 times PASS) and then the second bracket (8 to 16 times PASS), and finally its extension to the first bracket (0 to 8 times PASS) of the Reference Remuneration, at an unchanged cost for the Company, responded to a concern for good management. The contributions paid to the third-party plan manager are assessed on the basis of the portions of the beneficiaries' Reference Remuneration which correspond to each of the three brackets, in accordance with conditions which are identical to those of the previous plan. The contributions are reviewed each year on the basis of the amount of the PASS. For information purposes, in 2020, they amounted to 218,830 euros.\n\nFor Beno\u00eet Potier, the signature of this contract, for the third and then the second bracket, was authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution (7 th resolution). The extension of the plan to the first bracket concerning the band of Reference Remuneration amounting to between 0 and 8 times the annual social security ceiling was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Beno\u00eet Potier (7 th resolution).\n\n## Death and disability benefits plan\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier benefits from the additional 'incapacity, disability, death' benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the Executive Officers duly authorized to benefit from such plan in which the remuneration taken into account for the calculation of the contributions is capped at (i) 16 times the annual social security ceiling for the incapacity and disability cover, (ii) 24 times the annual social security ceiling for the death cover. For information purposes, contributions paid in 2020 by the Company for Beno\u00eet Potier totaled 3,357 euros.\n\nThe individual application to Beno\u00eet Potier, in respect of his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of this unified death and disability benefits plan covering all the personnel, was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Beno\u00eet Potier (7 th resolution).",

Commitments relating to termination of duties\n\n## Termination indemnities\n\nThis termination indemnity was the subject of a decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 made in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure and published on the Company's website on February 16, 2018. It was approved by the General Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a specific resolution (9 th resolution). The main terms are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Beno\u00eet Potier from his terms of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of gross fixed and variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Beno\u00eet Potier, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company's articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\nPerformance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity :\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that the payment of the termination indemnity concerning Beno\u00eet Potier is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary's performance assessed in light of the Company's performance, defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed using the net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place will be calculated.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table below, with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average over three years of the annual (ROCE - WACC) gaps in bps  (a)   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                     | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                     | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                     | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0%                            |\n\n(a)  bps: basis points.\n\n## Unemployment insurance for the company managers and corporate officers\n\nBy decision of the Board of Directors in May 2006, Beno\u00eet Potier benefits, in his capacity as Executive Officer, from the unemployment insurance for Company managers and corporate officers taken out by the Company. The contributions paid by the Company are added back to Beno\u00eet Potier's remuneration as benefits in kind (which for 2020 were 10,586 euros, for illustrative purposes).\n\nThis decision had been approved by the General Meeting on May 9, 2007, in accordance with the regulated agreements procedure (7 th resolution). The Board of Directors confirmed, at its meeting in May 2018, that Beno\u00eet Potier continues to benefit from this unemployment insurance within the scope of the latest renewal of his duties.\n\nThe commitments described above may be terminated according to common law.\n\n## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L' Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n## 5.2. REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO DIRECTORS\n\nThe remuneration policy for Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A. was drawn up by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021, upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee which had carried out in-depth analyses on the subject on which it reported to the Board of Directors. The decision-making process followed to determine the policy is also applicable when said policy is reviewed and implemented.\n\nThe principles and structure of the remuneration policy for Directors are in line with the policy approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020.\n\nThe remuneration policy for the Directors aims to determine, pursuant to the total package voted by the Ordinary General Meeting (to date, a maximum annual pay package of 1.3 million euros, in accordance with the 12 th resolution voted by the Combined General Meeting on May 5, 2020), a remuneration which is competitive internationally to attract the best skills and expertise, in compliance with the Board's diversity policy.\n\nFirst of all, it provides for fixed remuneration (prorated if the term of office commences or comes to an end during the course of the year) allocated to the Directors. This remuneration is increased for the Lead Director, and an additional fixed remuneration is allocated to the Chairs of the four Board Committees (a) , to take account of the level of responsibilities incurred and the work involved as a result of these duties.\n\nIt also includes a variable remuneration, which is the highest part, on the basis of each Director's attendance at the meetings of the Board and the Committees/working group, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code, in the form of the allocation of a fixed amount for each attendance at a meeting.\n\nThe Board will seek to harmonize fixed remuneration awarded to the Committee Chairs, since they have a comparable workload, as well as the remuneration awarded for attending each Committee meeting.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided to slightly amend the remuneration policy to be put to the General Meeting of May 4, 2021 to allocate the same remuneration for remote participation at meetings as for in-person attendance (instead of half the flat fee for each meeting). Measures introduced to contain the spread of coronavirus curbed in-person attendance at Board and Committee meetings in 2020, with many foreign Directors unable to attend meetings since March 2020. Some meetings were even fully remote to comply with lockdown restrictions and guarantee safety with regard to health. However, the Board notes that members were able to attend meetings using high-quality video-conferencing facilities and take part in discussions, in qualitative conditions equivalent to in-person meetings. Subject to approval of the remuneration policy for the Directors by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, this change will be effective for all meetings held since September 2020. While it does not alter the preference of the Board and its members to attend meetings in person where possible, it recognizes the advances in communication technologies.\n\nIn order to take account of the distance for Directors coming from abroad, a fixed amount per trip is added to the variable remuneration for such Directors if attending in person (the remuneration for intercontinental travel being higher than that provided for intracontinental travel). Travel expenses are refunded by the Company.\n\nThis policy promotes attendance and effective participation by the Directors in the work of the Board and Committees, which fosters dialog between the Directors and with the management team, and, more generally, a complete understanding by the members of the Company's activities and issues, including any social and environmental issues , which ensures solid governance for the Company's sustainability.\n\nThe recognition of the role of the Lead Director, who receives additional remuneration in this regard, reflects the importance accorded by the Group to his governance tasks assisting the combined executive management functions, in connection with the meetings of the Board and the Appointments and Governance Committee, and in an informal manner between such meetings, thus promoting best governance practices. The consideration, in the remuneration policy, of the work of the four specialist Committees is evidence of the importance accorded to the preparation of the principal Board decisions, whether in terms of the proper running of the governing bodies, the review of the financial statements and the financial situation, the risk analysis, the consideration of the societal and environmental issues across all the Group's activities, or indeed the determination of an incentivizing remuneration policy for the Executive Officers, including objectives in line with those of the Company.\n\nAccordingly, the remuneration policy, which is balanced and incentivizing, contributes to the quality of the Board's work, the latter being thus able to determine the orientations of the Company's activity and its strategy in the best interests of the Company, its employees and all the stakeholders.\n\nIt is stated that the Executive Officers do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director or as Chair of a Committee/ working group while they perform executive duties at L'Air Liquide S.A. Moreover, pursuant to the provisions in force at the Group which apply to all the employees who perform duties on the Group companies' Boards of Directors, and in agreement with the various stakeholders, the employee Directors do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director. Travel expenses are refunded by the Company.",

Allotment policy\n\nThe Company attributes annually, in principle, performance shares and/or stock options (hereinafter referred to as 'LTIs') in favor of its Executive Officers and its employees. Performance share plans for its employees have been in place since 2008, and have been open to the Executive Officers and the members of the Executive Committee since 2015.\n\nThese attributions are decided upon by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations granted by the General Meeting, and most recently by the Combined General Meeting of May 7, 2019 for a period of 38 months.\n\nSince 2019, the Board of Directors has decided to grant performance shares only (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the scheme.\n\nThe system for the LTI plans is aimed at three sets of beneficiaries:\n\n- \u25a0 the Company's Executive Officer, for whom the attribution of LTIs and changes to them over time continue to be valued in terms of the IFRS valuation (and not as attributed volumes), all stock option and performance share plans included;\n- \u25a0 the members of the Executive Committee and the Group's managers who hold positions with a high level of responsibility or who make special contributions to the Group, all of whom benefit, beginning in 2015 for the Executive Committee and 2019/2020 for the other beneficiaries, from attribution exclusively in the form of performance shares;\n- \u25a0 the specific contributors, such as those employees distinguished by the quality of their conduct in exceptional situations, the inventors and innovators, the middle managers, as well as an expanded category of new employee beneficiaries.\n\nThe criteria used to draw up the lists of the beneficiary employees reflect the jobs and the geographical areas in which the Group carries out its activities and the specific contribution, the particular potential, or indeed the individual or collective conduct of the persons concerned, which has been noted in exceptional situations. The lists of beneficiary employees are also drawn up with the desire to ensure a certain rotation and an expansion of the beneficiary population. Accordingly, around 34% of the beneficiaries of the Plans dated September 29, 2020 are employees who had not been awarded stock options/performance shares during the last five years.\n\n## ALLOTMENTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2020\n\n| Total number of performance shares   | 345,923   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| % of the share capital               | 0.07%     |\n| Number of grants  (a)                | 2,294     |\n| % of employees                       | 3.56%     |\n\nPerformance conditions apply to all the performance shares which are awarded to all the beneficiaries.

Stock option plans\n\n(Information to be regarded as the Special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article/uni00A0L. 225-184 of the French Commercial Code)\n\nPursuant to the decisions of the Board of Directors, following the authorizations of the General Meeting and on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Company has adopted plans granting a certain number of stock options to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries worldwide, including the Executive Officer.\n\nStock options are granted for a minimum price which cannot be lower than the average opening market price over the 20 trading days preceding the attribution date. The maximum exercise period is 10 years since the stock option plan dated October 14, 2011.\n\nThe stock options cannot be exercised before a minimum period of four years after they are awarded. The Board of Directors has the power to terminate this lock-in period if there is a takeover bid for the Company's shares or a merger or takeover of the Company.\n\nThe outstanding stock options thus attributed by the Board of Directors in the context of the authorizations voted by the General Meetings and which have not yet been exercised amounted, after adjustment, to 2,268,200 stock options (at an average price of 76.61 euros) as at December 31, 2020, i.e. 0.48% % of the shares which make up the capital, including 531,349 stock options (at an average price of 77.33 euros) awarded, during their term of office, to the Executive Officer present as at December 31, 2020.\n\nOf the total stock options authorized for issue by the General Meeting of May 7, 2019, there was still a potential attribution of 9,473,214 stock options as at December 31, 2020 (no stock options were attributed in 2019 and 2020, as the Board of Directors decided to only attribute performance shares).\n\nTABLE 8 -

As a result, the total proportion of stock options that may be exercised is 100% (for more details on the achievement of performance conditions, see page 170; the performance conditions are identical to the performance share plans of this same date).\n\n## 3. Performance share plans\n\n(Information to be regarded as the Special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article/uni00A0L. 225-197-4 of the French Commercial Code)\n\n## 3.1. DESCRIPTION\n\nSince 2008, performance share attributions have been designed to retain and motivate talented employees more dynamically and to reward performance over the medium term.\n\nThe Extraordinary General Meeting of May 7, 2019 authorized the Board to attribute performance shares to the Group's employees, within an upper attribution limit equal to 0.5% of the share capital over 38 months; pursuant to this upper limit, it fixed the limit on the number of shares that can be attributed to the Executive Officers over the same period, which amounts to 0.1% of the share capital.\n\nFor each attribution, the Board determines two different plan regulations (the 'France' Plan and the 'World' Plan) which govern the attribution of performance shares to the beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The 'France' and 'World' Plans mainly differ in the number of years of service required - paragraph a) below, and to the correlative absence of any holding requirement for the 'World' Plan - paragraph c) below.\n\nThe performance shares are accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 a condition of presence during the vesting period: the shares granted to a beneficiary will only be definitively acquired if they continue to be an employee or Executive Officer of a Group company during a vesting period, which is calculated from the attribution date - three years for the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan and four years for the beneficiaries of the 'World' Plan. In the event of retirement, the beneficiary retains their rights, being no longer required to satisfy the continued service requirement;\n- \u25a0 performance conditions which relate, since the first attribution in 2008, to all performance shares awarded to any beneficiary; see the performance conditions in the summary table for attribution of performance shares below;\n- \u25a0 a holding requirement: with effect from the definitive attribution date, the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan have an obligation to hold the shares for an additional two years during which the said shares cannot be transferred (other than in the event of a death or disability).\n\nTo date, the performance shares delivered have been treasury shares issued as part of the Company's buyback program (see pages 359-360).\n\nThe outstanding performance shares attributed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations voted by the General Meetings, for which the definitive attribution date has not yet occurred, amounted, after adjustment, to 1,423,078 shares as at December 31, 2020, i.e., 0.30% of the shares that make up the share capital.\n\nOut of the total performance shares whose award was authorized by the General Meeting of May 7, 2019 for 38 months, 1,673,208 performance shares remained potentially available for award as at December 31, 2020.",

Profit-sharing\n\nProfit-sharing and incentive schemes have been organized for many years in Group companies in France and paid almost 54,6 million euros for 2019 performance. This year these schemes cover over 99% of employees in France.\n\nUnder the main Company Savings Plans, Group employees in France can make payments to dedicated and diversified investment funds, managed by equal-representation supervisory boards, on a voluntary basis or based on profit-sharing, incentives and, where applicable, contributions, and thus benefit from the preferential tax regime applicable in consideration for locking-in their assets over a period of five years.\n\nIn 2020, L'Air Liquide S.A. paid 7.63 million euros to 1,166 beneficiaries in respect of profit-sharing and incentives. Company contributions to the Company Savings Plan are negotiated every year and amounted to nearly 1.01 million euros in 2020. These payments correspond to an average amount of 6,545 euros per employee excluding employer contribution.\n\nIn 2020, L'Air Liquide S.A. employees invested 90.1% of their profit-sharing and incentives in savings plans, respectively in bond-weighted assets (20%) and equity-weighted assets (80%).\n\nA total of 42% of employee savings was invested in corporate mutual fund holding only Air Liquide shares instead of 37% last year.\n\n## 2. Employee share ownership\n\nThe Group is keen to involve its employees in its development. These employees share ownership transactions contribute significantly to increasing employee motivation and sense of belonging to the Group.\n\nSince 1986, the Company has regularly performed share capital increases reserved for Group employees, for which subscription is offered at a preferential rate. The most recent capital increase, conducted in November 2018, resulted in the subscription of 1,049,529 shares by 19,078 Group employees, representing 29.4% of the eligible employees in 72 countries.\n\nIn France, the shares subscribed in these capital increases are also eligible for the preferential tax regime applicable provided that they are blocked over a period of five years, while those held abroad are governed by the legal regulations prevailing in each relevant country.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the share of capital held by Group employees and former employees was estimated at 2.5%, of which 1.7% corresponds (within the meaning of article L. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code) to shares subscribed by employees under employee-reserved capital increases or held through mutual funds. The percentage of Group employees holding L'Air Liquide S.A. shares totaled around 40% of the workforce.\n\nAir Liquide wishes to pursue this strategy and further the development of its employee share ownership, by regularly offering share capital increases to employees.",

The IFRS standards and interpretations as adopted by the European Union are available at the following website:\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standardsregulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-and-supplementary-acts/ acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps\\_en\n\nExcept for amendments 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - phase 2' (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4, and IFRS 16), the Group has not anticipated any new standards, amendments to existing standards or new interpretations published by the IASB but not yet approved or not yet mandatory in the European Union, as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in millions of euros. They were approved by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021. They will be submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting on May 4, 2021.\n\n## NEW IFRS/uni00A0AND INTERPRETATIONS\n\n- 1. Standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union whose application is mandatory as of January 1, 2020\n\nThe following texts have no material impact on the Group financial statements:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 'Definition of Material', issued on October 31, 2018;\n- \u25a0 amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, issued on March 29, 2018;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', issued on October 22, 2018.\n- 2. Standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union whose application is optional in 2020\n\nThe Group has opted for early application of amendments 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - phase 2' (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4, and IFRS 16), issued on August 27, 2020.\n\nThe Group did not apply the amendment to IFRS 16 'Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions', issued on May 28, 2020 and of which the implementation is optional.\n\nIn addition, the following texts are not applicable to the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments to IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts - deferral of IFRS 19', issued on June 25, 2020.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## 3. Standards, interpretations and amendments not yet endorsed by the European Union\n\nThe impacts on the financial statements of texts published by the IASB as of December 31, 2020 and not yet endorsed by the European Union are currently being analyzed. These texts are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of Effective Date', issued on January 23, 2020 and July 15, 2020 respectively;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment', to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets', and the annual Improvements 2018-2020, issued on May 14, 2020.\n\nIn addition, the following texts are not applicable to the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts', issued on May 18, 2017.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires Group or subsidiary management to make estimates and use certain assumptions which have a significant impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the notes related to these assets and liabilities, the profit and expense items in the income statement and the commitments relating to the period-end. Balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement line items could differ should the subsequent actual results differ from the estimates. The most significant estimates and assumptions concern namely:\n\n- \u25a0 the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and amortization: these estimates are described in section 5.e of the accounting policies;\n- \u25a0 the assumptions used to determine provisions for employee retirement benefit obligations: the actuarial assumptions used (employee turnover, mortality, retirement age, salary increase, etc.), and the discount rates used to determine the present value of obligations, as described in section 11.b of the accounting policies and in note 23.3;\n- \u25a0 the estimates and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, as described in section 5.f. of the accounting policies and in note 10.2;\n- \u25a0 the methods used to recover deferred tax assets on the balance sheet;\n- \u25a0 the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses;\n- \u25a0 the accounting methods for the margin of the Engineering & Construction contracts that are set out in section  3.b of the accounting policies.\n- \u25a0 the assumptions retained to evaluate the lease liability (IFRS 16): lease term and discount rate. They are described in section 5.g of the accounting principles.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nIn addition, the Group considers that climate risks are material, even though their quantified impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group is not material. The Group takes into account these risks in its closing assumptions and incorporates their potential impact in its financial statements. In particular, climate risks are taken into account when carrying out closing procedures, in particular the analysis of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and amortization, the review of the estimates and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, and the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 32/IFRS 9. The carrying amount of other assets and liabilities hedged against fair value risk is adjusted to take into account the changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risks. In addition, the principles of fairness, going concern, and consistency were applied.\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe consolidation methods used are:\n\n- \u25a0 full consolidation method for subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue of joint operations are recognized in relation to the Group's interest in these entities;\n- \u25a0 equity method for joint ventures and associates.\n\n## a. Subsidiaries\n\nAll the subsidiaries or companies in which the Air Liquide Group exercises exclusive control are fully consolidated. Control exists when all the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities;\n- \u25a0 the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity;\n- \u25a0 the Group has the ability to use its power over the entity so that it affects the amount of the returns.\n\nCompanies are fully consolidated from the date the Group obtains control and until the date on which control is transferred outside the Group.\n\n## b. Joint operations\n\nJoint operations are joint arrangements whereby the Air Liquide Group has joint control with one or several parties through a contractual agreement, which gives it rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the entity.\n\nAssets, liabilities, expenses and revenue of joint operations are recognized in relation to the Group's interest in these entities. These amounts are recorded on each relevant line of the financial statements as for the consolidated entities.\n\n## c. Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the Air Liquide Group has joint control with one or several parties through a contractual agreement, which gives it rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nJoint ventures are consolidated using the equity method. Under this one, the net assets and net profit of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn acquisition of an investment in a joint venture, goodwill relating to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\n## d. Associates\n\nAssociates are investments over which the Air Liquide Group has significant influence (generally when the Group has more than a 20% interest), but no control.\n\nAssociates are consolidated using the equity method. Under this one, the net assets and net profit of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn acquisition of an investment in an associate, the goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are prepared as of December 31.\n\n## e. Inter-company transactions\n\nAll inter-company receivables and payables, income and expenses and profits or losses are eliminated.\n\n## 2. TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COMPANIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE EURO\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it carries out its operations. In the majority of cases, the functional currency corresponds to the local currency. However, a functional currency other than the local currency can be retained for certain entities, provided that it represents the currency of the main transactions carried out by the entity and that it ensures faithful representation of its economic environment.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 balance sheet items, at the official year-end exchange rates;\n- \u25a0 income statement and cash flow statement items, using the average exchange rate over the period for each currency.\n\nExchange differences are recognized under a separate item 'Translation reserves' in gains and losses recognized directly in equity.\n\nCumulative foreign exchange gains and losses as of January 1, 2004 arising from the translation into euros of the financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro have been maintained as a separate component of equity.\n\nOn removal from the scope of consolidation, the cumulative exchange differences of a company whose functional currency is not the euro are recognized in the income statement.\n\nSince July 1, 2018, Argentina appears among hyperinflationary countries. The impacts of hyperinflation of this country for 2020 financial year are not significant for the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 3. REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe analysis of revenue recognition is based on the Group's activities, as follow:\n\n## a. Gas & Services\n\nThe supply of gas involves local production in order to limit transport costs. Therefore, Air Liquide gas production units are located throughout the world and can supply several types of customers and industries, with the relevant volumes and services required:\n\n## Large Industry\n\nThis business is characterized by the supply of large quantities of gas contracted for a period of 15 years or longer with a limited number of customers. The Group guarantees a high level of reliability and availability of gas supply with continued service, over the long-term. In return, these contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through firm purchase clauses (take-or-pay). Due to the volume of gas to be supplied, Air Liquide supplies its Large Industry customers directly by pipelines, from a dedicated plant or different plants connected by a network.\n\nThese plants represent significant investments that are generally made in a way to share the production assets with the other business lines of the Group, particularly the Industrial Merchant business, or intended to serve the customers in an industrial basin that is connected on a pipeline network. In these cases, the assets are not identified under the meaning of IFRS 16 \u00abLeases\u00bb and no lease contract is contained in the contracts with customers. When the customer's gas supply comes from a dedicated plant, the Group may decide on the use of these plants under the meaning of IFRS 16 \u00abLeases\u00bb. Consequently, the gas supply contracts for the Large Industry business do not contain leases.\n\nCustomers of the Large Industry business simultaneously receive and consume the benefits granted by the gas supply service or its availability. As a result, the revenue recognition related to these contracts occurs when the gas is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available.\n\n## Industrial Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics\n\nThe Industrial Merchant business relies mainly on the gas production capacity of Large Industry and thereafter develops its own distribution logistics. This business is characterized by a wide range of customers and markets. The contract terms can be up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and up to 15  years for small on-site gas generators.\n\nHealthcare business supplies medical gases, hygiene products, services as well as medical devices to hospitals and patients in their homes. It also produces and distributes healthcare specialty ingredients for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and vaccine markets.\n\nThe Electronics business supplies its customers with (i) carrier gases with a business model based on long-term contracts and on guaranteed minimum volumes with take-or-pay type clauses, (ii) electronics specialty materials in the form of pure or mixed gases, (iii) advanced materials, (iv) equipment and installations and (v) services notably on-site quality control and fluid management services.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nFor safety and quality reasons, Air Liquide supplies gas with its own equipment (small generators, storage tank, cylinders). Customers have no right of control on the identified assets under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases'. Consequently, the gas supply contracts for these businesses do not contain leases and the revenue recognition occurs as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 gas supply: the revenue recognition occurs when the gas is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available;\n- \u25a0 sale of standard equipment and materials: the revenue recognition occurs when the control of these equipment and materials is transferred, which generally takes place at their delivery;\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and installations: the transfer of control occurs over the time, together with their construction. Consequently, the revenue recognition occurs based on the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date;\n- \u25a0 service: the revenue recognition occurs when the service is provided.\n\n## b. Engineering & Construction\n\nAir Liquide enters into contracts to design and build production units worldwide for the Group's own account and for third-party customers.\n\nThe control of installations is transferred progressively with their design / construction. Consequently, the revenue recognition is based on the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date. The costs associated are recognized as an expense in the period when incurred. The stage of completion is assessed by using the ratio of contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date versus total estimated contract costs.\n\nThe margin realized at the stage of completion is recognized only when it can be reliably measured. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is immediately recognized as a provision for onerous contracts.\n\n## c. Global Markets & Technologies\n\nThe Global Markets & Technologies business focuses on new markets requiring a global approach. This business is growing mainly within the following markets:\n\n- \u25a0 new markets relating to the energy transition, as well as space, aerospace, and extreme cryogenics markets. As a consequence of its nature, the analysis of the revenue recognition on this market is done on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of performance obligations;\n- \u25a0 gas usages by the actors in the maritime sector, namely offshore oil and gas platforms, offshore wind turbines, or cryogenic transportation by sea. The analysis carried out for Industrial Merchant is applicable to this market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. TAXES\n\n## a. Income tax expense\n\nThe tax rate is calculated on the basis of the fiscal regulations enacted or substantively enacted at the fiscal year closing date in each of the countries where the Group's companies carry out their business.\n\nThe Group's applicable tax rate corresponds to the average of the theoretical tax rates in force in each of the countries, weighted according to profit obtained in each of these countries.\n\nThe average effective tax rate is calculated as follows: (current and deferred income tax expense) / (net profit before tax less share of profit of associates, dividends received and net profit from discontinued operations).",

Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base (excluding non-deductible goodwill and the other exceptions provided in IAS 12), the tax loss carryforwards and the unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized on all deductible temporary differences provided that it is highly probable that the tax benefits will be realized in future years.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated at the tax rate applicable when the temporary difference is reversed and allowed under local regulations at the period-end date. The liability method is applied and any changes to the tax rates are recognized in the income statement, except those related to items directly recognized in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the entities have a legally enforceable right to offset and if they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority. Deferred taxes are not discounted.\n\nDeferred taxes are mainly due to temporary differences between the tax and economic depreciation of assets, the carryforward of tax losses and provisions not immediately deductible for tax purposes, such as employee benefit provisions.\n\nWhen the Group decides not to distribute profits retained by the subsidiary within the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized.\n\n## 5. NON-CURRENT ASSETS\n\n## a. Goodwill and business combinations\n\n## Business combinations as of January 1, 2010\n\nThe Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 revised and IAS 27 revised since January 1, 2010.\n\nWhen the Group obtains control of an acquiree, the business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method on the acquisition date, in accordance with IFRS 3 revised:\n\n- \u25a0 the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 any minority interests in an acquiree are measured as the minority interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets or at fair value. This option is applied on a case-by-case basis;\n- \u25a0 the consideration transferred and any contingent consideration are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related costs are recorded as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\n\nFor a business combination achieved in stages, any previously held equity interests in the acquiree are measured at the acquisition-date fair value. Any resulting gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe measurement period of a business combination shall not exceed 12 months as of the acquisition date. Any adjustments, after the measurement period, of the consideration transferred and the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded in the income statement.\n\nOn the acquisition date, goodwill is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as the difference between:\n\n- \u25a0 the consideration transferred plus the amount of minority interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the previously held equity interest; and,\n- \u25a0 the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.\n\nNegative goodwill is recognized immediately through profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of cash-generating units that benefit from business combination synergies. Subsequently, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are any indications of impairment, in accordance with the method described in section 5.f.\n\n## Business combinations prior to January 1, 2010\n\nBusiness combinations achieved prior to January 1, 2010 have been accounted for in accordance with the former versions of IFRS 3 and IAS 27. These standards had already adopted the acquisition method in the version published by the IASB in March 2004. The main provisions that differed from the revised standards are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 minority interests were measured based on their share of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree and the fair value measurement option did not exist;\n- \u25a0 earn-outs were included in the acquisition cost, without time limits, when the payment was deemed probable and the amount could be reliably measured;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related costs were recorded in the cost of the business combination.\n\nFor an acquisition achieved in stages, the fair value remeasurement of any previously held net asset was recognized in equity.\n\nFor an acquisition of minority interests in a previously held company, the difference between the acquisition cost and the net carrying amount of the minority interests was recorded in goodwill.\n\nAt the time of the transition to IFRS  and in accordance with the exemption offered by IFRS 1, the Group decided not to apply IFRS 3 'Business combinations' retrospectively for acquisitions that took place prior to January 1, 2004.\n\n## b. Research and Development expenditures\n\nResearch and Development expenditures include all costs related to the scientific and technical activities, patent work, education and training necessary to ensure the development, manufacturing, start-up, and commercialization of new or improved products or processes.\n\nAccording to IAS 38, development costs shall be capitalized if, and only if, the Group can meet all of the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the project is clearly identified and the related costs are itemized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the technical and industrial feasibility of completing the project is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset arising from it;\n- \u25a0 the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset arising from the project;\n- \u25a0 the Group can demonstrate how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- \u25a0 the Group has adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset.\n\nWhen these conditions are not satisfied, development costs generated by the Group are recognized as an expense when incurred.\n\nResearch expenditure is recognized as an expense when incurred.",

        "page_content": "## c. Internally generated intangible assets\n\nInternally generated intangible assets primarily include the development costs of information management systems. These costs are capitalized only if they satisfy the criteria as defined by IAS 38 and described above.\n\nInternal and external development costs on management information systems arising from the development phase are capitalized. Significant maintenance and improvement costs are added to the initial cost of assets if they specifically meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives.\n\n## d. Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include separately acquired intangible assets such as software, licenses, and intellectual property rights. They also include the technology, brands and customer contracts valued upon the acquisition of companies in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nWith the exception of certain brands, intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives. Information management systems are generally amortized over a period comprised between five and eight years and customer contracts over a maximum period of 25 years, considering the probabilities of renewal.\n\n## e. Property, plant and equipment\n\nLand, buildings and equipment are carried at their acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nIn the event of mandatory dismantling or asset removals, related costs are added to the initial cost of the relevant assets and provisions are recognized to cover these costs.\n\nInterest costs on borrowings to finance the construction of property, plant, and equipment are capitalized during the period of construction when they relate to the financing of industrial projects over a twelvemonth construction period, or longer.\n\nWhere parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted separately and depreciated over their own useful lives.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. The costs of major inspections and overhauls are recognized as a separate component of the asset and are depreciated over the period between two major overhauls.\n\nDepreciation is calculated according to the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 20 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 cylinders: 10 to 40 years;\n- \u25a0 production units: 15 to 20 years;\n- \u25a0 pipelines: 15 to 35 years;\n- \u25a0 other equipment: 5 to 30 years.\n\nThe estimated useful lives are reviewed regularly and changes in the estimates are recorded prospectively from the date of change.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## f. Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group regularly assesses whether there are any indications of asset impairment. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is greater than its recoverable amount, defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (net fair value) and the value in use.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nImpairment tests are performed systematically once a year for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\n\nAssets that do not generate largely independent cash flows are grouped according to the cash-generating units (CGUs) to which they belong. A cash-generating unit is an identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets. They are mainly determined on a geographical basis and by reference to the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nIn practice, the Group performs impairment tests at various levels pursuant to these principles:\n\n- \u25a0 dedicated and on-site plants are tested individually;\n- \u25a0 pipelines and plants that provide these pipelines are tested at the network level;\n- \u25a0 liquid gas and hydrogen/CO plants are grouped together according to the plants' customer market;\n- \u25a0 other assets are allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units.\n\nThe cash-generating units of the Gas & Services activity are determined on a geographical basis. The other activities are managed at a worldwide level (Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies).\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units that benefit from business combination synergies and which represent the levels at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.\n\nWhen performing impairment tests on cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units comprising goodwill, the Group uses the market multiples approach to determine if the goodwill is subject to impairment. Insofar as the fair value is not significantly greater than the net carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units, the Group confirms the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units using the estimated cash flow approach (value in use).\n\nFor other cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, and assets whose value is tested on an individual basis, the Group determines the recoverable amount using the estimated cash flow approach (value in use).\n\nThe market multiples used are determined based on the market value of the Air Liquide Group. The differences between the resulting multiples and those of comparable companies are not material.\n\nThe growth rates, taken into account with respect to the cash flow estimates for cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, are determined based on the activity and geographical location of the CGU considered.\n\nIn assessing value in use for property, plant and equipment, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value. Cash flows are measured over the asset's estimated period of use, taking into account customer contract terms and technical obsolescence.\n\nThe discount rate depends on the nature, the location of the asset and the customer market. It is determined according to the minimum level of profitability expected from the investment considering industrial and commercial risks and credit terms.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of an asset, a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized immediately through profit and loss. An impairment loss of a cash-generating unit is first allocated to goodwill.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount again, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed to the income statement, with the exception of impairment losses on goodwill, which cannot be reversed.",

Leases\n\nIn the course of its activity, the Group enters as a lessee in contracts mainly for the following types of assets:\n\n- \u25a0 land, buildings and offices;\n- \u25a0 transportation equipment, in particular for Industrial Merchant and Healthcare business lines;\n- \u25a0 other equipment.\n\nAccording to IFRS 16, any contract (apart from exceptions mentioned below) containing a lease leads to recognition on the lessee's balance sheet of a right-of-use of the leased asset and a lease liability related to the present value of the commitments for future lease payments (lease liability).\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys to the Group the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. In particular, the Group has concluded that transportation contracts which confer to the supplier the substantive right to substitute the vehicle throughout the period of use and/or the control on the choice of the route, the driver and maintenance policy, are service contracts and do not meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.\n\nIn addition, the Group has chosen not to apply IFRS 16:\n\n- \u25a0 to the lease contracts having a lease terms of 12 months or less;\n- \u25a0 to the lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value, in particular, office and telephony equipment, computers and small IT equipment. Lease contracts for data centers are analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe main assumptions used to measure the right-of-use and the lease liability are:\n\n- \u25a0 lease term. It corresponds to the non-cancellable period for which a lessee has the right to use an underlying asset, together with periods covered by an option to extend or to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise (for options to extend) or not to exercise (for options to terminate) such options. The probability to exercise or not an option is determined by type of contracts or on a case-by-case basis according to contractual terms, regulatory environment and the nature of the underlying asset (in particular, its technical specificity and strategic location);\n- \u25a0 the discount rate used for evaluation of the lease liability. The discount rate retained is the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Due to the centralized financing in the Group, it corresponds for each subsidiary to the interest rate for intragroup borrowings determined according to the currency of the lease contract, the country and the lease term taking into account the repayment profile (linear amortization of the lease liability).\n\n## 6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## a. Non-current financial instruments\n\n## Non-consolidated investments\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies that are not accounted for using the equity method are classified as assets measured at fair value. These investments are not held for trading, consequently, at initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. In this case, changes in fair value are not reclassified to net result upon disposal of these investments.\n\nDividends from these investments are recognized in other financial income.\n\n## Loans and other financial assets\n\nLoans and other financial assets are initially recognized at their fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost. Impairment tests are performed at each closing date. Any impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\n## b. Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are measured at their transaction price upon initial recognition and then at amortized cost less any impairment losses based on expected credit losses model.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated on the basis of a matrix consisting in using historical loss rates adjusted depending on actual observable conditions. Expected credit losses are estimated at each closing date in the following manner:\n\n- \u25a0 segregating trade receivables into appropriate groups, in particular depending on the activities of the Group, type and size of client and its market segment;\n- \u25a0 within each group of trade receivables, determining of age-bands;\n- \u25a0 for each age-band identification of losses realized in previous financial year;\n- \u25a0 adjusting if necessary historical loss rate depending on actual observable conditions in order to take into account, in particular, current market conditions, type of client, credit management practices of the Group as well as specific information concerning individual customers;\n- \u25a0 application of loss rates estimated in this way to each age-band of trade receivables.\n\nFor all construction contracts in progress at the year-end, the gross amounts payable by and to customers represent the sum of costs incurred plus profits recognized using the percentage of completion method, equivalent to total revenue recorded using the percentage of completion method, less the amount of advances received.\n\nAmounts payable by customers are presented in trade receivables. Amounts due to customers are presented in other current liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Assignments of trade receivables\n\nAssignments of trade receivables are derecognized in the balance sheet when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows related to these receivables to the assignee; or\n- \u25a0 the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows related to these receivables, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to the assignee in an arrangement that cumulatively meets the following three conditions:\n- - the Group has no obligation to pay to the assignee unless it collects the equivalent amount,\n- - the Group is prohibited from selling or pledging the receivables other than as security for the obligation to pay cash flows to the assignee,\n- - the Group has an obligation to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the assignee without material delay;\n- \u25a0 and the Group transfers substantially all the risks and awards of ownership of the receivables, in particular credit risk and risk of late payment.\n\n## c. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, current bank accounts, and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and do not present a material risk of a change in value.\n\nShort-term investments include temporary cash investments maturing in less than three months (commercial paper, certificates of deposit and money market funds) whose minimum long-term rating is A (S&P) or A2 (Moody's).\n\nAs cash investments maturing in less than three months are exposed to a negligible risk of a change in value, they are recognized at historical cost (including accrued interest) which is considered to approximate fair value.\n\n## d. Trade payables\n\nThe Group sets up supplier paying services agreements with partner banks to facilitate the processing of supplier invoices payments. The Group analyzes the main contract features that enable to keep the trade payables qualification. In particular, the Group ensures that the following characteristics are met:\n\n- \u25a0 no deviation of the payment terms of the underlying payable between the financing party and the original supplier. In other words, the Group must pay to the bank no later than the payment term of invoice;\n- \u25a0 payment terms negotiations between Air Liquide and supplier must be conducted independently of any negotiation on paying service agreement. In particular, payment terms shall not be subject to the supplier's success in selling invoices to the bank;\n- \u25a0 the terms of contract with the supplier shall not be explicitly linked to any payment term extension. Payment term with a particular supplier must be homogenous, independently of the participation of a particular invoice in the program or not;\n- \u25a0 payment terms should stay within the ordinary industry/sector norms and local regulation, and should not be tied to the participation in the paying services agreement;\n- \u25a0 program structures should avoid debt-like features such as interest and fees paid by Air Liquide to the bank or supplier;\n- \u25a0 tri-party agreements between Air Liquide, the supplier and the bank that pre-arrange the financing of the invoices owed by Air Liquide to the supplier shall be avoided.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## e. Current and non-current borrowings\n\nBorrowings include bonds and other bank borrowings (including the put options granted to minority shareholders).\n\nAt inception, borrowings are recognized at fair value corresponding to the net proceeds collected. At each balance sheet date, except for put options granted to minority shareholders (see section 10 'Minority Interests'), they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Under this method, the borrowing cost includes the redemption premiums and issuance costs initially deducted from the nominal amount of the borrowing in liabilities.\n\nBorrowings maturing in less than one year are classified as current borrowings.\n\nBorrowings hedged by interest rate swaps are recognized on a hedge accounting basis.\n\n## f. Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks relating to the Group's financial and operating activities. For all these transactions, the Group applies hedge accounting and documents, at the inception of the transaction, the type of hedging relationship, the hedging instruments, and the nature and term of the hedged item.\n\nApplying hedge accounting has the following consequences:\n\n- \u25a0 fair value hedges for existing assets and liabilities: the hedged portion of the item is carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement, where they are offset by the corresponding changes in fair value of the hedging instruments (except for the impact of premiums/ discounts);\n- \u25a0 future cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded directly in equity (items that may be subsequently reclassified to income statement), while the change in the fair value of the hedged item is not recognized in the balance sheet. The change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in other financial income or expenses. When the hedged transactions occur and are recorded, amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified in the income statement;\n- \u25a0 hedges of net investments in a foreign entity: the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in gains and losses recognized directly in equity under 'Translation reserves'. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognized in 'Other financial income and expenses'. Once the foreign entity subject to the net investment hedge is sold, the loss or profit initially recognized in translation reserves is recognized in profit or loss, within the gain or loss generated.\n\nHowever, in limited circumstances, certain types of derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting; they are carried at fair value through 'Other financial income and expenses' with an offsetting entry in financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of assets, liabilities and derivatives is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.",

Assets classified as held for sale\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This classification occurs when the Group takes the decision to sell them and that the sale is considered highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale are presented on different lines of the balance sheet. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated (amortized) as of the date they are classified as assets or disposal groups held for sale.\n\nWhen a sale involving the loss of control of the subsidiary is considered highly probable, all the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are classified as being held for sale, independently of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after its sale.\n\n## b. Discontinued operations\n\nA discontinued operation is a clearly identifiable component that the Group either has abandoned or that is classified as held for sale:\n\n- \u25a0 representing a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n- \u25a0 being part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or,\n- \u25a0 being a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nOnce the criteria are met, the profit and loss and the cash flow from discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and the consolidated cash flow statement for each period.\n\n## 8. INVENTORIES AND WORK-IN-PROGRESS\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct and indirect labor costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## 9. SHARE CAPITAL, RESERVES AND TREASURY SHARES\n\nAir Liquide's share capital is composed of ordinary shares.\n\nRetained earnings include the following items:\n\n- \u25a0 translation reserves: exchange differences arising from the translation into euros of financial statements prepared by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro are recorded in translation reserves. Fair value changes in net investment hedges of these foreign subsidiaries are also recorded in this reserve;\n- \u25a0 fair value of financial instruments: this item records accumulated fair value changes in the effective portion of cash flow hedge derivatives (transactions not yet recognized in the accounts);\n- \u25a0 actuarial gains and losses: all actuarial gains and losses and adjustments arising from the asset ceiling, net of deferred taxes, are recognized in consolidated reserves in the period in which they occur.\n\nWhen the Group buys back its own shares, they are classified as treasury shares at the purchase price and presented as a deduction from equity for the consideration paid. The profit or loss from the sale of treasury shares is recognized directly in equity, net of tax.\n\nFurthermore, acquisitions or disposals of minority interests, without change in control, are considered as transactions with the Group's shareholders. Thus, the difference between the price paid to increase the percentage of interest in entities that are already controlled and the additional share of equity thus acquired is recognized in Shareholders' equity. Similarly, a decrease in the Group's percentage interest in a controlled entity is accounted for as an equity transaction with no impact on profit or loss.\n\nDisposals of shares with loss of control give rise to the recognition in disposal gains or losses of the change in fair value calculated for the total investment at the date of disposal. Any investments retained, where applicable, will be measured at fair value at the date when control is lost.\n\n## 10. MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nTransactions with minority interests, without impact on the control, are considered as transactions with the Group's shareholders and are registered in shareholders' equity.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32, put options granted to minority shareholders are recorded as borrowings at the option's estimated strike price.\n\nThe share in the net assets of subsidiaries is reclassified from 'Minority interests' to 'Borrowings'.\n\nDue to the absence of any specific IFRS guidance, the Group has elected to recognize the consideration for the difference between the strike price of the option granted and the value of the minority interests reclassified as borrowings in shareholders' equity - Group share.\n\nMinority interests in profit and loss do not change and still reflect present ownership interests.",

Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event;\n- \u25a0 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nRestructuring provisions include only the direct costs arising from the restructuring and are recognized in the period in which the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either begun or been announced. When these plans involve termination benefits, the resulting provisions are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- \u25a0 when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits;\n- \u25a0 when the provision of the related restructuring is recognized.\n\nA provision for losses on contracts is recognized when the expected benefits from the contract are lower than the cost of satisfying the obligations under the contract.\n\n## b. Pensions and employee benefits\n\nThe Group provides its employees with various pension plans, termination benefits, jubilees and other post-employment benefits for both active and retired employees. The characteristics of each plan vary according to the laws and regulations applicable in each country as well as each subsidiary policy.\n\nThese benefits are covered by two types of plan:\n\n- \u25a0 defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Group grants both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole obligation is to pay regular contributions. The employer's obligation is limited to payment of the planned contributions. The employer does not grant any guarantees on the future level of benefits paid to the employee or retiree (means-based obligation). The annual pension expense is equal to the contribution paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation. It is recognized in 'Personnel expenses'.\n\nDefined benefit plans are those by which the employer guarantees the future level of benefits defined in the agreement, most often depending on the employee's salary and seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either financed by contributions to a fund specialized in managing the amounts received;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn the case of defined benefit plans, retirement and similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take into account the following assumptions: salary increases, employee turnover, retirement date, life expectancy, inflation and appropriate discount rates for each country.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nDefined benefit plans are covered by external pension funds in certain cases. The assets of these plans are mostly invested in bonds or equities carried at their fair value.\n\nAll actuarial gains and losses as well as any adjustment arising from the asset ceiling are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n\nActuarial assumptions used vary according to the demographic and economic conditions prevailing in each country where the Group has pension plans.\n\nDiscount rates used to measure the present value of the Company's obligations and the net interest cost are determined by reference to market yields on High-Quality corporate bonds. Where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds with the same maturity at the valuation date shall be used. In the Euro zone, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, discount rates were determined using tools designed by independent actuaries. Their database uses several hundred different corporate bonds with a minimum AA-rating and maturities ranging from one to 30 years. Cash flows of expected benefits are subsequently discounted using rates associated to each maturity.\n\nValuations are carried out annually by independent actuaries for significant plans and every three years for other plans unless there are material changes in assumptions or major events that necessitate a new calculation.\n\nImpacts related to defined benefit plans are registered as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the service cost, the gain relating to curtailments and settlements, and the actuarial gains and losses from other long-term benefits and recognized in 'Personnel expenses';\n- \u25a0 net interest cost for defined benefits is registered in 'Other financial income and expenses';\n- \u25a0 past service cost is recorded in profit or loss according to the nature of the change to the plan that generated it (i.e. either in 'Personnel expenses' or in 'Other financial income and expenses');\n- \u25a0 actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plans, retirement termination payments, and medical plans are recorded in 'Gains and losses recognized directly in equity'.\n\n## 12. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND/uni00A0BALANCES\n\nForeign currency transactions are recognized according to the following principles:\n\n- \u25a0 foreign currency transactions are translated by each company into its functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction;\n- \u25a0 at year-end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the closing exchange rate.\n\nExchange differences relating to commercial transactions are recognized in operating profit. For financial transactions, exchange differences are recognized in financial income and expenses except for differences resulting from the hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity that are directly recognized in equity until the net investment is removed from the consolidation scope.",

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nContingent assets and liabilities arise from past events, the outcome of which depends on future uncertain events.\n\nContingent liabilities represent:\n\n- \u25a0 possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or,\n- \u25a0 present obligations that arise from past events, but that are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nContingent assets and liabilities that are material are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination, which are recognized in accordance with IFRS 3 revised.\n\n## 14. GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n\nGovernment grants received are initially recognized in 'Other non-current liabilities'. They are then recognized as income in the income statement for the period:\n\n- \u25a0 on the same basis as the subsidized assets are depreciated in the case of government grants related to assets;\n- \u25a0 deducted from the costs intended to be compensated in the case of government grants other than those related to assets.\n\nThe Group analyzes the substance of government incentives delivered through the tax system and selects an accounting treatment coherent with such substance.\n\n## 15. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nThe Group grants stock options and performance shares to Executive Officers and some employees.\n\nStock options and performance shares are measured at fair value on the grant date. Their fair value is recognized as a 'Personnel expense' in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\nThe valuation is performed by an independent expert, using mathematical models appropriate to the characteristics of each plan. It takes into account the market vesting conditions associated to each one. The fair value measured at the grant date is not subject to re-evaluation due to changes in market conditions.\n\nVesting conditions, other than market ones, have no impact on the fair value measurement of services received but adjust the expense that is recognized according to the number of equity instruments actually granted.\n\nThe dilution effect of non-vested stock option plans and performance share allocations is reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nFor employee savings plans, the capital increases reserved for employees and performed under conditions that differ from market conditions result in the recognition of an expense. This expense corresponds to the contribution paid by the entity and the discount on the share price less the cost of non-transferability for the employees.\n\n## Share subscription option plans\n\nOptions are valued using the following main underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 volatility: implicit;\n- \u25a0 risk-free interest rate: zero-coupon benchmark rate at the plan issue date and matching the various maturities retained;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate: based on the historical average annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same age group as the plan beneficiaries. The resignation rate is used to extrapolate the number of options which will not be exercised due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.\n\n## Performance shares allocation plans\n\nPerformance shares are measured at fair value, taking into account a discount on non-transferable shares. The cost of non-transferability is measured as the cost of a two-step strategy consisting in the forward sale of shares being non-transferable for four years (or five years depending on the plan) and the purchase on the spot market of the same number of shares funded by an amortizable loan with an in fine capital repayment.\n\nValuation is based upon the following main underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 risk-free interest rate: four-year zero-coupon benchmark rate (or five-year depending on the plan) at the plan issue date plus a credit margin that would be proposed to employees;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate: based on the historical average annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same age group as the plan beneficiaries. This resignation rate is used to extrapolate the shares which will not be allocated due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.\n\n## 16. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION QUOTAS\n\nIn certain countries, the Group is subject to greenhouse gas emission quota systems.\n\nIn the absence of any specific IFRS guidance, the Group has elected to apply the ANC Regulation No. 2012-03. The Group does not buy CO2 quotas for the purpose of generating profits from fluctuations in price; therefore, at each closing date:\n\n- \u25a0 a liability is recognized if the greenhouse gas emissions are higher than the CO2 quotas held by the Group. It corresponds to the cost of CO2 quotas in shortfall to cover the greenhouse gas already emitted; or,\n- \u25a0 an asset is recognized if the greenhouse gas emissions are lower than the CO2 quotas held by the entity. It corresponds to the CO2 quotas available to cover the future greenhouse gas emissions, valued at historical cost.",

It also designs and manufactures plants in the traditional, renewable and alternative energy sectors.\n\nThe Global Markets & Technologies segment is also managed separately on a worldwide scale. It focuses on new markets which require a global approach, drawing on science, technologies, development models, and usages related to digital transformation.\n\nResearch and Development and corporate activities do not meet the operating segments definition and are thus presented within reconciliation.\n\nThe information communicated in the tables covering segment information is presented according to the same accounting principles as those used for the Group consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue is analyzed by geographical area of production (country of origin).\n\nInter-segment revenue between Gas & Services, Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies activities corresponds to the sales between these operating segments.\n\nThe Group operating performance is assessed on the basis of each segment's recurring operating income.\n\nSegment assets include non-current assets, with the exception of 'Deferred tax assets', 'Investments in associates', 'Fair value of non-current derivatives (assets)', as well as 'Inventories and work-in-progress', 'Trade receivables' and 'Other current assets'.\n\nSegment liabilities correspond to 'Provisions, pensions and other employee benefits', 'Trade payables', 'Other current liabilities' and 'Other non-current liabilities'.\n\nSegment profits, assets and liabilities consist of amounts directly attributable to each segment, provided they can be allocated to the segment on a reasonable basis.\n\n## 2. NET DEBT\n\nThe net debt includes:\n\n- \u25a0 current and non-current borrowings, as defined in section 6.e of accounting policies, minus the fair value of hedging derivative assets to cover borrowings;\n\nreduced by:\n\n- \u25a0 cash and cash equivalents, as defined in section 6.c of accounting policies, minus the fair value of hedging derivative instruments recorded in liabilities to cover loans.\n\nThe net debt does not include the lease liabilities as defined in section 5.g of accounting policies.\n\n## 3. INFORMATION ON INTERESTS IN JOINT ARRANGEMENTS OR ASSOCIATES\n\nThe materiality of the interests in joint arrangements or associates is assessed according to the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 contribution of the entity to the Group's operating income recurring;\n- \u25a0 share of these interests in the Group's net assets;\n- \u25a0 dividends paid to these interests.\n\n## 4. INFORMATION ON MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nThe materiality of the minority interests is assessed according to an analysis of:\n\n- \u25a0 the minority interests' share in the Group's net assets;\n- \u25a0 the contribution to the Group's operating income recurring of the subsidiary having minority interests;\n- \u25a0 dividends paid to minority interests.\n\n## 5.

Consequently, governments from all over the world have been forced to adopt social and economic restrictive measures in order to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nThese measures have significantly affected the worldwide economy. In this context, Air Liquide Group has assessed the consequences of the pandemic in its financial statements and has reported the impact on the evolution of its activities (upwards or downwards) as well as inefficiencies caused by the health crisis in each line within operating income recurring.\n\nNevertheless, in order to ensure the continuity of its accounting methods and the presentation of its Consolidated Income Statement, Air Liquide has decided to report some expenses related to the Covid-19 outbreak in \u00abOther non-recurring operating expenses\u00bb. The criterias to be met are the following:\n\n- \u25a0 direct or incremental expenses linked to the pandemic and pertaining to specific and limited natures of cost;\n- \u25a0 expenses related to recurring activity and operations of the Group should remain within 'Operating income recurring' even if they have been adversely impacted by the crisis.\n\nThe impact of these costs on the Group Financial Statements amounts to 65.2 million euros (before taxes) and is reported in \u00abOther non-recurring operating expenses\u00bb.\n\nGiven the current environment:\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has not identified any signs of impairment directly resulting from the current health crisis;\n- \u25a0 in addition, as part of the preparation of its medium-term plan, the Group has carried out a strategic review of its activities and its assets portfolio, taking into account the impacts of the health crisis on specific markets. The impairment losses resulting from this strategic review have been taken into account in the financial statements as of December 31, 2020;\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has reviewed indicators of impairment of trade receivables and has not identified any item that could justify a significant increase in credit losses. The expected credit risk assessment has however been adjusted to reflect the increased risk of bankruptcies;\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has reviewed the impact of the pandemic on its cash position (presented in note 20) and has not identified any impact on the Group liquidity position.",

Revenue was down -4.5% after adjusting for the cumulative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.

The key model assumptions used, such as market multiples and the discount rate, took into account the stock market and world economic context.\n\nThe market multiples used were determined using the Air Liquide Group market value as of December 31, 2020. Multiples obtained do not materially differ from those of companies whose activity is similar to that of the Group.\n\nThe growth rates used for estimating the cash flows of cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units were significantly lower than the Group's historical average growth rates. Growth rates are comprised between 1% and 3% in mature markets, and up to 5.5% in emerging markets.\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital used was 4.4% as of December 31, 2020 (6.4% as of December 31, 2019). The weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for the activity and the geographical location of the cash-generating units being tested.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the recoverable amounts of each cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units significantly exceeded their net carrying amounts.\n\nConsidering the activity of the Air Liquide Group, no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in an impairment. The Gas & Services activity favors synergies between the different business lines by pooling assets for a given geographical area. The geographical development of the activity is generally based on local industrial investments and external growth operations throughout the Large Industries business line. The supply of gas to clients of the Large Industries business is contracted for a minimum duration of 15 years. These customer contracts provide a good visibility and guarantee of future income.",

With regards to the litigation concerning the reimbursement of the receivable, the Administrative Court of Montreuil partially sided with Air Liquide on July 21, 2014. Following the court order, L'Air Liquide S.A. received 30.3 million euros in principal and 15.0 million euros in interest on arrears. The Group appealed the decision of the Administrative Court of Montreuil on September 19, 2014 for the recovery of the balance. On appeal, the Administrative Court of Versailles partially sided with Air Liquide on July 7, 2020. Following this decision, Air Liquide received 31.8 million of euros in principal and 23.1 million of euros in interest on arrears on July 27, 2020.\n\nFollowing the decisions rendered by the Court of Appeal of Versailles and in order to challenge some of those decisions, Air Liquide and the tax administration have filed a plea before the Supreme Court (\u00abConseil d'\u00c9tat\u00bb). On October 23, the Conseil d'\u00c9tat decided to refer a question to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Air Liquide Group, being a party to this case, is entitled to send a statement to the Court of Justice of the European Union before the end of February 2022.\n\n## Note/uni00A014  Investments in associates\n\n## 14.1.

COMPANY TREASURY SHARES\n\nTreasury shares are Air Liquide shares held by the Group, including shares forming part of the liquidity contract in accordance with an Ethics Charter recognized by the French financial markets authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers). As of December 31, 2020, the Group held 1,525,395 treasury shares (1,616,458 as of December 31, 2019) including 11,000 treasury shares under a liquidity contract (5,000 as of December 31, 2019). Changes in the number of treasury shares are explained in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\n## 21.3. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\n## Share subscription option plans\n\nPursuant to the decisions of the Board of Directors, following the approval by the Annual General Meeting and based on the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, the Group had adopted share subscription plans for some of the senior executives of the Company and its subsidiaries worldwide, as well as corporate officers.\n\nThe purpose of these options is to provide an incentive to key executives, by rewarding the loyalty of high-performing executives and their actions in exceptional situations, as well as associating them with the long-term interests of shareholders.\n\nStock options are granted for a minimum price which cannot be lower than the average closing market price over the 20 trading days preceding the grant date. Options granted since October 14, 2011 must be exercised within 10 years.\n\nA four-year vesting period applies to stock options granted.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the number of outstanding share options granted by the Board of Directors under the plans approved by Annual General Meetings amounted to 2,268,200 options after adjustment (average price of 76.61 euros), or 0.48% of share capital, of which 531,349 options (average price of 77.33 euros) were granted to executive officer present as of December 31, 2020.\n\nOut of the total number of options issued pursuant to the approval by the Annual General Meeting on May 7, 2019, 9,473,214 options were retained for possible grant by the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Performance shares plans\n\nAn additional compensation system involving performance shares was set up in 2008 as a way to reward our best employees and associate their medium-term performance with the Company's objectives.\n\nThe 14 th resolution adopted by the Extraordinary Annual General Meeting held on May 7, 2019 authorizes the Board of Directors to grant free shares to Group employees, up to a maximum of 0.5% of the Company's share capital over a 38-month period. As part of this maximum attribution, free shares representing up to 0.1% of the Group's share capital can be granted to corporate officers over the same period.\n\nUnder this authority, the Board of Directors adopted:\n\n- \u25a0 two different general regulations on September 30, 2019 ('France' Plan and 'World' Plan) governing the attribution of performance shares to beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The differences between the 'France' and 'World' Plans mainly differ as to the number of years of service required - paragraph a) below, and to the correlative absence of any holding requirement for the 'World' Plan - paragraph c) below;\n- \u25a0 two different general regulations on September 29, 2020 ('France' Plan and 'World' Plan) governing the attribution of performance shares to beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The differences between the 'France' and 'World' Plans mainly differ as to the number of years of service required - paragraph a) below, and to the correlative absence of any holding requirement for the 'World' Plan - paragraph c) below.\n\nThe granted shares shall be either shares issued through a capital increase performed by the Company by no later than the definitive vesting date or shares bought back by the Company in the market prior to such date.\n\nTo date, performances shares granted are treasury shares bought back as part of the Company's shares buyback program.\n\nThe granted shares shall be of the same nature and category as those making up the Company's share capital at the date on which the plans are approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nOn September 29, 2020, the Board of Directors decided to grant 345,923 performance shares to employees (2,294 beneficiaries).\n\nSubscription options and performance shares are subject to:\n\n- a) a continued service requirement during the vesting period:\n- the shares granted to a beneficiary shall only finally vest if he or she has been an employee or corporate officer of a Group company during a vesting period, calculated as from the grant date, of three years for 'France' Plan beneficiaries and four years for 'World' Plan beneficiaries. In the event of retirement, the beneficiary retains his rights, being no longer required to satisfy the continued service requirement;\n- b) performance requirements for all performance shares allocated to all beneficiaries which are now identical to performance requirements applicable to stock-options;\n- c) a holding requirement for performance shares:\n- as from the final grant date, the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan are required to hold their shares for two additional years during which such shares may not be transferred (except in the event of disability or death).\n\nOptions granted to the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) who were attributed the highest number of options\n\nIn 2020, no options have been granted.",

They include provisions for industrial disputes and for tax risks, excluding taxes on income, respectively for 165.0 and 50.9 million euros.\n\nThe Group does not provide the detail of these provisions, considering that disclosing the amount provided for each individual litigation could be prejudicial to the Group. Nevertheless, no single litigation is likely to have a material effect on the Group's financial position or its profitability.",

        "page_content": "## Note/uni00A023  Employee benefit obligations\n\n## 23.1. PENSION PLANS\n\nThe most significant pension plans relate to France, Germany and the United States.\n\nIn France, Air Liquide provides an additional retirement benefit based on the final salary which is paid in addition to other normal pension plans. On December 31, 1995, this plan was closed to employees under age 45 or with less than 20 years of service as of January 1, 1996; the latter being covered by a defined contribution plan. These plans are unfunded. The annual amounts paid with regards to additional benefits cannot exceed a threshold set originally at 12% of total payroll or 12% of pre-tax profits of companies involved. This 12% threshold will be proportionately reduced by comparing the number of plan beneficiaries for the year to the number of plan beneficiaries for the previous year. In 2017, this additional benefit was funded subsequently to the Article 50 of the law of January 20, 2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nIAS 19 'Employee Benefits' provides a very restrictive definition of defined contribution plans; any plans not complying fully with the conditions required are defined benefit plans by default.\n\nThis restrictive definition of defined contribution plans requires Air Liquide to account for these additional benefits as a defined benefit plan in spite of the limited obligations for the Company and the nature of the obligations not being stable or continuous.\n\nThe qualification as a defined benefit plan results in the recognition of a provision with regards to the future obligations.\n\nWith the Company's obligations being limited, the valuation of what will actually be paid to retirees is uncertain. Since the effect of this threshold cannot be measured reliably, the provision recognized represents the actuarial value of the amounts to be paid out to retirees until the plan is closed, excluding any potential threshold effect. The additional retirement benefit paid by Air Liquide is aligned with the indexation of French statutory and supplementary pension plans up to a maximum annuity. Any additional annuity will not be subject to any indexation. The effects related to the revaluation cap and floor were accounted for in 'Other financial expenses'.\n\nIn Germany, there are two main Air Liquide pension plans.\n\nThe first plan provides the retirees of Lurgi (Engineering & Construction activity) with a lifetime annuity, based on the income and length of service vested in the plan at the time of retirement, the normal retirement age being 65. The plan also provides disability and widowhood pensions. This plan is now closed to new entrants, the latter benefiting from a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe second plan is an old plan covering employees of the Gas & Services activity. The plan provides a lifetime annuity, based on the average income earned over the employee's career and the length of service vested at the time of retirement, the normal retirement age being 65. The plan also provides disability, pre-retirement and widowhood pensions. It is now closed to new entrants, with new employees benefiting from another defined benefit plan. Providing a minimum length of service of ten years, the plan provides a lifetime annuity based on the average income earned over the employee's career and the length of service vested at the time of retirement, the normal retirement age being 65. The plan also provides disability, pre-retirement and widowhood pensions.\n\nIn accordance with common market practice in Germany, limited funding contributions are made to pension funds as both plans are mainly managed internally.\n\nIn the United States, Air Liquide grants retirees supplemental benefits in addition to the normal pension plans. The US plan provides a traditional final average pay benefit to those who continue to accrue benefits. A retiring employee may elect to receive their pension benefit as a lump sum or a lifetime annuity. This plan was closed to new participants in 2004 and was frozen in 2016. Therefore, employees who joined the Company before 2004 are no longer acquiring new rights on this defined benefit plan, but benefit from the defined contribution plan that has been opened since 2004 to new employees.\n\nA new plan was implemented on January 1, 2017 (Supplemental Saving plan). This plan comes on top of the basic savings plan offering additional retirement benefits beyond the tax limit of the basic plan. It represents an annual cost of around 7 million US dollars.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements",

PENSION PLAN RISK ANALYSIS\n\n## Sensitivity to movements in discount rates and other variables\n\nThe present value of obligations related to defined benefit plans is measured by discounting future cash flows. Discount rates are determined based on Government bonds rates or, when the financial markets are sufficiently liquid, on 'high-quality' corporate bond rates, which can vary from one period to another.\n\nChanges in discount rates can materially change the present value of the Group's obligations and the expense recorded in the year.\n\nThe amount of obligations is affected to a lesser extent by revised wages and inflation indexes, as well as legal changes regarding retirement age or official mortality tables.\n\n## Impact of a -0.25% decrease in discount rates\n\n|                 |   Impact on obligations as of  December 31, 2020 (in millions of euros) | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa |                                                                      62 | 3.4%                                              |\n| Americas        |                                                                      30 | 3.2%                                              |\n| Asia Pacific    |                                                                       1 | 1.0%                                              |\n| TOTAL           |                                                                      93 | 3.3%                                              |\n\nImpact on obligations as of\n\n|                 | December 31, 2019 (in millions of euros)   | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2019   |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa | 67                                         | 3.4%                                              |\n| Americas        | 30                                         | 3.1%                                              |\n| Asia Pacific    | -                                          | 0.5%                                              |\n| TOTAL           | 97                                         | 3.3%                                              |",

Any adverse movement in these variables would require additional Group contributions to the pension funds on a timely basis.\n\nPlan assets consist of shares, bonds and other assets whose value is subject to market fluctuations. A downturn in the financial markets would increase the net liabilities of defined benefit plans. The plans' coverage ratios would decrease accordingly, requiring additional Group contributions on a timely basis.\n\n| 2020                   | Shares   | Shares   | Bonds     | Bonds   | Real estate   | Real estate   | Cash      | Cash   | Others    | Others   | Total     | Total   |\n|------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Amounts  |          | % Amounts |         | % Amounts     |               | % Amounts |        | % Amounts |          | % Amounts | %       |\n| Europe / Africa        | 80       | 20.8%    | 128       | 32.9%   | 107           | 27.6%         | 46        | 11.8%  | 27        | 6.9%     | 388       | 100.0%  |\n| Americas               | 187      | 23.5%    | 553       | 69.6%   | 22            | 2.8%          | 4         | 0.5%   | 29        | 3.6%     | 795       | 100.0%  |\n| Asia Pacific           | 5        | 9.5%     | 44        | 82.5%   | -             | 0.0%          | -         | 0.0%   | 4         | 8.0%     | 53        | 100.0%  |\n| TOTAL                  | 272      | 272      | 725       | 725     | 129           | 129           | 50        | 50     | 60        | 60       | 1,236     | 1,236   |\n\n| 2019                   | Shares   | Shares   | Bonds     | Bonds   | Real estate   | Real estate   | Cash      | Cash   | Others    | Others   | Total     | Total      |\n|------------------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Amounts  |          | % Amounts |         | % Amounts     |               | % Amounts |        | % Amounts |          | % Amounts | %          |\n| Europe / Africa        | 81       | 20.8%    | 136       | 34.9%   | 103           | 26.5%         | 19        | 4.9%   | 50        | 12.9%    |           | 389 100.0% |\n| Americas               | 199      | 24.2%    | 563       | 68.5%   | 25            | 3.0%          | 4         | 0.5%   | 31        | 3.8%     |           | 822 100.0% |\n| Asia Pacific           | 13       | 21.7%    | 44        | 73.3%   | 1             | 1.7%          | -         | 0.0%   | 2         | 3.3%     |           | 60 100.0%  |\n| TOTAL                  | 293      |          | 743       |         | 129           |               | 23        |        | 83        |          | 1,271     |            |",

NET DEBT BY CURRENCY\n\nThe Group ensures a natural hedge and reduces its exposure to currency fluctuations by raising debt mainly in the currency of the cash flows that are generated to repay the debt. In most countries, and especially outside the euro, US dollar, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi zones, financing is raised in either local or foreign currency (EUR or USD) when sales contracts are indexed to foreign currency. Debt in other currencies is mainly denominated in Singapore dollar, in Canadian dollar, in British pound sterling and in Brazilian real.\n\nAs part of intra-group multi-currency financing, the Central Treasury Department converts the debt raised in financial markets into various\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\ncurrencies to finance subsidiaries in their functional currencies or their cash flow currencies. The breakdown of this hedging portfolio is shown in the table below.\n\nAccordingly, a portion of the euro debt raised was converted (1,022.1 million euros) to other currencies to finance foreign subsidiaries. As an example, 4,206.0 million euros were raised initially in US dollar, 162.3 million were raised in euros and converted in US dollar using currency swap contracts. 176.1 million euros were in cash or cash equivalent, leading to an adjusted net debt in US dollars of 4,192.2 million euros.\n\n| 2020 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt -   original issue   | Interest rate and   currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Ajusted   net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|\n| EUR                           | 7,136.6                         | (1,022.1)                            | (1,093.9)                    | 5,020.6              |\n| USD                           | 4,206.0                         | 162.3                                | (176.1)                      | 4,192.2              |\n| JPY                           | 135.0                           | 91.7                                 | (7.9)                        | 218.8                |\n| CNY                           | 394.4                           | (195.4)                              | (263.0)                      | (64.0)               |\n| Other currencies              | 528.7                           | 963.5                                | (250.5)                      | 1,241.7              |\n| TOTAL                         | 12,400.7                        | -                                    | (1,791.4)                    | 10,609.3             |\n\n| 2019 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt -   original issue   | Interest rate and   currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Ajusted   net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|\n| EUR                           | 6,982.7                         | (1,256.1)                            | (144.3)                      | 5,582.3              |\n| USD                           | 5,199.9                         | (10.7)                               | (232.3)                      | 4,956.9              |\n| JPY                           | 126.9                           | 129.0                                | (10.7)                       | 245.2                |\n| CNY                           | 445.2                           | (115.2)                              | (339.1)                      | (9.1)                |\n| Other currencies              | 644.3                           | 1,253.0                              | (299.3)                      | 1,598.0              |\n| TOTAL                         | 13,399.0                        | -                                    | (1,025.7)                    | 12,373.3             |\n\n## 24.6.

OTHER FINANCING INFORMATION\n\nFinancial covenants are associated to one bank debt facility exceeding 50 million euros: a long-term loan used by Air Liquide Arabia (Saudi Arabia) with an outstanding amount of 476,6 million Saudi riyals (equivalent to 103,6 million euros) as of December 31, 2020. Financial covenants were all met as of December 31, 2020.\n\nBonds issued by L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Liquide Finance, and making up the carrying amount of bonds as of December 31, 2020, include a change of control clause.\n\nThe amount of bank credit facilities subject to financial covenants represents around 2,7% of the Group's gross debt as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Note/uni00A025  Financial risk policy and management\n\n## 25.1. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk management is a priority for the Group. Consequently, the Finance Department governance relies on Strategic Finance Committees and Operational Finance Committees.\n\nThe Finance Department centrally manages the main financial risks, in accordance with decisions taken by the Strategic Finance Committee to which it reports on a regular basis. The Finance Department also performs country and customer risks analyses associated with investment decisions and attends Investment Committee meetings.\n\nThe financial policy adopted by Air Liquide, the purpose of which is to minimize the risks incurred by the Group and its subsidiaries, enables the Group to ensure sustainable funding sources. To minimize the refinancing risk related to debt maturity schedules, the Group diversifies financing sources and spreads maturities over several years. In 2020, the average debt maturity was 5.8 years. As of December 31, 2020, the long-term debt ratio (gross debt maturing in more than one year / total gross debt) represented 82% of the overall Group debt, compared to 86% as of December 31, 2019.\n\nInterest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies validated by the Operational Finance Committee are set up depending on market opportunities with a concern for optimization, while complying with prudence and risk limitation principles.\n\nThe Group also pays particular attention to its bank and customer counterparty risks by regularly monitoring ratings and the level of risk associated with these counterparties. An internal ratings system, set-up in 2018, is used when no leading credit ratings agency information is available.\n\n## a) Foreign exchange risk\n\n## Principles\n\nFinancial instruments are only used to hedge transaction-based foreign exchange risk. The risk is attached on the one hand to financial cash flows arising from royalties, dividends, intra-group loans and\n\nborrowings denominated in foreign currencies and on the other hand to foreign currency commercial cash flows from operating entities. Although in slight increase, commercial cash flows denominated in foreign currencies do not represent significant amounts compared to consolidated revenue.\n\nForeign exchange risk related to royalties, dividend flows and intra-group loans and borrowings in foreign currencies is hedged by the Central Treasury Department using currency forwards or options with an overall term of less than 18 months. Currency hedging of intra-group loans and borrowings uses currency forwards.\n\nForeign currency commercial cash flows from operating entities are hedged either as part of the annual budgetary process for subsidiaries with recurring flows in foreign currency or at the signing date of a sale or purchase contract for non-recurring flows for the Engineering & Construction business line. Around a hundred subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange risk. These subsidiaries mainly use currency forwards set up by Air Liquide Finance (internal counterparty for hedging transactions) except in countries where it is prohibited by local regulations. The majority of these contracts have short maturities (three to twelve months) and market transactions are regulated by master agreements of the French Banking Federation ('FBF') or by master agreements of the International Swaps and Derivative Association ('ISDA') for local hedging operations.\n\nWhen preparing their budget at the year-end, subsidiaries report their foreign exchange risk exposure to the Central Treasury Department in order to hedge the commercial cash flows expected in the following year. In each case, the Central Treasury Department monitors the adequacy of the hedges with the identified risks and performs a full revaluation of all hedges, every six months.\n\nThe foreign exchange translation risk (consolidation in euros of the assets and liabilities in currencies) was not subject to hedging. Indeed, investments are essentially funded in the currency in which the cash flows are generated, thus creating a natural currency hedging.",

Regarding other currencies, the Finance Department provides subsidiaries with advice as to the different types of bank loans and/or hedging transactions to enter into according to the characteristics of local financial markets.\n\nThe Group policy is to maintain the major portion of total debt at fixed rates and to protect the residual balance using optional hedging instruments. This approach enables the Group to limit the effect of interest rate fluctuations on financial expenses.\n\nConsequently, at the 2020 year-end, 95% of the total debt was fixed-rate debt. The fixed-rate/floating-rate breakdown is reviewed on a regular basis by the Finance Committees, depending on interest rate fluctuations and the level of Group debt.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on floating-rate debt\n\nThe Group net debt exposed to interest rate fluctuations amounted to around 240 million equivalent euros as of December 31, 2020, for an average outstanding amount of 0.6 billion equivalent euros (total debt adjusted for interest rate hedging instruments and short-term securities) in slight increase compared to December 31, 2019 (0.5 billion equivalent euros).\n\nAn increase or decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points (\u00b11%) on all yield curves would have an effect of approximately \u00b16 million euros on the Group's annual financial expenses before tax, assuming outstanding debt remains constant.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on derivatives and their underlying hedged items\n\nThe table below shows the effect of a 0.5% fluctuation of interest rates in all foreign currencies on the interest rate derivatives portfolio in the Group's net profit and equity, as of December 31, 2020.\n\n|                                                             | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                             | +0,5%                | +0,5%                | -0,5%                | -0,5%                |\n| (in millions of euros)                                      | P&L impact           | Equity impact        | P&L impact           | Equity impact        |\n| Interest rate derivatives and their hedged underlying items | 0.0                  | 16.9                 | 0.0                  | (17.4)               |",

The effect on equity primarily stems from the fixed-rate hedging instruments contracted by the subsidiary Air Liquide Finance.\n\n## c) Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risks for Air Liquide potentially include customers and bank counterparties.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries serve a large number of customers (around 2 million worldwide) located in extremely diverse markets: chemicals, steel, refining, food, pharmaceuticals, metals, automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, research laboratories, photovoltaic, etc. In 2020, the Group's main customer represents around 1.4% of revenue, the Group's 10 main customers around 10% of sales, and the Group's 50 main customers around 24% of sales. The geographical risk is limited by the Group's sustainable coverage in 78 countries on all continents. This diversity reduces customer and market risk.\n\nTo better assess its exposure, the Group has implemented procedures to regularly monitor the financial situation of its major customers as well as a monthly reporting for the Group's 176 main transnational customers in order to monitor the related consolidated risk.\n\nMoreover, customer risk assessment and in particular the quality of the customer's site is an important component of the investment decision process.\n\nBank counterparty risk relates to the outstanding amounts of deposits, market values of derivatives and to the credit lines contracted with each bank. Pursuant to its financial policy, in the majority of cases, the Group requires a long-term Standard & Poor's 'A' credit rating or a Moody's 'A2' rating from its counterparties to accept commitments\n\non financial instruments. The Group's credit lines are also spread among several banks from various geographical areas to avoid the risk of concentration while complying with the same credit rating requirements. The Operational Finance Committee regularly reviews and approves the list of bank counterparties related to investments and the list of financial instruments. With regards to short-term investments, outstandings are subject to strict limits per counterparty and are monitored daily.\n\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement specifies that the valuation of currency, interest rate and commodity hedging instruments must take into account the counterparty credit risk attached to these transactions. Considering the aforementioned counterparty selection criteria, the effect on the periodic valuations, by applying the historical default probabilities method is immaterial.\n\n## d) Liquidity risk\n\nIt is Group financial policy to spread over time the maturity of long-term debt in order to avoid concentration of annual refinancing needs. Liquidity risk is also reduced by the stability of cash flows generated from operations as well as by having confirmed credit lines in place. The financial covenants attached to the current financing arrangements described in note 24.7 do not affect the Group's access to liquidity.\n\nThe carrying amount of short-term financing in the form of commercial paper amounted to 202 million euros as of December 31, 2020, an increase by 11 million euros compared to the end of 2019. The average amount of commercial paper amounted to 970 million euros in 2020, compared to 763 million euros in 2019; this increase in the use of commercial paper is directly in line with the prudential will to increase liquidity during the Covid-19 crisis and the diversification of funding sources.\n\nThe Group policy requires that commercial paper in issue be backed by confirmed long-term credit lines. In 2020, this requirement was met, with an amount of confirmed credit lines of 3,600 million euros largely exceeding outstanding commercial paper.\n\nThe table below presents the maturities of the bilateral and syndicated credit lines:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                      | 2021    |   2022 |   2023 | 2024 2025   | 2026   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|---------|\n| Bilateral lines and syndicated credit lines | - 400.0 |    200 |    500 | 2,500.0     | -      | 3,600.0 |\n\nOn December 2020, the second one-year extension option was exercised on the syndicated credit facility negotiated in 2018. The syndicated credit facility amounts to 2.5 billion euros and will mature in December 2025. Since 2019, this facility includes an indexing mechanism between its financial costs and three of the Group's RSE objectives in terms of carbon intensity, gender diversity and safety.\n\nWhen the Group makes short-term financial investments other than bank deposits, it systematically favors monetary instruments with a short-term maturity in order to limit the risk of non-liquidity or high volatility.\n\nThe following tables represent the future cash flows related to the\n\nmain balance sheet items and to the derivative financial instruments recognized at the end of the last two periods. Interest flows are calculated in accordance with IFRS 7 and represent the interest payable for each relevant period. Interest flows related to floating interest rate or foreign currency instruments were calculated using the closing interest and exchange rates as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. The flows related to debt repayment obligations differ from the amounts recognized in the Group's balance sheet due to the accounting treatment applied to borrowings and the exclusion of hedging instruments.",

As Air Liquide does not purchase electricity or natural gas for speculation or arbitrage on commodity price trends purposes, no forward contracts relating to energy meet the definition of a derivative instrument. The contracts enter into as part of the Company's normal business to be used in the industrial process and do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument.\n\nFurthermore, in a global context of highly volatile electricity and natural gas market prices, Air Liquide continues to index long-term customer contracts to hedge these risks. For natural gas and electricity prices, the opening of some markets led the Group, under these circumstances, to replace the regulated tariffs by local market indices.\n\nNonetheless, a few isolated contracts remain for which price indexation alone cannot guarantee a total and effective hedge against the risk of energy prices fluctuations. These risks are therefore hedged by Air Liquide, particularly by Air Liquide Finance, using adequate commodity derivatives, which are mainly swaps with maturities of generally less than two years.\n\nThe fair value recognition of these derivative instruments had no material impact on Group equity or profits as of December 31, 2020.",

In consideration, Exeltium and its shareholder clients signed long-term electricity supply contracts. The contract signed by Air Liquide has a 20-year term and can be suspended by Air Liquide after 10 years. This contract provides long-term visibility over the price of the electricity to be supplied. This project was approved by the European Commission.\n\nThe Group's energy purchase commitments amounted to 1,155.3 million euros as of December 31, 2020 (1,261.1 million euros as of December 31, 2019). This amount includes the energy purchase commitments relating to the Exeltium contract.\n\n## Note/uni00A030  Contingent liabilities\n\nTo the best of the Group's knowledge, there is no exceptional event or litigation which has affected in the recent past or which is likely to materially affect its financial situation or profitability.\n\nIn September 2010, the Brazilian competition authority ('CADE') fined the major industrial gas companies operating in Brazil, including Air Liquide Brazil, for unfair trade practices prior to 2004. Air Liquide Brazil was fined 197.6 million Brazilian reals before interest on arrears amounting to 179.7 million Brazilian reals as of December 31, 2020 (equivalent to 31.0 million euros for the fine and 28.2 million euros for interest on arrears).\n\nAlmost all of these commitments are covered by mutual commitments received from clients in connection with long-term gas supply contracts. These commitments are not disclosed in the table above.\n\nCommitments to purchases of molecules as part of take-or-pay contracts amounted to 3,868.5 million euros as of December 31, 2020 (4,461.5 as of December 31, 2019), and are reported in other commitments related to operating activities. These amounts include Helium purchase commitments.\n\nConfirmed credit lines are shown in note 25.\n\nCommitments related to associates amounted to 42.6 million euros as of December 31, 2020.\n\nAir Liquide Brazil has strongly contested this decision and has consequently filed an application to annul the fine before the Brasilia Federal Court. In May 2014, the CADE ruling was annulled in first instance by this Court. In September 2014, the CADE filed an appeal against this decision, which was rejected by the Court of Appeals in November 2015. In November 2016, the CADE and the Procurator's Office had both filed a new appeal against this decision to the Superior Court and the Supreme Court of Justice, which is still to be ruled as of December 31, 2020. At this stage, the Group considers it probable that Air Liquide Brazil will prevail, mainly following appeals filed by the CADE against other companies and dismissed by the Superior Court. Consequently, no provision has been recorded.",

The main climate risk identified by the Group relates to greenhouse gas emissions. The costs incurred for measures related to gas emissions are already taken into account as part of the investment decision and in the running costs of the Group's plants. These costs are passed on to most of the Large Industrie customers in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\nThe ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) European Directive which established a quota system for greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union has entered its third phase (2013-2020), which will feature an expanded scope for industrial plants subject to the ETS and a gradual reduction in the free allocation of quotas.\n\n## Note/uni00A032  Post-balance sheet events\n\nThere are no significant post-balance sheet events.\n\n## Foreign exchange rates and main consolidated companies\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES\n\n## Main foreign exchange rates used\n\n## Average rates\n\n| Euros for 1 currency   |   2019 |   2020 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| USD                    |   0.89 |   0.88 |\n| CNY                    |   0.13 |   0.13 |\n| CAD                    |   0.67 |   0.65 |\n| Yen (1,000)            |   8.2  |   8.22 |\n\n## Closing rates\n\n| Euros for 1 currency   |   2019 |   2020 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| USD                    |   0.89 |   0.81 |\n| CNY                    |   0.13 |   0.12 |\n| CAD                    |   0.69 |   0.64 |\n| Yen (1,000)            |   8.2  |   7.91 |\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nWith phase III, the Group is required to obtain CO2 quotas for the portion of emissions from hydrogen production sites not covered by free allocations, as well as for all emissions from cogeneration sites. As the Group manages CO2 quotas solely to cover its industrial needs, they are classified as a commodity and managed as such. The quotas are therefore valued at acquisition cost and presented in inventories.\n\nThe Group recognizes a provision when the year-end quotas covering greenhouse gas emissions are insufficient, based on the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to settle the obligation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the amounts recognized in assets and liabilities are immaterial.",

This statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L' Air Liquide,\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of L'Air Liquide ('the Group') for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Large Industries activity: qualification of the contracts and related revenue recognition method\n\n## Risk identified\n\nThe gas supply of the Large Industries activity is based on long term contracts with a limited number of customers and requires significant industrial investments.\n\nAs described in note '3.a. Revenue recognition - Gas & Services' to the consolidated financial statements, these investments are usually made to share production capacity with the other business lines of the Group, particularly the Industrial Merchant business or to serve customers connected to pipelines in an industrial region. In such cases, Group management considers that those assets are not identified as defined in the standard IFRS 16 'Leases'.",

Accordingly, gas supply agreements linked to those assets are not considered as leases. These industrial investments continue to be controlled by the Group and are recorded as property, plant and equipment, the full amounts received for the contracts being, otherwise, recognized as revenue. Customers of the Large Industries business simultaneously receive and consume the benefits granted by the gas supply service or its availability. As a result, the revenue recognition related to these contracts occurs when the gas is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available.\n\nDue to the complexity of those contracts and the impact on the consolidated financial statements of the judgments made when the contract is signed, or in case of subsequent significant modifications, we have considered the qualification of Large Industries long-term contracts and related revenue recognition criteria as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- \u25a0 considering the criteria to qualify the Large Industries long term contracts applied by Group management, considering in particular the specific nature of the underlying assets;\n- \u25a0 considering internal control procedures implemented by Group management to confirm the compliance of these contracts with standard terms and conditions on which Group management's IFRS 16 analysis is based;\n- \u25a0 assessing the compliance to standard terms of the new significant contracts of the current year for the Large Industries activity and conditions and the impact of potential deviations on the accounting treatment;\n- \u25a0 verifying the appropriateness of the disclosure included in note '3.a. Revenue recognition - Gas & Services' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Large Industries activity: useful lives of production units and measurement of their recoverable amount\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the net book value of property, plant and equipment amounts to 20,003 million euros, or 47.7% of the Group total assets, that include the significant industrial investments to execute the customer agreements of the Large Industries activity. Large Industries production units are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life, usually between 15 and 20 years. The estimated useful lives are reassessed on a regular basis and the resulting changes in estimates, if any, are recorded on a prospective basis.\n\nIn addition, the Group can be exposed to certain risks specific to industrial investments. Expected returns on investment and their recoverable value can, for example, be adversely impacted by events such as the economic context, overruns and construction delays, start-up conditions, technology changes, geographical location or counterparty risk.\n\nAs disclosed in note '5.f. Impairment of assets' to the consolidated financial statements, Group management determines on a regular basis whether asset impairment indicators exist. If a triggering event is identified, an impairment test is performed to confirm whether the net book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value. These principles lead Group management to test production assets (either individually or within the cash generating unit to which they are attached), in particular in case of significant start-up delays, project termination, significant decrease in expected business volumes, early termination or non-renewal of related customer contracts.\n\nAs part of the preparation of its medium-term plan, the Group has carried out a strategic review of its activities and its assets portfolio, taking into account the impacts of the health crisis on specific markets. The measurement of the recoverable value of the equipment relies on significant estimates relating to the Group's capacity to generate future cash-flows, re-use certain equipment for other internal or external customers, to sell the assets, or to obtain indemnification, notably from customers.\n\nDue to the significant value of each production asset and the cumulative value of these assets, the key assumptions used to assess their useful life, their re-use or the compensation to be received, we have considered the depreciation principles and measurement of the recoverable value of Large Industries production assets as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- \u25a0 considering the procedures performed by Group management to assess and update the depreciation period of the equipment and assess the consistency of their useful lives with contractual terms and available internal technical studies ;\n- \u25a0 analyzing the Group's process to identify impairment indicators and considering the strategic review of its activities and its assets portfolio performed by Group management ;\n- \u25a0 considering the work carried out by the Group to determine the recoverable values of the plants, including key assumptions and estimates used to determine the future cash flows and reconciling them to the underlying operational data and to the long-term growth rate of these cash flows ;\n- \u25a0 verifying the accounting translation of impairment losses resulting from the determination of recoverable values ;\n- \u25a0 considering discussions of the Group with its customers and advisors.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment test of goodwill\n\n## Risk identified\n\nIn connection with its external growth strategy, the Group monitors the related goodwill at the level of group of cash generating units. For the Gas & Services activity, goodwill are mostly allocated on a geographical basis. For the world business units Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies, goodwill is monitored at the business unit level. As at December 31, 2020, goodwill amounts to a net book value of 13,087 million euros (31.2% of the Group total assets).\n\nGroup management performs annually, an impairment test, mostly by reference to market values and, if required, with discounted cash-flows as described in note '5.f. Impairment of assets' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of fair value and recoverable value, and the sensitivity to the fluctuation of market value and key data and assumptions used, require significant management judgement and estimates. We have considered the measurement of the recoverable value of the groups of cash generating units as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- \u25a0 considering the principles used to determine the groups of cash generating units ;\n- \u25a0 analyzing principles and methods used to determine the market value and their measurement based on multiples of market capitalization ;\n- \u25a0 considering in particular for cash generating units (or groups of cash generating units) subject to a value in use valuation, management key assumptions and estimates, notably the underlying operating data and long-term growth rates of the cash-flow. We have also assessed with the support of our valuation experts who are part of the audit team, the discount rates applied and performed sensitivity tests ;\n- \u25a0 assessing the appropriateness of the information included in note '10. Goodwill' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the Group's Management Report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the Group's information given in the Management Report, being specified that, in accordance with Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and the information has to be subject to a report by an independent third party.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nIn accordance with Article 222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the Company's management informed us of its decision to postpone the presentation of the consolidated financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic format as defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 to years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Therefore, this report does not include a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code mon\u00e9taire et financier).\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of L'Air Liquide by the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2016 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 5, 2010 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its fifth year of uninterrupted engagement and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its eleventh year of uninterrupted engagement. Previously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit was statutory auditor of L'Air Liquide from 1983 to 2009.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Consolidated financial statements",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25a0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u25a0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u25a0 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25a0 Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u25a0 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La-D\u00e9fense, March 1, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nPricewaterHouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nFran\u00e7oise Garnier\n\nS\u00e9verine Scheer\n\nJeanne Boillet\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Guillaume Postel",

General principles\n\nThe year-end financial statements of L'Air Liquide S.A. have been prepared in accordance with general accounting principles applicable in France and in particular those of the French Chart of Accounts (Plan Comptable G\u00e9n\u00e9ral) and the French Commercial Code.\n\n## 2. Non-current assets\n\n## A.  Intangible assets\n\nInternally generated intangible assets primarily include the development costs of information management systems. They are capitalized only if they generate probable future economic benefits. Internal and external costs corresponding to detailed application design, programming, the performance of tests and the drafting of technical documentation intended for internal or external use are capitalized.\n\nSignificant upgrade and improvement costs are added to the initial cost of assets if they specifically meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nOther intangible assets include separately acquired intangible assets such as software, licenses and intellectual property rights and are measured at acquisition cost.\n\nIntangible assets are amortized according to the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## B.  Tangible assets\n\nLand, buildings and equipment are recognized at historical cost. Interim interest expense is not included in the cost.\n\nWhere components of a tangible asset have different useful lives, they are accounted separately and depreciated over their own useful lives.\n\nDepreciation is computed according to the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 10 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 equipment: 5 to 20 years.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## C.  Impairment of intangible and tangible assets\n\nThe Company assesses at each closing date whether there is any indication of impairment loss of intangible and tangible assets. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its present value, which is defined as the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value as this would be done for an investment decision.\n\nWhen the present amount of an asset is lower than its net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. When the present value exceeds the carrying amount, the previously recognized impairment is reversed to the income statement.\n\n## D.  Equity investments\n\nEquity investments are recognized at their initial amount on the entry date, with the exception of those subject to a revaluation as provided by Law 76-1232 of December 29, 1976. Acquisition costs that are not representative of market value are expensed.\n\n## Statutory accounts of the parent company\n\nWhen the carrying amount, determined using the criteria normally adopted for the measurement of equity investments (market multiples method based on the Air Liquide group market valuation, estimated cash flow approach, and net asset value remeasured at fair value), is lower than the book value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\n\n## E.  Treasury shares\n\nWhen the Company purchases its own shares, they are recognized at cost as treasury shares in other long-term investment securities. The gains or losses on disposals of treasury shares contribute to the net profit for the year.\n\nHowever, shares allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are reclassified to a 'Short-term financial investments - Company treasury shares' caption at the balance sheet value on the date of allotment.\n\nA provision is recorded over the rights vesting period to cover the future charge of employees and members of Executive Management of the Company relating to the remittance of current shares when the performance criteria can be determined with reliability. Conversely, the amount corresponding to the maximum performance level is presented in off-balance sheet commitments.\n\nWhen the purchase cost of shares is higher than their valuation based on the average share price during the last month of the fiscal year, treasury shares earmarked for cancellation or allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are not impaired.\n\n## 3. Inventories and work-in-progress\n\nRaw materials, supplies and goods are primarily measured at weighted average cost.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for inventories and work-in-progress when the estimated realizable amount is lower than cost.\n\n## 4. Trade receivables and other operating assets\n\nTrade receivables and other operating assets are measured at historical cost.\n\nAn impairment loss for receivables is recognized when it becomes probable that the amount due will not be collected and the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## 5. Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.\n\nAt year-end, the difference arising from the translation of receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency, are recognized in suspense accounts in assets and liabilities ('Unrealized foreign currency gains or losses').\n\nWhere applicable, unrealized foreign exchange losses associated with non-hedged transactions are subject to a contingency provision.",

Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event or an ongoing one;\n- \u25a0 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n## 7. Financial instruments\n\nSince January 1, 2017, L'Air Liquide S.A. has applied the ANC regulation no. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 related to financial forward and hedging instruments.\n\nIn accordance with its risk management policy, L'Air Liquide S.A. enters into forward currency purchases or sales in order to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with transactions carried out in foreign currencies.\n\nBy symmetry, the foreign exchange gains or losses on forward currency purchases or sales is presented at the same time and in the same income statement caption as the hedged item.\n\nLikewise, the unrealized gain from the hedging is presented within the unrealized foreign currency gains or losses statement caption, to offset the exchange differentials related to the revaluation of underlying receivables and debts. When the forward currency purchases or sales, hedge future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet, the fair value of these instruments represents an off balance sheet commitment.\n\nWhere applicable, when the financial instruments used do not constitute hedging transactions ('isolated open position'), the losses resulting from their year-end market value are provided for in the income statement. In accordance with the principle of prudence, unrealized gains are not recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 8. Post-employment benefits\n\nThe Company applies ANC recommendation 2013-02 related to the recognition and measurement of retirement benefits and similar obligations.\n\nThe Company provides its employees with various pension plans, termination benefits, jubilees (awards based on years of service) and other post-employment benefits for both active employees and retirees. These benefits are covered in two ways:\n\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Company grants both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole obligation is to pay regular contributions. The employer does not grant any guarantee on the future level of benefits paid to the employee or retiree ('means-based obligation'). The annual pension expense is equal to the contribution paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation.\n\nDefined benefit plans are those by which the employer guarantees the future level of benefits defined in the agreement, most often depending on the employee's salary and seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either financed by contributions to a fund specialized in managing the contributions paid;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn the case of defined benefit plans, retirement and similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take into account the following assumptions: salary increases, employee turnover, retirement date, mortality, inflation and appropriate discount rates.\n\nActuarial gains and losses exceeding the greater of 10% of the obligations or 10% of the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the reporting period are amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants.\n\nIn accordance with the option offered by ANC recommendation 2013-02, the Company maintained its previous practices: obligations related to retirement termination payments and jubilees are provided whereas other retirement obligations related to defined benefit plans are not provided but are disclosed in the notes.\n\n## 9. Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.\n\nRevenue associated with delivery of services is booked when delivery is completed.\n\n## 10. Tax consolidation\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A. has set up a tax consolidation group with the French subsidiaries in which it holds a direct or indirect interest exceeding 95%, as defined by article 223-A of the French General Tax Code.\n\nEach company calculates its tax provision as if it was taxed separately. L'Air Liquide S.A., as head of the tax consolidation group, recognizes as an expense the tax corresponding to its own profits and recognizes in a balance sheet current tax account the impact of restatements and eliminations when determining taxable profit as a whole and the tax deferrals of subsidiaries with losses. It is booked in exceptional income and expenses according to the Opinion 2005-G of the emergency committee of the C.N.C.\n\n## 11. Research and Development expenditures\n\nDevelopment costs shall be recognized as assets if and only if the Company can demonstrate all of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 the project is clearly identified and the related costs are individualized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the technical and industrial feasibility of the project is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and use or sell the products arising from it;\n- \u25a0 it is probable that the project will generate future economic benefits for the Company.\n\nWhen these conditions are not satisfied, the work carried out does not systematically result in the completion of an intangible asset that will be available for use or sale, development costs generated are recognized as an expense when incurred.",

Significant events\n\nIn 2019, there were no significant events during the fiscal year.\n\nIn 2020: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a worldwide health emergency due to the propagation of the covid-19 virus and designated it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Consequently, governments from all over the world have been forced to adopt social and economic restrictive measures in order to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nThese measures have significantly affected the worldwide economy.\n\nThe impact of this pandemic on the Company's accounts is mainly reflected in the overall decrease in the royalties collected from subsidiaries (-41.5 million euros of which -7.6 million are related to currency effects).\n\n## 2. Revenue breakdown by geographical area\n\n| (in millions of euros)   |   2019 |   2020 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| France                   |   74.5 |   44.5 |\n| Abroad                   |   42.9 |   42.3 |\n| REVENUE                  |  117.4 |   86.8 |\n\nBy the nature of its activities, the revenue of L'Air Liquide S.A. mainly corresponds to services and pension expenses recharged to its subsidiaries (see note 16.A).\n\nIn 2020, the Company reviewed the billing terms of the Group retirement benefit guarantee agreement granted to its subsidiaries, regarding employee pension payments. This resulted in a 26.4 million euros decrease of the revenue.\n\n## 3. Royalties and other operating income\n\nOther operating income mainly includes change in inventories of goods and services, production of assets capitalized, operating subsidies, operating expense reclassifications, as well as operating provision and impairment reversals.\n\n## 4. Other operating expenses\n\nOther operating expenses primarily consist of research and development costs and other external expenses such as subcontracting and maintenance costs, fees, travel expenses, telecommunication costs and rental expenses.\n\n## 5. Depreciation, amortization and provision expenses\n\nDepreciation, amortization and provision expenses break down as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                            | 2019   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Depreciation and amortization expenses            | (15.7) | (13.5) |\n| Provision expenses                                | (14.1) | (12.7) |\n| DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND PROVISION EXPENSES | (29.8) | (26.2) |\n\n## 6.

KG paid an exceptional dividend of 820.0 million euros.\n\nInterests, similar income and expenses break down as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                     | 2019   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenues from long-term loans and other financial revenues | 24.6   | 19.1   |\n| Other interest and similar income                          | (15.9) | (13.0) |\n| INTERESTS, SIMILAR INCOME AND EXPENSES                     | 8.7    | 6.1    |\n\nOther financial income and expenses break down as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                               |   2019 | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Other financial expenses, impairment and provisions net of reversals |    0.8 | 4.2    |\n| Foreign exchange gains / losses (net)                                |    0.2 | (0.6)  |\n| OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES                                  |    1   | 3.6    |",

On September 19, 2014, the Company appealed the decision of the Administrative Court of Montreuil regarding the recovery of the balance. On appeal, the Administrative Court of Versailles partially sided with Air Liquide on July 7, 2020. Following this decision, Air Liquide received 31.8 million of euros in principal and 23.1 million of euros in interest on arrears on July 27, 2020.\n- Following the decisions rendered by the Court of Appeal of Versailles and in order to challenge some of those decisions, Air Liquide and the tax administration have filed a plea before the Supreme Court ('Conseil d'\u00c9tat'). On October 23, the Conseil d'\u00c9tat decided to refer a question to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Financial instruments\n\nUnsettled derivatives as of December 31, 2020 break down as follows:\n\n|                        | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Carrying value      | Fair value          |\n| Currency forwards      |                     |                     |\n| n Buy                  | 38.2                | (0.8)               |\n| n Sell                 | 173.4               | 3.7                 |\n| FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK  |                     | 2.9                 |\n\nThe fair value difference represents the difference between the derivative valuation and the value of the contract determined at the closing year-end exchange rate.\n\nAll of these instruments are allocated to hedging. There is therefore no isolated open position whose change in fair value would have a direct impact on the income statement.\n\n## 16. Retirement and similar plans\n\n## A.  Group retirement benefit guarantee agreement\n\nIn France, Air Liquide grants additional benefits to retirees (3,540 retirees as of December 31, 2020) and to employees over 45, or with more than 20 years of service as of January 1, 1996 (one employee as of December 31, 2020). These benefits provide a supplemental retirement income based on final pay, which is paid in addition to other normal retirement benefits. This plan is closed to employees under the age 45, or with less than 20 years of service as of January 1, 1996. These plans are unfunded. The annual amount paid with regards to additional benefits cannot exceed originally 12% of total payroll or, in some case, 12% of pre-tax profits of companies involved. This 12% threshold will be proportionately reduced by comparing the number of plan beneficiaries for the year to the number of plan beneficiaries for the previous year. In 2017, this additional benefit was funded subsequently to the article 50 of the law of January 20, 2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nIn October 2020, the Company reviewed the billing terms of the Group retirement benefit guarantee agreement granted to its subsidiaries, regarding employee pension payments.\n\nThe contributions amounted to 20.1 million euros in 2020 (11.2 million euros in 2019) after reinvoicing subsidiaries. Excluding the impact of timelines, and until the plan ends, the actuarial value of obligations vis-\u00e0-vis retirees and those eligible as of December 31, 2020 amounts to 603.1 million euros.\n\nBased on the assumptions used for the valuation of the retirement obligations, an estimated 310.7 million euros will be recharged to the subsidiaries of L'Air Liquide S.A. as and when benefits are paid to the retirees.\n\n## B.  Externally funded plan\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A. grants to employees not covered by the preceding plan (1,009 employees as of December 31, 2020) and with at least one half-year of service benefit from an externally funded defined contribution plan. Contributions to this plan are jointly paid by the employer and employee. For 2020, employer contributions amounted to 6.9 million euros (7.9 million euros in 2019).\n\n## C.  Retirement termination payments and jubilees\n\nThe corresponding obligations are provided for in the amount of 26.6 million euros (net of tax) and 0.9 million euros, respectively.\n\n## D.  Calculation of actuarial assumptions and methods\n\nThe calculations with respect to the Group's retirement benefit guarantee agreement, retirement termination payments and jubilees are performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.\n\nActuarial gains and losses exceeding the greater of 10% of the obligations related to retirement termination payments and unrecognized past service costs are amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants. As of December 31, 2020, the amounts stand at 20.8 million euros (18.5 million euros in 2019).\n\nThe actuarial assumptions (turnover, mortality, retirement age, salary increase) vary according to demographic and economic conditions.\n\nThe discount rates used to determine the present value of obligations are based on Government bonds or High-quality Corporate bonds, with the same duration as the obligations at the valuation date (0.60% as of December 31, 2020).",

Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes arise from timing differences between the tax regime and the accounting treatment of income and expenses. According to the nature of the differences, these deferred taxes will increase or decrease the future tax expense and are not recorded pursuant to the provisions of the chart of accounts.\n\nDeferred taxes as of December 31, 2020 are estimated as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                    | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Deferred tax assets (decrease in future tax expense)      | 3.8                 | 2.7                 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities (increase in future tax expense) | -                   | -                   |\n\nThe deferred taxes were calculated taking into account the 3.3% social security contribution on earnings i.e. a general rate of 32.02% in 2019 and 28.41% in 2020.",

This statutory auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the Management Report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L' Air Liquide,\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of L'Air Liquide for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2020  to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Equity investements measurement\n\n## Identified risk\n\n## Our audit response\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, the net book value of the equity investments amounts to \u20ac12,437 million and represents 86.9% of the total balance sheet. Equity investments are recognized at their initial consideration, excluding acquisition costs and after considering legal reevaluation if any. As disclosed in note '2.D. Accounting policies - Equity investments' to the statutory financial statements, when the carrying amount (determined applying the market multiples method based on the Group market capitalization or the estimated cash flows method  or the method of net asset value re-measured at fair value) is lower than the net book value of the equity investment, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference\n\nThe selection of the method used to determine the carrying amount requires significant Management judgement.\n\nDue to the significant equity investments balance and the impact of the method retained to determine the carrying amount, we have considered that the measurement of the equity investments as a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- n assessing,  based  on  information  provided  by  Management, valuation methods applied by the Company;\n- n assessing assumptions used to determine the re-measured net asset;\n- n assessing the methodology and the results of the tests performed based on the Group market capitalization;\n- n verifying the information included in notes '2.D. Accounting policies - Equity investments', '10. Financial assets' and '11. Impairment, allowances and provisions' to the statutory financial statements.",

Previously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit,  was statutory auditor of L'Air Liquide from 1983 to 2009.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25a0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u25a0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u25a0 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25a0 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee, which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La-D\u00e9fense, March 1, 2021\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nPricewaterHouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nFran\u00e7oise Garnier\n\nS\u00e9verine Scheer\n\nJeanne Boillet\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Guillaume Postel",

As part of its business strategy, the Group has set the following sustainable development objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 prevent global warming and improve air quality;\n- \u25a0 strengthen dialog with all its stakeholders.\n\nThis Universal Registration Document strives to comply with the various principles that respectively govern the (EU) Regulation 2017/1129 of June 14, 2017 ('Prospectus III Regulation'), the Vigilance Plan and the Extra-financial performance declaration (EFPD) as follows:\n\nChapter 1 sets out the Group's integrated strategy, its business model, and its financial, environmental and societal performance.\n\n## Chapter 2 includes:\n\n- \u25a0 a description of risk factors that are material and specific to the issuer and associated management measures, covered in article 16 of Prospectus III Regulation;\n- \u25a0 the mapping of risks specific to the duty of vigilance (as defined by the article L. 225-102-4 of the French commercial code) supplements the company's own mapping, identifying risks that the company could pose to individuals (concerning respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety) and to the environment. The most serious risks are identified so that they can be addressed as a priority by implementing preventive, mitigating or remedial measures (page 97);\n\nThe Extra-financial Performance Declaration (EFPD), as defined in article L. 22-10-36 para. 1 of the French Commercial Code and published in Chapter 5, sets out the main gross extra-financial risks for the Group and the associated mitigating policies. Some of these risks fall within the requirements of the Prospectus 3 Regulation and are included in the Risk Factors and Management Measures section of Chapter 2 of this Universal registration document.\n\nJust like the Annual Financial Report, the Environmental and Societal reporting is reviewed each year by an independent verifier. Audits by independent verifiers conducted in 2020 covered 30% of the workforce and 20% of the Group's environmental footprint (a) .\n\nFor further information, the Group's website has a section dedicated to Sustainable Development.

Some of these risks also relate to criteria in the Prospectus 3 regulation, and as such are presented in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document;\n- \u25a0 the policies and procedures implemented to prevent and mitigate these risks (Chapter 5);\n- \u25a0 the results of these policies and key performance indicators (Chapter 5).\n\nIn the Extra-financial Performance Declaration, the main risks and issues were identified by the Sustainable Development Department in partnership with the Legal, Financial, Human Resources and Risks departments. Some of them appear in the Group's overall risks map and have been reviewed by the Board of Directors.\n\nMoreover, in identifying these risks and challenges, Air Liquide also takes into account a dual materiality perspective:\n\n- \u25a0 their internal impact, i.e. on the Group's performance and development;\n- \u25a0 their external impact taking into account the assessment of its stakeholders.\n\nIn order to integrate the main risks and opportunities into the Group's strategy, according to the importance given to them by the various stakeholders, Air Liquide updated the materiality matrix of its sustainable development stakes in 2020. The results of this process are presented in this chapter (page 322).\n\nIt is structured around corporate, environmental and social stakes.\n\nThrough its business and commitment, Air Liquide contributes to reaching certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced by the UN to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. To illustrate this contribution, initiatives by the Group - described in the EFPD - are associated with the relevant SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE PROTECTS LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT\n\nMany industrial and medical gas applications protect the environment on the sites of Group customers and life at the homes of Group patients. These applications accounted for over 40% of Group revenue in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\n## 1. Social stakes\n\n## 1.1. HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\n## 1.1.1. Health and Safety Risks\n\nHealth and Safety risks form part of the Group's industrial risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page 76), which are associated with the various products, industrial processes and distribution methods in use. Air Liquide's various business lines involve more specific risks associated with products and processes, and how they are operated.\n\n## 1.1.2. Policy and procedures\n\nSafety is an integral part of Air Liquide's operational excellence and culture. The Group is committed to effectively and in all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, customers, subcontractors, suppliers and local communities to occupational and industrial risks. Commitment to safety is total, visible and accompanied by unshakable vigilance.\n\nPrevention, protection, early detection and rapid reaction are at the heart of the Group's concerns. This commitment is reiterated in the General Statement of Air Liquide's Principles of Action. These Principles are shared with all entities and are available on the Group's website (https://www.airliquide.com/group/groups-principles-action).\n\nEvery subsidiary is committed to achieving the 'zero accidents' ambition, as well as the objective of continuously improving its safety performance.\n\n## The safety of individuals\n\nSafety is a collective commitment and the responsibility of each individual. Being aware of dangers and risks, applying the rules and taking care of others - all this contributes to reducing the risk of accidents and strengthening the Group's safety culture. Safety leadership training and on-the-job training courses are regularly organized. Air Liquide's managers encourage safety efforts, demonstrate this commitment on site and reward best practices.\n\nEach employee and subcontractor must be aware of safety rules, follow them and intervene each time there is a risk of hazardous behavior or conditions.\n\nThe Group has drawn up 12 Life-Saving Rules . Given their importance, non-compliance with one of these 12 rules by anyone working for Air Liquide can lead to a warning, or even penalties up to and including suspension.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide uses subcontractors within the course of its business and pays particular attention to the following:\n\n- \u25a0 assessing the level of maturity and performance of safety measures before any sales commitment is made;\n- \u25a0 including safety clauses in the contracts;\n- \u25a0 a work structure with shared, comprehensible and detailed safety instructions;\n- \u25a0 communicating Air Liquide's safety values and standards, as well as the regulations in force that must be followed;\n- \u25a0 being as demanding and stringent with subcontractors as we are with Group employees;\n- \u25a0 supervising subcontractors' safety in the execution of services;\n- \u25a0 safety reviews once the work is complete and sharing feedback.\n\n## Road safety\n\nThe Group's goal is to permanently reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents.\n\nIt uses the following means to achieve these goals:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring that the Group's safety rules are applied by all subsidiaries and service providers;\n- \u25a0 replacing the fleet with safer vehicles;\n- \u25a0 improving the safety of drivers and third parties by introducing the necessary behavioral changes through the implementation of digital alert and support technologies;\n- \u25a0 systematically incorporating feedback from the most serious events, and sharing best practices with all of the Group's subsidiaries and partners;\n- \u25a0 monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of measures implemented by subsidiaries by means of dedicated audits.\n\nAccording to the region, context, current legislation and practices, all or some of the following measures are applied:\n\n- \u25a0 the installation of onboard technologies such as cameras, which can detect driver fatigue and distractions, help change driving habits where necessary, and provide visibility of the vehicle's surroundings;\n- \u25a0 increased dialog on road safety both internally as well as with service providers and other organizations specialized in this subject, both locally and on an international scale. Air Liquide regularly holds transport safety discussion and knowledge-building events with its partners;\n- \u25a0 the organization of special events to recognize road safety performance and promote the sharing of best practices among subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 initiatives which lead to a change in behavior to implement a dynamic culture of road safety among Air Liquide employees and employees of the Group's subcontractors.",

        "page_content": "## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\n## Process safety\n\nProcess safety addresses risks relating to industrial facilities from production to product implementation. It draws on Air Liquide's Industrial Management System (IMS) and requires:\n\n- \u25a0 the identification of specific industrial risks for each business;\n- \u25a0 knowledge of scenarios and their potential consequences;\n- \u25a0 the implementation of appropriate preventative and protective safety measures for each of these risks;\n- \u25a0 the monitoring and analysis of risks relating to new technologies and events arising within the profession;\n- \u25a0 feedback to facilitate learning, awareness-raising, the promotion of a safety culture and to improve prevention.\n\nSince its launch 15 years ago, the IMS has significantly changed and improved the way in which industrial activities are managed. Thanks to employees' commitment to safety, environmental protection and reliability, this system helps us strive towards operational excellence. Its implementation is regularly assessed by specific IMS internal audits.\n\nAs the Group's businesses grow, so do the demands of its customers and their commitment to corporate social responsibility, bringing with them new challenges and opportunities. Building on the experience acquired, a project was therefore launched in 2018 to adapt the IMS. While maintaining the strong fundamentals established since 2005, the protocol was simplified, roles and responsibilities made clearer\n\nand governance strengthened, making the IMS easier to apply to daily operations and therefore even more efficient. New tools, some of which are digital, have been made available to the operating entities. The roll-out to all of the Group's businesses began in 2020 and will continue until mid-2022.\n\n## 1.1.3. Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 'Good health and well-being' and 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\n2020 was profoundly marked by the covid-19 crisis. During these extraordinary times, the lost-time accident frequency rate among Air Liquide employees fell sharply to 0.9 by late 2020  - a 30% improvement over 2019. This is a remarkable improvement which the Group intends to learn from fully in order to maintain the lowest possible rate on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn 2020, the Group recorded the deaths of three people: two Air Liquide employees and one subcontractor. Two occurred while driving, while the third happened in a gas cylinder maintenance shop.\n\nThe Group has made - and will continue to make - every effort to analyze all accidents and draw lessons from them to prevent them from reoccurring.\n\n## LOST-TIME ACCIDENT FREQUENCY RATE AMONG AIR LIQUIDE EMPLOYEES (a) (b)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a)  Number of lost-time accidents of at least one day per million hours worked.\n- (b)  Including Airgas since 2017.",

The frequency rate of preventable serious accidents involving injured persons continues to improve. Unfortunately, Air Liquide suffered two fatal accidents involving an employee and a driver for a subcontractor.\n\nAn analysis of the 2020 events and the identification of causes confirms the identified areas for improvement, which resulted in Air Liquide implementing initiatives to support changes in driving behavior, supported by the use of digital driver assistance technologies. These initiatives have been rolled out across the Group's entire fleet and carrier partners under a five-year plan.\n\n## 1.2. HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\n\n## 1.2.1. Human Resources management related risks\n\nHuman Resources management related risks are part of the Group's business related risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page 80). Working arrangements in an international group like Air Liquide need to be able to adapt to a constantly changing world so that employees can operate in a safe, high-quality working environment and contribute to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nThe long-term performance of Air Liquide is driven, in particular, by the quality of its employees, their skills and their commitment.\n\nIn its businesses, the Group is therefore exposed to the risk of not being able to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the right place, in particular in emerging countries where the Group is expanding its activities, or in regions where the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 develop these skills, in particular with the digitization of certain businesses.\n\nIn addition to risks relating to skills management, psycho-social risks may also affect the health and level of commitment of Group employees, in particular in the recent context where homeworking has been rapidly implemented.\n\n## 1.2.2. Policy and procedures\n\nThe Group is committed to identify, attract and develop the necessary scientific, technical and digital skills required for its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. The Human Resources policy defines the main rules, together with the roles and responsibilities of the different parties in their implementation, with respect to, among others:\n\n- \u25a0 acquiring the acquisition and sustaining of required skills, in particular through the SPRING long-term program, which identifies and manages critical skills;\n- \u25a0 supporting employees in their personal development throughout their career, particularly thanks to a centralized career and skills management tool (TMS: Talent Management System) and the communication of career advancement opportunities (TAS: Talent Acquisition System);\n- \u25a0 measuring and recognizing performance and contributions for all employees. In addition to employee remuneration and loyalty policies (regular capital increases reserved for employees), specific provisions aimed at promoting and sustaining certain skills, such as inventor and entrepreneur recognition programs, the technical expertise development scheme ('Technical Community Leaders').\n\nThe Group ensures the building of a performance-focused, attractive and collaborative professional environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of Group employees in their workplace.\n\nThe growth in homeworking has increased the use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. In the context of new ways of working adjustments, accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, the Group launched the 'Next Normal' worldwide project in 2020 to capitalize on changes to working practices. This will enable entities to provide their employees with a new framework including team management, a supervised remote work policy, redesigned work spaces, and an in-depth review of interactions with customers and patients.\n\nTo promote well-being in the workplace, focus groups have been created with the aim of improving employees' work-life balance. This approach satisfies employees' expectations in this area. These practices are founded on principles co-created with European social partners. In 2019, the Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose is to prevent psychosocial risks. This has led to the creation of a charter based on action principles linked to improvements in work scheduling, workloads and work-life balance.\n\n## 1.2.3. Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 'Good health and well-being'.\n\nAir Liquide University has reinforced its offer of online learning ('e-learning') used by a growing number of users (more than 62,000 in 2020) in a wide variety of fields (ethics, industrial safety, competition law, digital safety, management, etc.). They are the subject of a programme and are managed by a specific learning management system (LMS).\n\nIn 2020, amidst the pandemic crisis, the digital transformation of many business lines and increased training for employees, the University also launched two virtual campuses open to the entire Group, which revolve around four themes: Management & Leadership, Sales & Marketing, Operational Excellence and Innovation. This has resulted in more than 5,900 employees logged in to over 300 online sessions: webinars, virtual classes, online lessons and learning paths. These events have, firstly, promoted interactions within the Group thanks to participants from 74 countries and, secondly, revealed employees'",

Employee feedback is collected each year throughout the Group to better understand their expectations, identify and implement appropriate actions and thus significantly improve their commitment. This level of attention to the employee experience is a key factor in attracting, retaining and developing employees.\n\nAir Liquide is committed to meaningful social dialog in all of its subsidiaries. This may take different forms according to local regulations. In 2020, 81% of Group employees had access to a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nThe performance review meeting is a key stage in employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and their manager on performance and development, the assessment and setting objectives for the year ahead. In 2020, 83% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\n## COVID-19 - MANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC CRISIS BY HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nParticular attention has been paid to the Group's employees and subcontractors during the covid-19 pandemic crisis. Over recent months, a crisis unit has met every week under the authority of the Group's Human Resources Director, producing various protocols for use by all entities, some of which are shown here by way of illustration:\n\n- \u25a0 Covid-19: Recommendations and Business Continuity Plan;\n- \u25a0 Procedure for handling employees who test positive within a critical production entity;\n- \u25a0 Human Resources - How to respond when an employee tests positive for covid-19;\n- \u25a0 Instructions for the transition phase and anticipation of the 'second wave';\n\nTo facilitate the purchase of personal protection masks and other products required for entities' business activities, a number of teams have been assigned the task of specifying requirements and then procuring resources. These ad-hoc structures, with the support of the Group's Procurement Department, have provided a response to subsidiaries' needs.\n\nManagers and executives have worked closely with teams via regular online team meetings (and even face to face, where possible) and discussions with union representatives. Air Liquide has also introduced measures such as a listening and support phone hotline, giving employees an opportunity to share their feelings and prevent exhaustion and disengagement during lockdown.\n\nConsistent Group-wide human resources policies and principles have been introduced during the pandemic. However, Air Liquide Group measures do not replace the legal obligations and measures in force in each country. In addition, the Air Liquide Group has not applied for government assistance in France (furloughing, payment terms, etc.)\n\n## 1.3. DISCRIMINATION\n\n## 1.3.1. Risks associated with discrimination\n\nDiversity is a priority of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy and policy and the Group considers it a source of strength, creativity and performance. It is a fundamental element of the organization, in terms of both businesses and employees, and drives the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThe discrimination risk is part of the Environment and Society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 88).\n\nAir Liquide operates businesses with high technological content in a large number of countries with different cultures. The Group's objective in this regard is to have teams comprising employees who represent the environment in which they operate. Each entity is therefore responsible for implementing action plans specific to its own environment and legal framework, which may include many forms of diversity (skin color, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, etc.).\n\nDiscrimination-related issues, particularly concerning gender diversity (gender disparities, particularly in technical or expert professions), disability and age could affect employees of the Group or of its partners.\n\n## 1.3.2. Policy and procedures\n\nThe objective at a Group level is to increase diversity among managerial staff to better recognize the various cultures that make up Air Liquide and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified targets have been set for the Group and its entities regarding gender and nationalities.\n\nA team within the Human Resources structure is responsible for managing diversity projects. The Group's roadmap is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 deploy diversity objectives at all entities and implement corresponding action plans;\n- \u25a0 improve all of the Group's Human Resources processes to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promote an inclusive culture to leverage the diversity of teams.\n\nInternal audits have been carried out to ensure that entities comply with Human Resources objectives, and to verify the monitoring of indicators and the implementation of action plans.\n\nA team within the Human Resources structure is responsible for managing diversity projects at a Group level. Each hub/business then implements its own roadmap and diversity actions with consideration to its own situation. A number of initiatives are conducted locally every year, such as the introduction of a recruitment process that strengthens the role of women, the creation of networks to promote gender equality, and specific career review meetings for women. A new tool called 'Nudge Lab' was recently launched, based on a behavioral approach, to increase diversity, particularly in senior positions.\n\nThrough its diversity policy, Air Liquide is therefore committed to combating all forms of discrimination.",

These objectives are in line with the results obtained over the past ten years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 26% to 30%;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\nThe ambitious gender diversity objectives set for the 'Managers and Professionals' and 'senior executives' population, and for maintaining the gender diversity goal among the Group's 'high potentials', are also intended to form a talent pool to ensure balanced gender representation on the Executive Committee by promoting female talents to higher levels of management.\n\nIn 2020, women represented 43% of employees considered as high flyers, this level has been increasing regularly for a number of years and must be maintained. The Executive Committee includes five women among its fourteen members. Three of these were appointed in 2019, having previously held executive positions within the Group. Six women are currently members of the Board of Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A., out of a total of eleven members appointed by the General Meeting.\n\nMore generally, and taking the highest level of responsibilities across the Group into account, women hold 20% of the Top 100 positions, and 21% of all positions defined as Executive, over and above the goals set by the Board of Directors for 2020. This latter percentage has increased from 19% to 21% over the last three years.\n\nAmong the 10% of positions with the greatest level of responsibility within the Company (a), 27% of them are held by women; these women have an average age of 51.8 years and a median age of 52.4 years, i.e. 2.4 years and 2.8 years less respectively than the average age (54.2 years) and median age (55.2 years) for men. This difference is due to the policy to promote women to the highest levels of responsibility earlier on in their careers, and therefore eliminate career development discrepancies that occur in the absence of proactive measures in this area.\n\nLastly, by promoting an inclusive culture, the diversity of talent can be leveraged. Awareness and discussion programs are organized by the Group's entities, including dedicated events for raising manager awareness and involvement, 'champions' networks, sharing best practices and creating networks to promote diversity. A number of such events were held by the Group from March 10 to 12, 2020, following International Women's Day, to promote diversity and inclusion.\n\n|     | 2025 Objectives                                                     | 2020 Results                                                        |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 35% | women among Group managers and professionals.                       | women among Group managers and professionals.                       |\n| 25% | women at the highest level of responsibility   (senior executives). | women at the highest level of responsibility   (senior executives). |\n\n## Gender and equal pay\n\nIn France, the law of September 5, 2018, known as the 'Loi avenir professionnel', requires companies with over 50 employees to implement an annual mechanism for assessing gender pay gaps, the result of which is a public social score for the company (out of 100 points).\n\nThe discrepancy is measured using an index made of five indicators:\n\n- \u25a0 gap in average pay;\n- \u25a0 gap in pay rises;\n- \u25a0 gap in promotions;\n- \u25a0 pay rises for female employees after returning from maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 breakdown of top 10 salaries by employee gender.\n\nThe index and the five associated indicators must also be provided to the Economic and Social Committee (ESC) and sent to the Directors.\n\nIn 2020, the Group's 30 largest companies in France with over 50 employees were assessed, as in 2019. Their average Gender Equality Index is 88.4/100, an increase of 3.4 points compared to 2019. The Air Liquide S.A. company published its third annual equality index, scoring 99/100 (versus 98/100 in 2019 and 82/100 in 2018).\n\nOutside of France, the Group initiated a process in 2019 to assess the gender pay gap in entities with over 400 employees. A global process is currently being implemented based on these initial results.",

In France, 533 young people have benefited from work-study contracts and 345 from an internship, combining theoretical learning at their university or school and a practical internship at Air Liquide.\n\nSeniors will represent an increasing share of Air Liquide employees in the coming years. Their contribution to mentoring programs (notably the Technical Community Leaders program), and training programs aimed at younger generations will be further promoted.\n\nVarious initiatives have been introduced within the Group to ensure the support and engagement of employees nearing retirement age. For example, in France:\n\n- \u25a0 16 people became skills sponsors following the pilot launched in France in 2018;\n- \u25a0 'Youth-employment contracts' were continued. They include initiatives promoting the hiring and retention of older employees.\n\nThe Group has international exchange programs to attract and develop young talents: the ALLEX program for engineers and managers and the EVE program for vocational employees (those programs involve more than 500 people since they were set up). These programs were all continued in 2020 despite a decrease in new hires this year.\n\n| 2025 Objectives                                                 | 2020 Results                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| young graduates among managers   and professional recruitments. | (a) young graduates among managers   and professional recruitments. |\n\n- (a)  Indicator calculated annually.\n\n## Disability\n\nLaunched Europe-wide in 2017, the HandivAirsity initiative aims to promote diversity by integrating employees with disabilities into teams and involving the entire ecosystem: employees, suppliers, customers and stakeholders.\n\nThe HandivAirsity Challenge took place once again in 2020 despite the covid crisis. Its aim is to develop and reward projects that support disability within Group entities. 36 European projects were launched as part of this challenge in 16 countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNow more than ever, giving employees with disabilities the best chances of success, creating value, increasing the employability of employees with disabilities and thereby contributing to sustainable development and to social and collective responsibility is a priority.\n\nEvery effort is made to support employees with disabilities at Air Liquide: job adaptations, ergonomic studies, training and active staff awareness campaigns, through initiatives such as DuoDay, the disability European Week, disability integration training, the provision of a hotline and newsletters publicizing our work.\n\nInitiatives are also in progress to contribute to 'indirect' employment the purchase of goods and services from sheltered employment sectors and from independent disabled workers.\n\nWithin the scope of around 5,500 employees in France, a fifth Disability agreement covering the 2020-2022 period is currently being introduced; its aim is to continue initiatives to support employees with disabilities and increase the direct employment rate to 4.2% in 2022 from 3.4% at the end of 2019. By the end of 2020, 37% of this agreement's recruitment goals had been achieved, i.e. 26 recruitments out of the 70 planned.\n\n## Nationality\n\nThere are 34 different nationalities among Air Liquide's senior managers.

Climate risk (greenhouse gas emissions)\n\nClimate risk (greenhouse gas emissions) is part of the Environment and Society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 87).\n\nAlmost 85% of Air Liquide's large production units are Air Separation Units, which do not use any combustion processes and consume almost exclusively electrical energy. Electricity used by the Group to power these units generates CO2 emissions at energy suppliers, which are known as indirect emissions.\n\nThe Group's two other main energy consuming activities are hydrogen production and cogeneration. These account for nearly 15% of large production units and use combustion processes emitting CO2 (direct emissions).\n\nThe Group's production operations consume large quantities of energy, and as a result generate CO2. Air Liquide's business model is based on the outsourcing of its customers' industrial gases needs; many of these customers are themselves major producers of greenhouse gases, particularly in heavy industry. This outsourcing is justified by Air Liquide's expertise, allowing optimization of the energy consumption of production tools and increased purchases of low-carbon energy. However, it causes greenhouse gas emissions to be transferred from the customer to the Air Liquide Group.\n\nIn the interests of defining and developing mitigation measures for this risk, Air Liquide has worked upstream to define scenarios to assess the impact of this risk on its activities.\n\n## SCENARIOS FOR AIR LIQUIDE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY\n\nSince the implementation of its Climate Objectives, the Group has developed a system for visualizing CO2 emissions. This configurable tool takes into account Air Liquide's positioning within value chains, growth prospects for the markets in which the Group operates and the decarbonization potential of its business.\n\nGreenhouse gas emission trajectories (Scope 1 and 2) are calculated based on:\n\n- \u25a0 its choices for decarbonizing existing assets;\n- \u25a0 its choices for investing in more or less carbon-intensive technologies;\n- \u25a0 its low-carbon energy supply strategy;\n- \u25a0 its efficiency gains enabled by optimizing its operations.\n\nThe tool analyzes the variation in greenhouse gas emissions according to:\n\n- \u25a0 production volumes and investments;\n- \u25a0 its energy consumption and selection of energy suppliers.\n\nBased on these results, Air Liquide has produced different scenarios for developing its activities, assessing and quantifying the associated carbon impact for each of them. These data are integrated into the Group's strategy for reconciling its economic development with its contribution to a low-carbon world.\n\nBy defining these scenarios, Air Liquide is also able to identify market opportunities in environment-related areas.\n\n## 2.1.3. Policy and procedures\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions procedure is currently being updated.\n\nIt will include:\n\n- \u25a0 the current regulatory obligations to which the Group is subject concerning greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u25a0 the methodology for calculating scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 a review of investment decisions, taking a CO2 price into consideration, along with an analysis of the opportunities and risks associated with climate transition. Air Liquide uses an internal carbon price of 50 euros per ton.\n\nIn late November 2018, Air Liquide published its Climate Objectives for 2025. These detail the Group's actions to support the climate through its activities, with its customers and ecosystems, by offering low-carbon solutions.\n\nWork is currently underway to strengthen the Group's ambition and climate objectives and to define its contribution to world carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Details of all these initiatives will be shared at the Sustainable Development Day on March 23, 2021.\n\n## 2.1.4. Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 'Affordable and clean energy', 9 'Industry, innovation and infrastructure', 11 'Sustainable cities and communities', 13 'Climate action', and 17 'Partnerships for the goals'.",

Air Liquide is continuing its discussions with the SBT initiative to better value its climate protection actions, both in terms of its own emissions and the resulting carbon benefits to its customers.\n\n## Life cycle assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLife cycle assessment (LCA) is a standardized evaluation method (ISO 14040 and 14044) used to assess the environmental impacts of a product's lifespan, i.e. the acquisition of the raw materials for production, use, end-of-life processing, recycling, and final disposal of a product.\n\nThis method does not generally deal with the economic or social aspects of a product, but the approach and methodologies of the life cycle described in the international standard can also be applied to these other aspects.\n\nAir Liquide's direct emissions mainly relate to the production of hydrogen used to desulfurize fossil fuels. A life cycle analysis highlighted the fact that the environmental cost relating to the CO2 emissions associated with this hydrogen production is largely offset by the benefit relating to the elimination of acid rain and the decrease in respiratory diseases. To carry out this study, the Group implemented a holistic approach that\n\ntakes into account its impact on the various stages of the product's life. This assessment made it possible to calculate the impacts of the different desulfurization processes.\n\nThe Group relies on this approach to:\n\n- \u25a0 assess and take account of environmental impacts when designing technologies, products and offers;\n- \u25a0 maintain and enrich its stakeholder interactions by proposing sustainable solutions to customers and suppliers;\n- \u25a0 improve the efficiency of its processes, rethink the production chain and make the best long-term strategic choices for its investments.\n\n## Working together to achieve Climate Objectives\n\nAs part of the introduction of its Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018, Air Liquide set up a dedicated in-house organizational structure. The announcement of these objectives and the associated action plan have proven to be a factor driving engagement among Group employees.\n\n## Climate Champions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresent within each operational entity, Climate Champions are responsible for rolling out the Group's Climate Objectives. The Climate Champions are the Sustainable Development\n\nDepartment's point of contact in the clusters. They develop a roadmap that defines all the operational measures required to achieve the objectives. Their role includes monitoring KPIs, identifying projects and reporting progress.\n\n## Climate Ambassadors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo support climate actions, a specific organizational structure has been introduced to replicate and promote sustainable development best practices within the Group.\n\nActions by Climate Ambassadors (volunteer employees) cover areas such as recycling, zero-waste campaigns and sustainable mobility. They are tasked with sharing their experience and educating employees about sustainable development in the workplace. The Group had 250 Climate Ambassadors at the end of 2020.\n\nThese actions are also publicized on a dedicated intranet site, where general information on the climate and the Group's strategy in this area is also accessible: Climate Objectives, educational videos, articles, current projects, local initiatives, etc.",

Climate (physical impact on operations) and water management risk\n\nThis risk is part of the Environment and Society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 88).\n\nThe Group depends on water for its activities. Its water consumption is related to the loss of water by evaporation in the process of cooling rotating machines, particularly for the production of air gases, or its use as a raw material for products such as hydrogen.\n\nAir Liquide pays particular attention to water management, especially in areas of water stress. Air Liquide defines water management risk as the possible lack of availability of water which could result in a slowdown or shutdown of a production unit.\n\nIn addition, Air Liquide operates in certain regions of the world exposed to exceptional meteorological phenomena and/or climate change, which can slow down, interrupt activities or make them more expensive. The same applies to its suppliers and customers.\n\n## 2.2.2. Policy and procedures\n\nTo ensure better control over water management risk, the Group is currently producing a water policy. This policy will make it possible to introduce best practices, and measure the impact that water use at Air Liquide sites may have on local populations. This policy will be published in the BlueBook in 2021, and will cover the main areas of water use and management within the Group.\n\nA specific working group has been established to refine water use assessment in operations. Solutions to improve the reporting of water consumption will thus be implemented in the Group's new reporting tool; they will make it possible to take into account more specific situations and thus improve the quality of the data provided.\n\nIn addition, operations that could be exposed to acute risks (storms, hurricanes, floods, etc.) have specific risk management systems designed to adopt preventive measures in close coordination with clients. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nAt the same time, Group assets and business interruption are covered by property and casualty insurance policies taken out in each country where Air Liquide operates. The insurers make regular visits to the main industrial sites for risk prevention purposes.\n\n## 2.2.3. Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 'Clean water and sanitation' and 12 'Responsible consumption and production'.\n\nFor several years, Air Liquide has been implementing initiatives to improve data collection and better guide water management on its production sites to reduce water consumption, particularly in water-stressed areas.\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide consumed 90 million m 3 of water, a 4% reduction compared with 2019\n\nAir Liquide withdrew 257 million m 3 of water from various sources. 69% came from customers, 18% came from freshwater sources such as rivers and lakes, 6% from municipal supply and the remaining 7% from various other sources.\n\nWith regard to Air Separation Units, there are several types of cooling systems:\n\n- \u25a0 more than half of these units have semi-open water circuits, where some of the water evaporates during cooling;\n- \u25a0 about one-third of these units have open circuits. The water passes through the plant to cool it, but all the water taken is returned. Consumption is considered to be zero in this case;\n\nBoth types of units require continuous water top-ups. The cooling process has no substantial impact on the quality of the water returned;\n\n- \u25a0 finally, the other units have closed circuits that do not take water from their environment. These have no water consumption in regular operation.",

The methodology used has been in place since 2017 and the annual water withdrawal was first calculated for the 2018 Universal Registration Document.\n- (b)  Net water consumption\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide has been mapping its sites using the 'Aqueduc 3.0 Water Risk Atlas' map produced by the World Resource Institute (WRI) in order to assess the Group's exposure to this risk. According to this study, 1% of the Group's sites are located in areas that will be considered arid zones by 2030. This assessment takes into account the specific data for each site regarding their location in terms of a watershed, groundwater and an administrative boundary.\n\n## Water treatment\n\nAir Liquide has done a benchmark in water treatment for 35 years, providing its customers with efficient and easy-to-implement solutions to face environmental challenges. The Group continues to support its customers to meet more stringent regulations, and to fight water stress and scarcity with cost-effective solutions.\n\nAir Liquide's 'Essential Small Molecules' (mainly O2, O3 and CO2) play a fundamental role in drinking water and wastewater treatment processes. These gases are key to balance mineral levels in desalination water plants, or to eliminate pollutants from surface drinking water. For\n\n## 2.3. BIODIVERSITY\n\nBiodiversity refers to living species of all kinds, including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and also the ecosystems to which they belong. It includes diversity within and between species, the diversity of ecosystems, and the interactions between living organisms.\n\nTo carry out this assessment, the Group used the 'business as usual' scenario (SSP2 RCP8.5 of the IPCC), which corresponds to stable economic development and a constant increase in global carbon emissions.\n\nindustrial players seeking technologies to treat and recycle water, these molecules help boost the removal of organic pollution from wastewater and to avoid corrosion or clogging in cooling systems. In addition, oxygen also avoids nitrous oxide (N20) atmospheric emissions.\n\nThe Group continues to innovate in water treatment to help respond to the world's growing environmental needs. In 2019, for example, Air Liquide has accompanied the region of Flanders, Belgium, to maintain the biodiversity of the aquatic fauna and flora, while respecting the minimum O2 levels in the river Escaut.\n\n## 2.3.1. Risk associated with biodiversity\n\nThere are two ways in which companies can interact with biodiversity: in terms of impacts or dependency. The biodiversity approach must therefore cover the company's entire value chain, from resource management through to product life cycle analysis.",

        "page_content": "## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\nAir Liquide is mindful of its impact on biodiversity, which encompasses both the diversity of living things and the links between species themselves. At a time when the balance of natural environments is threatened, it is important to preserve biodiversity - not only because of the many services it provides to humanity, but also for its own intrinsic value.\n\nThe Group's production units are generally found on sites located in industrial areas, which limits their impact on biodiversity. Nonetheless, in order to explore this subject in greater depth, Air Liquide is undertaking a more general examination of its product supply chain's impact on biodiversity.\n\nAir, water and soil pollution and global warming also pose a threat to biodiversity, and are addressed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this chapter.\n\n## 2.3.2. Policy and procedures\n\nWaste treatment is an essential factor in terms of biodiversity in many sectors of economic activity. Through its biomethane activities, Air Liquide facilitates the creation of organic waste recovery and transformation channels. There was an acceleration in these activities in 2020.\n\nAir Liquide's anaerobic digestion units enable it to transform the organic fraction of household, agricultural and agro-industrial waste into biogas, thus playing a part in avoiding its decomposition in the open air and protecting biodiversity, according to circular economy principles.\n\nIn addition, in 2020, special attention was paid to the value chain of Seppic, an Air Liquide subsidiary which has been manufacturing and marketing specialty ingredients for more than 75 years. It makes partial use of palm oil for this purpose. It has an RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil) coordinator who manages the action plan to achieve sustainable palm oil goals.\n\nSeppic adheres to biodiversity regulations for the countries in which it accesses genetic resources and their derivatives, and also to the principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol for access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization. The subsidiary constantly monitors developments in associated regulatory tools and the status of the plant and marine species it uses with regard to CITES and UICN lists of threatened and endangered species. An internal validation process is established with a steering committee to ensure that the use of raw materials complies with the Nagoya Protocol and applicable national laws.\n\n## 2.3.3. Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 14 'Life below water' and 15 'Life on land'.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Group\n\nIn 2020, the Group's investment decisions relating to its Biomethane business amounted to over \u20ac100 million for around fifteen projects.\n\nFor example, Air Liquide decided in 2020 to continue growing its Biomethane business in Italy with three additional production units (two in Lombardy and one in Sardinia), which will enable the recycling of organic matter from agricultural and livestock activities, transforming it into biomethane, a source of renewable energy. Investments in support of the circular economy in these three projects will enable the transformation of nearly 250,000 tons per year of agricultural and animal waste from local farms for the production of biomethane.\n\n## Actions undertaken by Group employees\n\nClimate Ambassadors - employees wishing to act to ensure greater sustainability within Air Liquide - have also organized local biodiversity initiatives:\n\n- \u25a0 In 2020, Air Liquide employees in Madagascar participated in a reforestation project.\n- \u25a0 In its efforts to achieve a more sustainable planet, Air Liquide Far Eastern (ALFE) organized a sustainable development month in Taiwan. In October 2020, ALFE offered activities covering topics in line with the Group's Climate Objectives: everyday use of plastic, responsible management of mailboxes and sustainable mobility. Participants were able to spend a month developing their knowledge, proposing solutions and taking practical action for the planet.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Seppic subsidiary\n\nIn 2020, Seppic joined forces with a partner to map all of its dependencies and impacts on biodiversity. The objective is to define priority issues with regard to risks and opportunities, identify strategic solutions for addressing these issues and implementing the appropriate action plan.\n\nPalm oil and its derivatives represent half of Seppic's natural origin inputs by volume. Its fatty chains provide a wide range of properties that are essential to the manufacture of certain ingredients. It is cultivated at higher yields than other oils, but increased world demand for palm oil - particularly from the agrifood and bioenergy sectors - poses a threat to virgin forests. Seppic is committed to transforming the palm oil industry into a sustainable industry. Since 2010, Seppic has been a member of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), whose objective is to transform the palm oil industry into a sustainable industry.\n\nIn 2020, 77% of Seppic's palm oil inputs were Mass Balance certified, and 15% were Book & Claim (B&C) certified. Seppic is continuing its program to ensure that 100% of its palm oil inputs are Mass Balance certified by 2025. In 2020, Seppic specifically targeted the purchase of B&C certificates from small growers to ensure that RSPO supports them in the sustainable transformation of the industry. Since 2019, Seppic has been producing annual traceability reports for its procurement with the help of Transitions, followed by ASD (Action for Sustainable Derivatives).\n\n## NATURAL RESOURCES PROTECTION IN MADAGASCAR\n\nThe Pau site (Serdex) commits harvest workers in Madagascar to the preservation of local natural resources. Serdex has been a member of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) since 2008, and is committed to the continuous improvement of its organizational structure and the management of its supply chains to take account of the impact of the collection of wild plants on biodiversity and social and environmental stakes. At the last membership audit in 2017, 95% of the obligations relating to UEBT membership had been fulfilled. Of the UEBT membership conditions, Serdex has given priority to the Centella asiatica supply chain with a view to improving its ethical practices.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Air Liquide Foundation\n\nIn 2020, the Air Liquide Foundation continued to support biodiversity preservation through scientific research projects on air quality and local development projects in the environmental sector.\n\nIn particular, the Air Liquide Foundation has for a number of years supported the professional integration of people having difficulty finding work via agricultural projects. The Foundation has supported occupational integration projects in urban agriculture, such as the 'Espaces' association project. The association provides training in market gardening on the roof of a shopping center in Aubervilliers.",

In 2020, the Foundation supported the 'Sources d'Envol' association, which\n\ntrains former prisoners in organic farming in the Loire-Atlantique department. This project supports employability in a profession that respects biodiversity.\n\n## 3. Societal stakes\n\n## 3.1. ETHICS AND COMBATTING CORRUPTION\n\n## 3.1.1. Ethical risk and combating corruption\n\nIn all geographical areas in which it operates, the Group faces risks of non-compliance with ethics and anticorruption provisions. These risks are part of the Regulatory and Legal risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page 89).\n\n## 3.1.2. Policy and procedures\n\nIntegrity and transparency are the cornerstones of the Group's ethical approach. They govern the behaviors and actions of all employees. These principles are reflected in a program based on a dedicated structure, codes and procedures, training tools and, finally, whistleblowing and control systems.\n\n## A dedicated structure\n\nA dedicated structure has been set up to support the management of the Ethics program:\n\n- \u25a0 an Ethics and Compliance Committee, comprised of Air Liquide's various global functions (Human Resources, Legal, Group Control and Compliance, Sustainable Development, etc.) and Operation representatives, validates the program's guidelines and priority actions and may, if necessary, recommend penalties in the event of serious deviations;\n- \u25a0 the Group Control and Compliance Department, which is responsible for Ethics, reports directly to one of the Group's Executive Vice Presidents;\n- \u25a0 the Ethics Officer is responsible for providing advice and assistance to entities in the implementation of the Ethics program and in the handling of fraud and deviations. This Officer also suggests improvements to the Ethics program by integrating strategic challenges, best practices, regulatory developments and annual action plans. He/she relies on a network of over 50 ethics correspondents present in each of the Group's geographic regions and business lines.\n\n## Codes and procedures\n\nRules on ethics and conduct, which are shared and actively circulated among all Group employees through the BlueBook in particular, are set out within each subsidiary's Code of Conduct. These rules are implemented as operational procedures or policies at either the Group or local level.\n\n## The key concepts of the Code of Conduct, the employees' Ethics Charter\n\nEach Group subsidiary applies the key concepts of the Code of Conduct. This decentralized approach combines respect for local customs and regulations with Air Liquide's ethical commitment. As such, the subsidiaries embrace the Group's ethical principles by writing their own Code of Conduct themselves in their working language.\n\nThe key concepts of the Code of Conduct (currently being updated) are available on the Group's website at https://www.airliquide.com/ fr/groupe/principes-cles-codes-conduite-salaries. An online training module exists on the employee Code of Conduct which sets out the Group's ethics approach and presents key concepts through\n\ncase scenarios. This module is mandatory and must be taken by all employees each year.\n\n## Compliance with laws and regulations\n\nCodes and procedures have been established to ensure compliance with laws and regulations relating in particular to the fight against corruption, competition law, the duty of vigilance, personal data protection and import and export control obligations.\n\nWith regard to competition law, Behavior Codes have been established, especially in Europe, the United States and Asia. For some of the Group's activities, Healthcare in particular, specific Codes of Conduct on competition law have also been developed.\n\nAudits are jointly conducted on a regular basis by the Group's internal audit departments and an external law firm. They conduct tests and interviews to identify and correct risk practices or any deviations observed. Awareness-raising meetings on compliance with competition law are also held. Finally, an online training program has been launched covering competition law-related practices and international principles.\n\n## Anti-corruption program\n\nAir Liquide's commitment, which is set out in the introduction to the Principles of Action, to prohibit all forms of corruption is supported by a major anti-corruption program. The Group has formalized an AntiCorruption Code of Conduct. This code has been made available to all of its entities and is available on the website at https://www.airliquide. com/fr/groupe/code-conduite-anti-corruption. This Code of Conduct provides a reminder of the anti-corruption laws and covers relations with intermediaries, specific cases such as mergers, acquisitions and partnerships, types of payments requiring particular attention, as well as administrative and accounting traceability requirements and penalties applicable in the event of non-compliance with this Code.\n\nMoreover, the Group has a Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes a chapter on the prevention of corruption.\n\nAn online training module also covers the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct. It is primarily intended for those teams which are most exposed to corruption-related risks (sales, procurement, administrative management, and so on) and managers. These employees must complete this training module every year. It is supplemented by in-person training every three years.\n\nCurrently, these Anti-Corruption Codes of Conduct have been translated into more than 20 languages to ensure their adoption by all employees.\n\nAir Liquide operates a corruption-prevention program in which Executive Management and management are closely involved. This program relies in particular on\n\n- \u25a0 the mapping of corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 the key principles of the Codes of Conduct and an Anti-Corruption Code rolled out within the subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 a complete set of training and awareness-raising actions for those exposed to corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 a third-party assessment mechanism, a whistleblowing system and accounting controls.",

Performance\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee ensures that the ethics program is correctly implemented by monitoring action plans and reviewing indicators such as employee participation rates in classroom training and online training courses. By way of illustration, 97% of Group employees have taken the Code of Conduct online training module.\n\nIt also analyses the corruption and report types received via the whistleblowing system and the results of internal audits or other internal investigations, providing guidelines for changes to the ethics program.\n\n## The whistleblowing system\n\nSince 2015, the Group has operated a whistleblowing system at all its entities (Ethicall for all Group companies excluding Airgas, and EthicsPoint for Airgas and its subsidiaries), whereby employees and external workers can anonymously send an alert to an independent external service provider.\n\nThis alert can relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 conduct or situations that breach the Group's health and safety commitments;\n- \u25a0 serious human rights violations;\n- \u25a0 conduct or situations that breach the Group's environmental commitments;\n- \u25a0 deviations from the Code of Conduct of their entity.\n\nRegular communication (via posters, the intranet, e-learning reminders, management communications) ensures that all employees are familiar with the whistleblowing system and can easily file an alert in their own language by telephone or through the provider's dedicated website. The Group guarantees that any whistleblower who reports something in good faith will not be penalized and no retaliatory measures will be taken, a principle which is reiterated in the Code of Conduct.\n\nAll alerts are handled confidentially and within a reasonable period of time, usually less than two months. Alerts are handled by internal teams in accordance with their nature and geographical origin. Processing managers can utilize external resources if necessary. The most severe cases are reviewed by an Ethics Committee for the relevant hub or general business area, or where necessary by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee. This system complements other means of reporting incidents within the entities (immediate supervisor, Human Resources Department, Legal Department, etc.). It enables alerts to be handled quickly and in a structured way, minimizing their potential impact on individuals and the organization.\n\nThe whistleblowing system is overseen by the Group Ethics Officer, who ensures it is compliant in its implementation, and in particular that it is properly disseminated throughout the Group, alerts are handled appropriately, and whistleblowers are protected. He or she reports the key indicators and lessons learned from this system to the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nIn 2020, 279 reports were produced by the whistleblowing system, including:\n\n- \u25a0 discrimination and bullying: 154 cases;\n- \u25a0 health, safety and environmental infringements: 44 cases;\n- \u25a0 fraud: 60 cases\n- \u25a0 Other: 21 cases\n\n29% of alerts were upheld following investigation, and led to penalties and recovery measures.\n\nAn internal audit of the whistleblowing system was conducted in late 2018, showing strong maturity in the processes. The opportunities for improvement it identified, including the harmonization of processing methods, were implemented.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.2. TAX EVASION\n\n## 3.2.1. Risk of tax evasion\n\nTax risks are part of the financial risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 85).\n\nIn addition to the tax charter and its history of citizenship in fiscal matters, Air Liquide is strongly aware of the consequences of decisions that could lead to accusations of tax evasion.\n\nIt should be noted that Air Liquide's industrial gases businesses are essentially very local in nature. Consequently, Air Liquide generates profit and pays its taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the case of transactions between different countries, the Air Liquide legal entities in question comply fully with the applicable transfer pricing regulations.\n\n## 3.2.2. Policy and procedures: the Tax Charter\n\nAir Liquide has defined the following principles governing its tax policy, in accordance with article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nA large part of the tax charter relates to the fight against tax evasion:\n\n- \u25a0 Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as well as the international standards that affect it such as those of the OECD, in particular on transfer pricing;\n- \u25a0 Group entities ensure that tax returns and payments are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 the Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. It aims to operate in a transparent manner and build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities in the countries in which it operates;\n- \u25a0 the Group handles tax-related matters by banning tax havens, and does not make use of shell corporations without economic or commercial substance;\n- \u25a0 its tax strategy complies with the Code of Conduct.",

Performance\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, Air Liquide focuses on complying with laws and regulations. Changes to laws and regulations are followed and monitored by its Tax Department and its local Finance Departments.\n\nWithin this governance framework, the Group's tax affairs are managed by a team of qualified, dedicated tax experts, who work closely with management and respect the Group's values.\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A., on its own behalf and on behalf of its integrated French subsidiaries, was the first company to sign the 'Fiscal Partnership' with the French tax authorities. By signing this partnership in March 2019, L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries have entered a trust-based, transparent relationship with the French tax authorities. The partnership continued in 2020, and Air Liquide has already received five approvals from the tax authorities providing clarity on a number of topics.\n\n## 4. Respect of Human Rights and commitment to sustainable development\n\nAt Air Liquide, Human Rights management is factored into various different risks which relate in general to human activity within the Group and its ecosystems.\n\nAir Liquide relies upon the various principles of the Global Compact in meeting its commitments in terms of:\n\n- \u25a0 Human Rights;\n- \u25a0 Labor law (see main EFPD risks relating to discrimination and Human Resources management);\n- \u25a0 Environment (see main EFPD risks relating to climate);\n- \u25a0 Anti-corruption (see main EFPD anti-corruption risk).\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE COMPLIES WITH THE PRINCIPLES DEFINED IN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe United Nations Guidelines for Business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization\n\nThe OECD Guidelines for Multinational EnterprisesThe United Nations Global Compact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide subscribes to the highest standards for the conduct of its business and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer signs each year the United Nations Global Compact, the founding principles of which concern human rights, international labor standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. This letter of commitment may be viewed on the Air Liquide and Global Compact websites.\n\nAir Liquide also complies with the international rules of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in terms of labor law and follows guidelines for multinational companies issued by the OECD. These Guidelines encourage the reasonable conduct of companies in terms of professional relationships, Human Rights, the environment, taxation, the publication of information, anti-corruption, the interests of consumers, science and technology, and competition.\n\nMoreover, Air Liquide is a signatory of the Responsible Care Charter\u00ae of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), which aims to improve the chemical industry's overall performance on health, safety and environmental protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder the UN Global Compact, companies are invited to make a voluntary public commitment to ten universal principles related to human rights, international labor standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. Air Liquide undertakes to respect these 10 principles by signing a COP every year on the Global Compact website and by publishing a letter of commitment signed by its Chairman and CEO.",

Sustainable development issues materiality matrix\n\n## APPROACH\n\nCommitment to stakeholders is a priority area in the Air Liquide sustainable development strategy announced in the NEOS company program. In 2020, the Group conducted a consultation of its stakeholders on Sustainable Development issues, as it had previously. The purpose of this matrix is to integrate the main risks and opportunities into the Group's strategy according to the importance attached to them by various stakeholders.\n\n21 issues covering environmental, social, societal, economic, Human Rights and governance aspects were consequently submitted for consideration by the Group's stakeholders. Nearly 1,400 responses were received, compiled and analyzed to produce this materiality matrix of Air Liquide's sustainable development issues.\n\n## METHODOLOGY\n\nAll Group stakeholders were interviewed during this consultation in most of the geographical regions in which the Group operates: customers, patient associations, suppliers, investors, journalists, NGOs, employee representatives, students and future generations, innovation partners, focus groups of employees and individual shareholders.\n\nThese stakeholders represented two categories of profiles:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's internal stakeholders with a strategic insight into topics,\n- \u25a0 internal and external stakeholders with operational knowledge of these topics.\n\nThe project was conducted over four months (from October 2020 to January 2021) by a project team comprising members of the Group's Sustainable Development Department and a Steering Committee formed of representatives from operational and functional departments. A specialized firm was also appointed to support the internal teams for this project and carry out the various consultations.\n\nStakeholders were interviewed using two consultation methods:\n\n- \u25a0 individual qualitative interviews providing a more detailed insight and comments on the various issues and assigned rating,\n- \u25a0 online questionnaires to assess the importance and effectiveness of each issue, sent to a wider audience (e.g. employees).\n\nThese consultations were supplemented by analyses concerning extra-financial rating agencies, press reviews, studies of reporting standards such as TCFD or SASB, and the contribution of a foresight consultant to improve the way in which the Group's various issues and areas of action were presented and defined.\n\nThe results were then consolidated by giving equal weight to each stakeholder's assessments.\n\n## RESULTS\n\nThe matrix shown below highlights the following elements:\n\n- \u25a0 The 21 sustainable development issues are considered to be important by stakeholders. No question received an average score of less than 2 on a scale of 1 to 4.\n- \u25a0 14 issues were assessed as major, with a wide consensus of support. Stakeholders recognize Air Liquide's commitment in these areas and their integration into Group strategy.\n\nIssues such as health and safety at work, ethics, quality of service to customers and climate change action were rated as very important by stakeholders, who also recognize the Group's achievements in these areas.\n\nThe issue relating to protection of the habitats and biodiversity is the only one where the various stakeholders have significantly differing views. The Group has already identified the importance of this issue by addressing the biodiversity risk in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration published in this Chapter (page 314) and by carrying out several actions, also described in the EFPD.\n\nCompared to the analysis carried out previously, the materiality matrix shows the emergence in 2020 of social issues or challenges that are largely taken into account in the Group's strategy:\n\n- \u25a0 adaptation to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (p. 304);\n- \u25a0 diversity and inclusion (p. 325);\n- \u25a0 well-being and quality of life at work (p. 325);\n- \u25a0 remuneration and social protection (p. 324);\n- \u25a0 management of external crises (geopolitical or health crises, etc.) (p. 89);\n- \u25a0 responsible finance and investment (p. 38).",

HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nAir Liquide brings together 64,445 people of more than 150 nationalities, in 78 countries, who form multicultural teams with a host of skills.\n\nThe Group strives to promote diversity, encourage innovation and employee engagement, meet customers' expectations and guarantee Air Liquide's long-term performance.\n\nIn an environment undergoing profound transformation, Air Liquide has developed a Human Resources strategy to identify, attract, maintain and develop competent employees from all walks of life. This strategy is based on the following three priorities:\n\n- \u25a0 encouraging employee engagement;\n- \u25a0 developing an agile and collaborative structure;\n- \u25a0 anticipating the future of work.\n\n## GROUP HEADCOUNT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n## 2.2. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1. Employees' voices\n\nThere is a direct link between employee engagement and Group' customers satisfaction, which is at the heart of the NEOS company program. Employee engagement is one of Human Resources' priorities. Air Liquide has launched 'MyVoice', a program similar to the 'Voice of Customer' project introduced as part of the customer-centric NEOS company program. It aims to improve employee experience and well-being. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act. Following the launch of the initiative in Asia Pacific in 2019, feedback is gathered annually from employees across the entire Group to obtain a better understanding of their expectations and to identify and introduce appropriate measures - and, as a result, significantly increase their engagement.\n\nA short questionnaire of around twenty items is sent to all employees, with the option of leaving comments. The questions cover areas such as safety, work-life balance, career development, inclusiveness, independence, career development and trust. Answers are completely anonymous to ensure that employees are free to express their thoughts. Results are collected in real time, aggregated and analyzed by means of a shared system for the entire Group. All managers have access to their team's results, if the thresholds for ensuring respondents' confidentiality are met.\n\nStarting in 2020, the questionnaire is sent out annually to measure the impact of the initiatives implemented, and therefore changes in employee engagement levels over time. Through MyVoice, Air Liquide strives to offer all employees a positive experience that promotes a listening, interactive approach at every stage of their career with the Group. This level of attention to the employee experience is a key factor in attracting, retaining and developing employees.\n\n## 2.2.2. Mobility for skills development\n\nAir Liquide is continuously looking to recruit diverse profiles to build multi-disciplined and complementary teams.\n\nThe Group's diversity is characterized by the fact that there is no 'standard career path'. On the contrary, each employee adapts their career path according to their individual goals and the career opportunities offered by the Group. Internal mobility and technical expertise are two major factors in career development.\n\n## THE TECHNICAL COMMUNITY LEADERS\n\nThe Technical Community Leaders (TCL) program enables talent in their technical domain to access career paths that offer recognition, satisfaction and influence. More than 3,800 experts have been recognized, playing a key role in sharing expertise, knowledge and technical excellence.\n\nThis community of the Group's technology experts contributes to the transfer of the technical know-how that Air Liquide will need in the future.\n\nIn 2020, this program of identification and development of our technical talents (TCL) appointed 97 new international experts. 2020 was marked by an international campaign conducted entirely remotely to ensure that the appointment process could continue within the usual deadlines. The TCL is therefore a key driver of innovation and a major contributor to ensure the Group's long-term reliability and safety.\n\n## 2.2.3. Employee performance and remuneration\n\nThe performance review meeting is a key stage in employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and their manager on performance and development, the assessment and setting objectives for the year ahead. In 2020, 83% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\nThe comprehensive remuneration of Group employees is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the position held;\n- \u25a0 the degree of responsibility;\n- \u25a0 performance.\n\nIn addition, the state of the local market, pay equity and current legislation are taken into account. It is generally made up of a basic salary plus additional compensation and benefits items.\n\nThe variable part of remuneration is devised locally for certain categories of employees to reward performance. In general, it depends on parameters such as the Group's earnings, the entity's earnings and individual performance, which is measured in quantitative and qualitative terms. By rewarding collective and individual performance, Air Liquide encourages everyone to collaborate and contribute to overall earnings.\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nMost of the managers and professionals have variable pay, which includes sustainable development objectives.\n\nRemuneration may also include benefits such as death and disability insurance, health insurance, profit sharing (a) or solutions to help balance work and family life, which vary by country.\n\nIn 2020, 59% of the Group's employees received an individual variable portion as part of their remuneration.\n\n15% of managers' variable remuneration is linked to sustainable development criteria, such as safety, customer satisfaction, energy efficiency and equality.\n\nFinally, the top 370 Group executives have a significant portion of their variable remuneration mandatorily linked to these criteria, for example safety and Corporate Sustainability Program targets for their entity.\n\nDespite the covid-19 crisis, the Group has maintained its remuneration policy commitments.\n\n## 2.2.4. Well-being at work\n\nThe official definition of well-being in the workplace provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) considers this to be 'a dynamic state of mind characterized by reasonable harmony between a person's abilities, needs and expectations, and environmental demands and opportunities'. Moreover, one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the UN is specifically focused on health and well-being.\n\nThe Group ensures that it builds a performance-focused, attractive and collaborative work environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of Group employees in their workplace.\n\nTo promote well-being in the workplace, focus groups have been created with the aim of improving employees' work-life balance. This approach satisfies employees' expectations in this area. These practices are founded on principles co-created with European social partners. In 2019, the Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose is to prevent psychosocial risks. This has led to the creation of a charter based on action principles linked to improvements in work scheduling, workloads and work-life balance.\n\nIn a broader sense, during this time of change to organizational structures accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, the Group launched the 'Next Normal' worldwide project in 2020 to capitalize on changes to working practices. This will enable entities to provide their employees with a new framework including team management, a supervised remote work policy, redesigned work spaces, and an in-depth review of our interactions with our customers and patients.\n\n## 2.2.5. Legal working hours\n\nEach Group entity defines, in agreement with representative bodies and in line with local regulations, legal working hours which encourage engagement and performance.\n\nIn addition to the regulations, the European 'Care & Perform' principles and rules are also designed to organize work in a way that respects the autonomy, flexibility and private life of each employee.\n\nIn France, the general framework of legal working hours is defined in agreements with the labor unions.\n\nMeanwhile, the industrial businesses, as well as those in Healthcare, include on-call systems that are regularly discussed and are subject to agreements with the labor unions.\n\n## 2.2.6. Renewing social dialog\n\nAir Liquide is committed to meaningful social dialog in all of its subsidiaries. This may take different forms according to local regulations. In 2020, 81% of Group employees had access to a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nIn Europe, the European Works Council has 29 employee representatives from 13 countries. It was renewed in 2017 for a term of four years. In 2020, seven plenary meetings chaired by a member of the Executive Committee were held, as well as five other meetings of the Council's board members. The main themes addressed during information and consultation meetings are: safety, news on the Group's activities, especially in Europe, the annual financial statements, the well-being and psychological health of employees, industrial strategy and its implementation in the different countries where Air Liquide operates.\n\nIn France, the Group sought to improve social dialog, using a debate and project development approach. Two social seminars were held to promote working together (employee representatives, trade unions and management/Human Resources) toward a new aim. This exercise helped to define a roadmap and transformation projects:\n\n- \u25a0 anticipate the management of employability of Group employees in addition to the agreements for forward planning of employment and skills ('Gestion Pr\u00e9visionnelle des Emplois et des Comp\u00e9tences, GPEC');\n- \u25a0 improve the employee representatives' pathway within Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 initiate discussions on the prevention of psychosocial risks.\n\nThis work continued in 2020 despite the pandemic crisis. Regarding employability, negotiations with social partners will begin in 2021 with the aim of reaching a company agreement.\n\nIn addition, 2020 was largely devoted to managing the pandemic crisis together with employee representatives. This took the form of continuous and strengthened social dialog with bodies such as the Social and Economic Council (CSE), the Group committee, the European committee and the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Commission (CSSCT).\n\n## 2.3. AN AGILE AND COLLABORATIVE STRUCTURE\n\nThe second focus of the Human Resources strategy consists of building an agile and collaborative structure capable of addressing the challenges of a continuously changing world. This requires facilitating cross-divisional exchanges within our teams to ensure sustainable performance.\n\n## 2.3.1. Inclusion and diversity\n\nDiversity is a priority of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy and policy and the Group considers it a source of strength, creativity and performance. It is a fundamental element of the organization, in terms of both businesses and employees, and drives the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThe objectives at Group level include enhancing diversity among managerial staff to better recognize the various cultures that make up Air Liquide and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified targets have been set for the Group and its entities regarding gender and nationalities.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nA team within the Human Resources structure is responsible for managing diversity projects. The roadmap is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 deploy diversity objectives at in all entities and implement corresponding action plans;\n- \u25a0 improve all of the Group's Human Resources processes to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promote an inclusive culture to leverage teams diversity.\n\nInternal audits have been carried out to ensure that entities comply with Human Resources objectives, and to verify the monitoring of indicators and the implementation of action plans.\n\nA team within the Human Resources structure is responsible for managing diversity projects at a Group level. Each hub/business then implements its own roadmap and diversity actions with consideration to its own situation. A number of initiatives are conducted locally every year, such as the introduction of a recruitment process that strengthens the role of women, the creation of networks to promote gender equality, and specific career review meetings for women. A new tool called 'Nudge Lab' was recently launched, based on a behavioral approach, to increase diversity, particularly in senior positions.\n\nAt an entity level, the Group's objective is to have teams comprising employees who represent the environment in which they operate. Each entity is therefore responsible for implementing action plans specific to its own environment and legal framework, which may include many forms of diversity (skin color, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, etc.). Through its diversity policy, Air Liquide is strongly committed to fighting any form of discrimination.\n\n## 2.3.2. Gender\n\nThe Group has set a number of ambitious gender equality objectives, aimed at reaching a rate of:\n\n- \u25a0 35% women at the 'Managers and Professionals' level, by 2025. These objectives are in line with the results obtained over the past ten years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 26% to 30%;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\n## PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AMONG MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Including Airgas since 2017.\n- (b) Including Airgas since 2016.\n\nThe ambitious gender diversity objectives set for the 'Managers and Professionals' and 'senior executives' population, and for maintaining the gender diversity goal among 'high potentials', are also intended\n\nto form a talent pool to ensure balanced gender representation on the Executive Committee by promoting female talents to higher levels of management.\n\nIn 2020, women represented 43% of employees considered as high flyers, this level has been increasing regularly for a number of years and must be maintained. The Executive Committee includes five women among its fourteen members. Three of these were appointed in 2019, having previously held executive positions within the Group. Six women are currently members of the Board of Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A., out of a total of eleven members appointed by the General Meeting.\n\nMore generally, and taking the highest level of responsibilities across the Group into account, women hold 20% of the 'Top 100' positions, and 21% of all positions defined as Executive, over and above the goals set by the Board of Directors for 2020. This latter percentage has increased from 19% to 21% over the last three years.\n\nAmong the 10% of positions with the greatest level of responsibility within the Company (a) , 27% of them are held by women; these women have an average age of 51.8 years and a median age of 52.4 years, i.e. 2.4 years and 2.8 years less respectively than the average age (54.2 years) and median age (55.2 years) for men. This difference is due to the policy to promote women to the highest levels of responsibility earlier on in their careers, and therefore eliminate career development discrepancies that occur in the absence of proactive measures in this area.\n\nLastly, by promoting an inclusive culture, the diversity of talent can be leveraged. Awareness and discussion programs are organized by the Group's entities, including dedicated events for raising manager awareness and involvement, 'champions' networks, sharing best practices and creating networks to promote diversity. A number of such events were held by the Group from March 10 to 12, 2020, following International Women's Day, to promote diversity and inclusion\n\n## Gender and equal pay\n\nIn France, the law of September 5, 2018, known as the 'Loi avenir professionnel', requires companies with more than 50 employees to implement an annual mechanism for assessing gender pay gaps, the result of which is a public social score for the company (out of 100 points).\n\nThe discrepancy is measured using an index which tracks five indicators:\n\n- \u25a0 gap in average pay;\n- \u25a0 gap in pay rises;\n- \u25a0 gap in promotions;\n- \u25a0 pay rises for female employees after returning from maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 breakdown of top 10 salaries by employee gender.\n\nThe index and the five associated indicators must also be provided to the Economic and Social Committee (ESC) and sent to the Directors.\n\nIn 2020, the Group's 30 largest companies in France with over 50 employees were assessed, as in 2019. Their average Gender Equality Index is 88.4/100, an increase of 3.4 points compared to 2019. The Air Liquide S.A. company published its third annual equality index, scoring 99/100 (versus 98/100 in 2019 and 82/100 in 2018).\n\nOutside of France, the Group initiated a process in 2019 to assess the gender pay gap in entities with more than 400 employees. A global process is currently being implemented based on these initial results.\n\n(a)  i.e. 109 positions, including all members of the Executive Committee (excluding Executive Officers), as well as expatriate employees whose work contracts are suspended but whose career and remuneration continue to be managed by the Company during the suspension of their French contract.",

Age\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEES BY AGE BRACKET IN 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is committed to fostering better qualifications and training programs for young people to facilitate their integration into the workplace.\n\nInternship and apprenticeship contracts are encouraged. In France, 533 young people have benefited from work-study contracts and 345 from an internship, combining theoretical learning at their university or school and a practical internship at Air Liquide.\n\nSeniors will represent an increasing share of Air Liquide employees in the coming years. Their contribution to mentoring programs (notably the Technical Community Leaders program), and training programs aimed at younger generations will be further promoted.\n\nVarious initiatives have been introduced within the Group to ensure the support and engagement of employees nearing retirement age. For example, in France:\n\n- \u25a0 16 people became skills sponsors following the pilot launched in France in 2018;\n- \u25a0 'Youth-employment contracts' were continued. They include initiatives promoting the hiring and retention of older employees.\n\nThe Group has international exchange programs to attract and develop young talents: the ALLEX program for engineers and managers and the EVE program for vocational employees (more than 550 people since they were set up). These programs were all continued in 2020, despite a decrease in new hires this year.\n\n## 2.3.4. Nationality\n\nThere are 34 different nationalities among Air Liquide's senior managers. The Group's Board of Directors comprises six nationalities. In terms of total employees, over 150 different nationalities are employed by the Group.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.5. Disability\n\nLaunched Europe-wide in 2017, the HandivAirsity initiative aims to promote diversity by integrating employees with disabilities into teams and involving the entire ecosystem: employees, suppliers, customers and stakeholders.\n\nThe HandivAirsity Challenge took place once again in 2020 despite the Covid crisis. Its aim is to develop and reward projects that support disability within Group entities. 36 European projects were launched as part of this challenge in 16 countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNow more than ever, giving employees with disabilities the best chances of success, creating value, increasing the employability of employees with disabilities and thereby contributing to sustainable development and to social and collective responsibility is a priority.\n\nEvery effort is made to support employees with disabilities at Air Liquide: job adaptations, ergonomic studies, training and active staff awareness campaigns, through initiatives such as DuoDay, the disability European Week, disability integration training, the provision of a hotline and newsletters publicizing our work in this area.\n\nInitiatives are also in progress to contribute to 'indirect' employment the purchase of goods and services from sheltered employment sectors and from independent disabled workers.\n\nWithin the scope of around 5,500 employees in France, a fifth Disability agreement covering the 2020-2022 period is currently being introduced; its aim is to continue initiatives to support employees with disabilities and in this way increase the direct employment rate to 4.2% in 2022 from 3.4% at the end of 2019. By the end of 2020, 37% of this agreement's recruitment goals had been achieved, i.e. 26 recruitments out of the 70 planned.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\n## 2.3.6. Network organization\n\nAir Liquide has a decentralized organizational structure which relies on its hubs and clusters (groups of countries or entities). This network structure on a global scale is more agile, fosters initiative and strengthens proximity with customers.\n\nA collaborative work platform called 'Kite' has been launched throughout the Group. Kite is changing every year to offer its users new services. The Group therefore provides employees with the opportunity to create and access Google+ communities through the Kite collaborative platform. These communities rally employees on several subjects: expertise, tools, events, procedures, shared interests, etc. They transform working methods by fostering flexibility, efficiency, diversity and collective intelligence.\n\nThis network structure and collaborative platform have made it possible, during this pandemic crisis, to maintain an efficient working structure and connections between employees.\n\n## 2.4. ANTICIPATING THE 'FUTURE OF WORK'\n\nThe 'Future of Work' cornerstone focuses on identifying the business lines and skills of the future. To do so, the Human Resources teams must understand and anticipate trends that are likely to transform our business.\n\n## 2.4.1. Business lines and skills\n\nThe aim is to implement an efficient action plan to help employees evolve at the same pace as their business line. To support each employee in this new technological environment, Air Liquide University has developed:\n\n- \u25a0 a Business Academy, which was set up to strengthen key skills in the Group's business lines. Over 1,500 employees have had the opportunity to develop thanks to the academy. In 2020, for the purpose of continuity of training, most sessions were held virtually and the process of translating the modules into a dozen or so languages began. Other business line academies are under review in order to meet existing needs in terms of technical skills. This was updated in late 2020, and will be rolled out in the Group in 2021;\n- \u25a0 a 'digital passport', which consists of several self-assessment questionnaires on digital culture in general, but also on knowledge of Kite (the Group's collaborative work platform);\n- \u25a0 Data Summits (Data strategy, Digital Marketing, Cybersecurity, etc.) have been made available to employees in order to move forward with the development of digital skill;\n- \u25a0 data challenges have also been held. These competitions make it possible to share data skills quickly while creating value.\n\n## 2.4.2. Career-long training and development\n\nAir Liquide takes special care to develop its employees' skills and expertise. Several ways of learning are provided. Career development can take place throughout careers and every individual must take a proactive approach.\n\nIn 2020, despite the pandemic crisis, the percentage of Group employees who had at least one training session during the year was 65%.\n\nThe online training offering is upgraded year by year and covers many topics such as safety, ethics, Human Resources processes, management, and, more recently, digital technology.\n\nA new online self-learning package (#ILoveLearning) was deployed in 2019 as part of a pilot by Air Liquide University. Since then, over 10,000 employees have used this self-service training.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF TRAINING TOPICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough its programs and structure, the University, which celebrated its 10 th anniversary in 2019, supports the Group's strategic initiatives and promotes the Air Liquide culture. Today, the University is present at a Group level and globally promotes new ways of learning, in both traditional and non-traditional ways. As such, the Company's various businesses and functions can access tools to design their own programs.\n\nModern teaching methods, for adults, are coupled with formal and informal skills, online training, lessons, support, mentoring, co-development, etc. The programs are as practical and relevant as possible, and use role play, mock exercises, workshops, case studies, guided discussions and various feedback mechanisms.\n\nIn 2020, amidst the pandemic crisis, the digital transformation of many business lines and increased training for employees, the University also launched two virtual campuses open to the entire Group, which revolve around four themes: Management & Leadership, Sales & Marketing, Operational Excellence and Innovation. This has resulted in more than 5,900 employees logged in to over 300 online sessions: webinars, virtual classes, online lessons and learning paths. These events have, firstly, promoted interactions within the Group thanks to participants from 74 countries and, secondly, revealed employees' creative and teaching abilities: most sessions were led by company executives and a contest for creating tutorials was held.\n\nAmong the University's programs, those on management and leadership cover all modern management situations, thereby promoting the use of a shared language at a Group level. These programs help managers understand the increasingly volatile and complex world around them and provide the Group with the relevant expertise to maintain its leadership position over the long term.",

Shareholders: a long-term relationship\n\nMore than 64% of shareholders own their shares for more than 10 years\n\nShareholders have been contributing to and supporting the Group's growth since its creation. During the 2016 acquisition of Airgas, they once again confirmed their commitment to the Group's growth through large-scale involvement in the capital increase in cash with preferential subscription rights. Today, it is thanks to their loyal support that Air Liquide can continue to change and grow. Air Liquide's long-term profitable growth strategy and its commitment to its shareholders are\n\ntherefore closely linked. By promoting individual share ownership, through various measures in place and by offering shareholders the expertise of its dedicated department, Air Liquide fosters a close relationship based on dialog with its shareholders on a daily basis which focuses on the following key principles:\n\n- \u25a0 promoting long-term share investment;\n- \u25a0 encouraging shareholder loyalty through registered shares and the establishment of loyalty bonuses;\n- \u25a0 promoting dialog and meetings, whether in-person or virtual;\n- \u25a0 recognizing and promoting the shareholder's key role.\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL (AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020)\n\n|                                        | 2011   | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016     | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Individual shareholders                | 37%    | 37%    | 36%    | 37%    | 36%    | 33%      | 32%    | 32%    | 32%    | 33%    |\n| French institutional investors         | 21%    | 19%    | 19%    | 17%    | 18%    | 20%  (a) | 19%    | 18%    | 17%    | 16%    |\n| Non-French institutional investors     | 42%    | 45%    | 45%    | 46%    | 46%    | 47%  (a) | 49%    | 50%    | 51%    | 51%    |\n| Treasury shares                        | >0%    | >0%    | >0%    | >0%    | >0%    | >0%      | >0%    | >0%    | >0%    | >0%    |\n| Registered capital                     | 35%    | 36%    | 36%    | 35%    | 36%    | 33%      | 34%    | 35%    | 34%    | 34%    |\n| Capital eligible for the loyalty bonus | 28%    | 29%    | 30%    | 30%    | 30%    | 26%      | 25%    | 26%    | 28%    | 28%    |\n\n(a) In 2016, the proportion of institutional investors in the Group's capital increased due to their over-subscription to the capital increase.\n\nAir Liquide is regularly rewarded for the quality of its financial communication and its transparency, particularly for subjects related to corporate social responsibility (CSR). In 2020, for the third time, the Group won the prestigious Grand Prix de la Gouvernance d'Entreprise awarded by the AGEFI: this prize rewards the attention the Group pays to the quality of its governance, whether it be through the respect of high standards, the diversity and complementarity of the members of its management bodies or the quality and transparency of its communication. The Group also received three awards from TopCom: the Grand Prix d'Or for the 2019 Shareholder's Guide, the Silver Award for the film 'Inventors of the Future' produced for the 2019 Annual General Meeting and the Bronze Award for the 2018 Annual Report.\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is directly involved in General Meetings, digital events with shareholders and Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC).\n\n## 3.1. A STEADY LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE AND AN ATTRACTIVE REMUNERATION POLICY\n\nSince its flotation in 1913, Air Liquide has always shown a profit and shared the fruits of its growth by rewarding its shareholders' trust through a remuneration and loyalty policy based on regular dividend distribution, allocation of free shares, and a loyalty bonus. As a result, more than 50% of earnings over the last 10 years have been distributed to shareholders.\n\n## 3.2. CUSTOMIZED SERVICES\n\nThe Shareholder Services, with more than thirty employees and experts, is dedicated to Air Liquide's shareholders.\n\nAir Liquide provides its institutional and individual shareholders, who are bearer or registered shareholders, with information and support.\n\nIn addition to its steady performance and remuneration policy, and to increase the investment value of shares and reward long-term shareholders, Air Liquide showcases registered shares.\n\nIn 2017, as part of the NEOS company program, the Shareholder Department launched its 'Shareholder experience' approach to continue improving the quality of its services for shareholders. Similar to initiatives launched as part of the NEOS company program on the customer-centric strategy, the aim of this comprehensive approach of active listening and response to its shareholders and their expectations is to streamline administrative procedures by offering made-to-measure services, ensuring improved and wider circulation of strategy and financial information, for example with the live broadcasting of Group shareholder events. The latest digital tools are also at the heart of this initiative, as they are an excellence source of leverage and customization.\n\n## 3.2.1. Registered shareholder services\n\nThis form of shareholding provides access to a loyalty bonus for registered shares held for more than two full calendar years: +10% on the amount of dividends received and on the number of free shares granted during allocation transactions. To receive the loyalty bonus, shareholders must continue to hold their shares in registered form on the date of the dividend payment or of the free share allocation.\n\nAir Liquide is the only CAC 40 non-banking company which manages internally all aspects of its shares on behalf of its 105,000 direct registered shareholders: account administration-holding, record keeping and centralization of the General Meeting. Shareholders pay no handling or management fees, and the broker fees of 0.18% (excluding tax) of the gross amount of the transaction are reduced to 0.10% (excluding tax) for stock market orders placed online and paid for by account debit or bank card: these fees are among the lowest on the market.",

Direct registered shares are registered in the Air Liquide account. Air Liquide's Shareholder Services is the point of contact for the shareholder.\n\n## Intermediary registered shares\n\nThe shareholder asks their financial institution to convert their 'bearer' shares into 'intermediary registered' shares. These shares are then registered in the Air Liquide account and held in a securities account or a share savings plan at the shareholder's financial institution, which remains its point of contact.\n\n## Bearer shares\n\nThe shareholder opens a securities account or a share savings plan with their financial institution. The shares are deemed to be 'bearer' shares. The financial institution is the point of contact for the shareholder.\n\n## 3.2.2. Innovation for the benefit of shareholders\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide opened a 100% digital share account: from the airliquide.com website, in less than 10 minutes, an individual can directly open a direct registered share account by supplying digital supporting documentation. Several thousand people have used this new digital functionality to become Group shareholders.\n\nInformation documents and media for shareholders such as the Annual Report, the Shareholders' Guide, the shareholders' newsletter Interactions , the Webzine Stock & Share and the Invitation to General Meeting are drawn up with a particular focus on educating readers. Comic strips have been produced for young shareholders (under 18 years of age) and their legal representatives; they provide a better understanding of the role of shareholders and an introduction to the Group. Air Liquide also publishes, in the month after the event, a report on its General Meeting available at airliquide.com.\n\nAn FAQ has been added to the airliquide.com website, shareholders section, covering key subjects for shareholders and listing the most frequently asked questions, plus short and practical answers.\n\nDirect registered shareholders have access to a personal online Account on the Internet, so that they can view their share portfolio and useful documents for managing their account, as well as edit their personal information. They can also place buy and sell orders on the stock market online and view, in real time, the transactions conducted on their securities account.\n\n## 3.2.3. The General Meeting, the expression of shareholder democracy\n\nEach year, all Air Liquide shareholders who hold at least one share are invited to the General Meeting. They receive all the documentation relating to their vote more than one month before the General Meeting, either by mail or by email in the case of shareholders who have opted for this means of communication. In accordance with the principle of shareholder equality to which Air Liquide is very committed, each share entitles its owner to one vote. Air Liquide endeavors to make all this material available in English to its non-French shareholders in similar timeframes. Air Liquide centralizes its General Meeting by collecting the votes of its shareholders directly and offers voting by Internet.\n\nIn 2020, as a consequence of the pandemic situation, the Meeting was held behind closed doors. A specific mechanism was therefore implemented in order to maintain the shareholder dialog to which the Group is highly committed, in addition to the usual mechanisms (written questions to the Chairman and live, on-demand broadcast of the Meeting). This mechanism enabled shareholders to ask questions before and during the Meeting, with the Chairman answering the most commonly asked questions during the time usually allocated to the audience debate session (a) .\n\nAir Liquide is already working, and will continue to work, with banks and specialized service providers of all kinds to identify and introduce reliable, secure solutions to enable all shareholders to participate in the General Meeting, both at the physical place of meeting and remotely, before and during the Meeting, in accordance with legal rules.\n\nAir Liquide was the first company to set up a Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC). The SCC is comprised of 12 shareholders and is regularly consulted on subjects relating to shareholder communication, in addition to the three annual plenary meetings with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. A committee member is part of the Air Liquide Foundation's Project Selection Committee.\n\n## THE SHAREHOLDER DEPARTMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn line with the Group's objective to contribute to a more sustainable world, Air Liquide now encourages its shareholders to receive their documents electronically (account documents, General Meeting voting documents, the shareholders' newsletter, etc.). Shareholders who so wish can request for these various documents to be sent by post. In addition, for all its mail shots that require wrapping, the Shareholder Department uses a biosourced film, produced using a raw material that complies with France's NF T51-800 standard.",

RECOGNIZING AND PROMOTING THE SHAREHOLDER'S KEY ROLE\n\nThe continuing decline in the number of individual shareholders in France is a major challenge. Air Liquide is committed to defending individual shareholders' rights and promoting equity investments. The Group has supported initiatives such as those of the ANSA (Association nationale des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions), the Observatoire des Actionnaires d'Avenir and the F2iC (the French Federation of Individual Investors and Investment Clubs), which contributed to the creation of the 'PEA Jeunes', a young person's personal equity plan under the PACTE act.\n\n## 3.4. 2020 STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL SHAREHOLDER RETURN\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide's shares rose +6.38% (vs. a -7.14% decline for the CAC 40).\n\n30 free share awards have been made since 1962.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the overall financial performance of the Air Liquide share, i.e. the rate of return on invested capital, or Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (a) , amounts to:\n\n## END OF 2020 DATA\n\n| TSR                           | 5 years   | 10 years   | 20 years   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| Air Liquide registered shares | +13.06%   | +11.01%    | +10.68%    |\n| Air Liquide bearer shares     | +12.72%   | +10.54%    | +10.12%    |\n| CAC 40 reinvested dividends   | +6.87%    | +7.38%     | +2.81%     |\n\n## 3.5. 2020 INITIATIVES\n\n## 3.5.1.

For more than a century, the Group has been dedicated to involving them in its growth and has fostered a long-term relationship based on transparency, dialog and proximity.\n\nAt the end of 2020, 470,000 individual shareholders held 33% of the Group's capital; this represented the highest percentage among companies on the CAC 40.\n\n## MEETING WITH SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe General Meeting: in voting terms, attendance at the General Meeting was in line with previous years, with nearly 105,000 shareholders casting their votes remotely. Despite being held behind closed doors, the General Meeting was viewed by over 40,000 people either live or in playback mode - an all-time record.\n\nThe dates for the next Air Liquide Combined General Meeting are Tuesday May 4, 2021 and Wednesday May 4, 2022.\n\n'Post-General Meeting' conferences: every year, following the General Meeting, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer visits several towns and cities in France to present the Group's results, strategy and outlook to shareholders. Given the pandemic crisis of 2020, these meetings had to be canceled. Likewise, the regional shareholder meetings attended by the Director of the Shareholder Department and associated teams also had to be canceled. In 2021, Air Liquide will take the pandemic situation into account when organizing such meetings again.\n\nHydrogen Generation: on December 10, 2020, Air Liquide held an extraordinary digital event devoted entirely to hydrogen, attended by Beno\u00eet Potier, Chairman and CEO, with the participation of Bertrand Piccard, Initiator and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, and adventurer, lecturer and author Philippe Croizon. Prior to the event, over 500 written, audio and video questions were submitted by shareholders and the general public. On the day itself, the broadcast attracted an audience of over 10,000 internet users and provided an opportunity to respond to the most frequently asked questions. The event recording and its 'best of' videos have been viewed over 54,000 times.\n\n## 3.5.2.  Institutional investors\n\nThe Investor Relations team met with more than 1,400 investors in 2020 during 11 roadshows, 44 conferences and many individual meetings. Members of the Executive Committee took part in some of these events.\n\nBecause of the health crisis, these roadshows and conferences were held online in 2020, using digital tools set up by the Group to maintain regular exchanges with investors in all geographies.",

Serving customers and patients\n\nIn an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment, Air Liquide focuses its attention on its customers and their satisfaction in order to provide them with long-term growth. To strengthen this priority, the Group Customer Department is supervised by a member of the Executive Committee.\n\n## COVID-19: AIR LIQUIDE'S TEAMS ARE MOBILISED\n\nAir Liquide's committed teams are working on the front line to ensure continuity of service to its customers and patients\n\nThe onset of the pandemic saw Air Liquide teams around the world facing unprecedented constraints in how they operate, as did customers and patients. They demonstrated an exceptional level of commitment commensurate with the challenges they faced. Their motivation and dedication, supported by the collaborative digital tools adopted by the Group, have enabled them to deliver a high level of service, which was confirmed by the above-average satisfaction scores obtained during this difficult period. Customers have sent many praising the responsiveness of Air Liquide' teams, which enabled us to maintain our activity:\n\n- \u25a0 fast installation of equipment;\n- \u25a0 stable level of industrial and medical gas supply, and provision of additional volumes;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of support functions and customer service centers to support remote work.\n\nThe Health teams in particular quickly organized themselves to cope with the increase in requirements for medical oxygen, provide equipment such as respirators for hospitals, ensure stabilized patients can return home and guarantee chronic patients are continually monitored, and more specifically:\n\n- \u25a0 production of 10,000 ventilators in record time, in partnership with several manufacturers (PSA Group, Schneider Electric and Valeo) and around a hundred SMEs;\n- \u25a0 increased medical oxygen capacity worldwide to meet oxygen demand, which has increased five-fold (and sometimes even six-fold) in the most affected areas;\n- \u25a0 custom home monitoring of patients with chronic illnesses during the lockdown, and remote (video) monitoring and visits to high-risk patients with strict application of health instructions;\n- \u25a0 support for the return home of covid-19 patients receiving oxygen therapy or suffering from other conditions, reducing the burden on hospitals.\n\n## 4.1. COMMITMENT TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS\n\nAir Liquide meets the needs of over two million industrial customers worldwide. These customers come from sectors as diverse as steel, agri-food, chemicals, water and waste management, electronics and crafts, etc. The Group's objective is to support its customers by providing them with services and solutions that are both innovative and reliable. This is possible thanks to in-depth knowledge of each of their businesses.\n\nTo assist us in working with and supporting customers and meeting their specific needs, the industrial structure is organized into three different activities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Large Industries\n\nThis business line supplies gas and energy solutions to around 500 customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy industries, which are essential to their own industrial production, to improve process efficiency and make their plants more environmentally friendly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Industrial Merchant\n\nThe Industrial Merchant business line serves over two million customers representing a very diverse range of sectors and requirements:\n\n- \u25a0 Materials and Energy;\n- \u25a0 Automotive & Manufacturing;\n- \u25a0 Food & Pharmaceuticals;\n- \u25a0 Technology & Research;\n- \u25a0 Craftsmen & Retail.\n\nIt offers them comprehensive solutions for implementing and optimizing their industrial processes. Around 95% of the customer base in this\n\nsector is small customers who favor simplicity, flexibility and quality of service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electronics\n\nThis business area supports its customers in the semiconductor, flat panel and photovoltaic markets, drawing on its expertise, worldwide infrastructure and strategic partnerships with manufacturers. The products and services it offers respond to growing consumer demand for improved mobility, connectivity, processing power and energy savings.\n\nThe Group's organization allows each entity and industrial activity to respond to the specific expectations of local customers within its geographical region, thereby building a close relationship with each customer. Customers demand flexibility, responsiveness, service, availability and a genuine long-term partnership.\n\nIn addition, some international customers require fully coordinated global management services. An organization dedicated to strategic key accounts helps support them and meet their specific needs. This program relies on a team of Key Account Managers whose mission is to develop in-depth knowledge of those customers so that they can better respond to their needs and adopt a strategic alignment with their growth priorities.",

Home healthcare\n\nAs a leader in home healthcare in Europe, Air Liquide provides care in the home for people with chronic diseases. The Group provides respiratory, nutritional and perfusion assistance solutions. Thanks to its expert multidisciplined teams, Air Liquide aims to increase patients' autonomy and quality of life, improve their treatment compliance and lower their risk of relapse or rehospitalization.\n\nThe Home Healthcare business is one of the responses to the shift to outpatient care and sits at the heart of the healthcare system between the patient, hospital, doctors, nurses, health insurance organizations, pharmacists and others. Air Liquide supplies the services, products and/or medical equipment necessary to start treatment at the patient's home, following the medical prescription, and trains the patients and their families in the proper use of devices. Air Liquide has three trump cards: its close human proximity to patients at home for over 30 years, its technical knowledge of medical devices (whether connected or not), and its innovative strength, particularly in digital solutions. The Group therefore makes a major contribution to the continuum of care by ensuring follow-up care at home for patients with chronic conditions. This business demands high-quality service on a daily basis and is focused on the long term, with caregivers dedicated to improving the patient's quality of life at home.\n\n## 4.2.2. Hospital businesses\n\nAir Liquide is one of the world leaders in medical gas production and distribution for hospitals and related services.\n\nThe teams work alongside healthcare professionals to develop solutions that allow them to take care of their patients, often at critical moments. Whether in emergency rooms, operating rooms, or intensive care units, Air Liquide's medical gases and associated services make it possible to provide care, alleviate pain, administer anesthetic and improve respiratory functions.\n\nAir Liquide offers services such as 'Total Gas Management' (TGM), which remains permanently at the hospital in order to optimize the supply of medical gases and monitor the different supply parameters so that the hospital can maintain efficiency. Air Liquide supports the transformation of hospital care and the development of outpatient care with a significant presence in the urban medical sector and care centers.\n\n## 4.2.3. Diversification of care settings\n\nAir Liquide's solutions are also dispensed by certain specialists in doctors' practices or at new care settings outside the hospital.\n\nHealthcare professionals such as ambulance attendants, retirement homes, general practitioners, dermatologists and dentists are local practitioners who play an essential role in caring for patients at various stages in their continuum of care. In response to changing care settings and healthcare coordination issues, Air Liquide provides an offering tailored to their specific needs, particularly in terms of mobility and responsiveness.\n\n## 4.3. FROM LISTENING TO ACTION\n\nSince 2017, as part of its NEOS strategic plan, the Group has been directed towards a customer-centric transformation, boosted by a customer experience management tool called 'Voice of Customer' (VoC). This solution provides all entities with the ability to regularly poll (through digital channels) an unlimited number of customers, analyze their comments in real time, identify dissatisfied customers, contact them again and take the necessary steps to address the reasons for their dissatisfaction. Thanks to the broad sharing of customer comments at every level of the Group, appropriate action plans have been identified and put in place to improve the customer experience.\n\nThis VoC platform was launched in March 2017 and has already been deployed in over 60 countries. Feedback from tens of thousands of customers has been collected and analyzed, highlighting each subsidiary's priorities. Furthermore, in 2018 the Group decided to launch transactional surveys to measure satisfaction at key stages of the customer experience (order, delivery, invoicing). This new approach means that customer comments can be collected and analyzed in real time. All this information allows the local teams to identify problems and to fix them quickly by continuously streamlining processes and flows to provide the highest quality of customer experience.\n\nSUCCESSFUL CUSTOMER COMMITMENT\n\n## 150,000\n\ncustomer/patient returns collected since 2017\n\n90% (a)\n\nsatisfied or very satisfied Air Liquide customers\n\nCustomers particularly value the quality of the Group's products and services, safety standards, and the attitude and efficiency of the teams in contact with them.\n\nCustomer satisfaction and loyalty are measured using an international indicator called the NPS (Net Promoter Score \u00ae ). It measures how likely customers are to recommend the Group by asking a simple question:\n\n## 'On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Air Liquide as a supplier?'\n\nThis indicator is tracked in all the business units and in most geographies, giving the Group a common indicator to measure the satisfaction of its customers, better respond to their expectations and improve overall performance.\n\nEach campaign is followed by an in-depth analysis of responses. Following this analysis, action plans are produced to improve the customer experience.\n\nThe scores given by customers are accompanied by comments and improvement suggestions. This valuable information helps the Group to rethink its internal processes and continue innovating so it can continually offer high-quality products and services.\n\nThis approach illustrates the customer-centric transformation strategy that forms part of the NEOS company program.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\n## 5. Suppliers and sustainable procurement\n\nAir Liquide strives to build long-lasting and balanced relationships with its suppliers, in an environment of mutual trust. The Group attaches great importance to its suppliers' ability to offer long-term partnerships and ensure a high level of safety, reliability, competitiveness and innovation, while guaranteeing that ethics and sustainable development are also taken into account. These principles are set out in the following documents:\n\n- \u25a0 the Procurement Code of Conduct, translated into several languages, which applies to all Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n- \u25a0 the Sustainable Procurement policy, updated in 2018, which lays out the guidelines to be applied by the procurement departments to integrate ethical, social and environmental aspects into their procurement processes, and defines the prevention approach for related supplier risks;\n- \u25a0 a CSR commitment clause (covering compliance with the Supplier's Code of Conduct, safety, and the environment) is included in the contract templates used by the Procurement teams and signed by suppliers;\n- \u25a0 the Supplier Code of Conduct is publicly accessible on the Air Liquide website (https://www.airliquide.com/group/sustainableprocurement). It is available in 13 languages and is designed to promote and ensure all our suppliers respect practices relating to Human Rights, ethics, environmental protection and safety.\n\n## SUPPLIER MAPPING\n\nAs part of its monitoring process, the Group produces CSR mapping for its critical suppliers according to four main criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the supplier's activity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of annual expenditure with the supplier;\n- \u25a0 how dependent it is on Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 the location where the supplier conducts its main business.\n\nThe Group has 968 suppliers that are deemed critical from a CSR perspective. At present, 773 (80%) have been assessed on their CSR performance.\n\nIn 2020, 236 suppliers were assessed, i.e. 75% of the suppliers invited to the assessment campaign. In some cases, Air Liquide has asked for corrective action plans to be implemented; the aim is for the plans to be in place within twelve months of their CSR performance being rated.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT TRAINING AND AWARENESS\n\nSeveral measures have been implemented to raise awareness and train buyers in the Group's Sustainable Procurement process, thus strengthening its application within the organization. Sustainable Procurement training modules have been developed. These are for everyone in the Group involved in Procurement and for critical suppliers, and serve to:\n\n- \u25a0 show the consistency between the Sustainable Procurement approach and the Group's strategy;\n- \u25a0 explain the challenges of the Sustainable Procurement approach and position it as a source of value creation;\n- \u25a0 present various tools to facilitate the roll-out of this approach.\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide held training courses in Chinese, English, French and Russian for buyers and suppliers. Training courses are organized by topic and geographical region. Some cover the hiring of new suppliers, the implementation of corrective action plans, the internal assessment questionnaire, and solidarity sourcing. In total, around 170 buyers and some 160 suppliers were trained in 2020.\n\nIn addition, nine internal projects were submitted in 2020 in the 'Sustainable Procurement' category for the 'Air Liquide Procurement Awards' to promote the best initiatives in this field and increase their visibility within the Group.\n\n## A recognized sustainable procurement approach\n\nThis year, Air Liquide was recognized for its Sustainable Procurement measures on several occasions:\n\n- \u25a0 in March, Air Liquide was shortlisted by EcoVadis for its 'Best Internal Stakeholder Engagement' award;\n- \u25a0 in November, Air Liquide was a finalist at the World Procurement Awards in the 'Corporate Social Responsibility' category.\n\n## Sustainable procurement for all\n\nIn October 2020, the Group Procurement Department held its third 'Business Meeting' in France, in virtual format, for the sheltered employment sector in partnership with the HandivAirsity initiative. Among the one hundred or so guests were 10 ESATs (organizations for the social and professional integration of disabled persons) and EAs (Adapted Companies), which presented shared achievements to Group subsidiaries covering a wide range of businesses and services across the whole of France. 80% of ESATs and EAs invited to the 2019 Business Meeting established or renewed a sales relationship with the Group.",

Civil society: actions of the Air/uni00A0Liquide Foundation\n\nThe Air Liquide Foundation, founded in 2008, exists to serve society. Drawing on the strengths of the Air Liquide Group - its expertise and geographical presence - it engages in work to advance science\n\nand thus help everyone to breathe better, and also contributes to regional development through local initiatives and action to promote occupational integration in technical professions.\n\n## COVID-19:  AN EXCEPTIONAL COMMITMENT\n\nThe Foundation takes unprecedented action in response to the pandemic\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the health and social crisis, the Air Liquide Foundation launched its 'covid-19 Initiative', and decided to make an extraordinary additional allocation of more than two million euros available over two years. Its objective is twofold:\n\n- \u25a0 to support scientific research projects on respiratory damage caused by the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus, a health issue close to the heart of the Foundation's longstanding work;\n- \u25a0 to provide greater assistance to partner associations working in the field with groups who are most affected by the disease and the impact of lockdown. Its supported projects supply health kits, foodstuffs and protective equipment, and also play a role in maintaining social connections with the most disadvantaged and combating early school leaving.\n\nThe large number of requests received by the Foundation led it to hold selection committee meetings more often so it could respond to requests as quickly as possible. For example, the Committee and the Board of Directors have approved 33 covid-19 projects worldwide - 10 research projects and 23 social projects.\n\nIn 2020, the Foundation approved 69 projects in 13 countries:\n\n- \u25a0 14 scientific research and education projects on air quality and respiratory diseases;\n- \u25a0 55 'Acting within local communities' projects in fields including occupational integration, education and training, access to care, disability, social welfare, and covid-19 emergency assistance.\n\nSince its creation in 2008, the Air Liquide Foundation has supported over 433 projects in 52 countries.\n\nA dedicated site enables projects to be directly submitted online, in French or English.

Its network of socially engaged employees helps to identify these needs and to monitor  the projects led by local organizations.   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | organizations to give each beneficiary - young adults without qualifications, jobs or training, especially                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Project locations    | Occupational integration: in France and Africa in particular                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                      | Projects recommended by employees: Europe or developing countries in which Air Liquide operates, close                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                      | to one of the Group's subsidiaries,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                      | a key soft skill in employment readiness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                      | n provides mentoring from Air Liquide employees;

THE FOUNDATION AND EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nFrom its inception, the Air Liquide Foundation has always sought to involve the Group's employees in its work. This is still one of its distinctive characteristics today. As such, it gives employees the opportunity to express their social and human commitment and become stakeholders in the Foundation's work.\n\nGroup employees are encouraged to recommend projects for organizations close to their hearts. 52% of projects approved in 2020 were therefore sponsored by employees.\n\nFurthermore, all projects are assessed and monitored by the Foundation with the support of employees.\n\nScientific projects are assessed and monitored by experts from Air Liquide's research centers. Local development projects are supported by employees who work near these projects. The Foundation\n\nthereby provides employees with the opportunity to take part in community work.\n\nThe role of an employee responsible for project monitoring is broken down into three steps:\n\n- \u25a0 making contact and project feasibility study;\n- \u25a0 follow-up and support;\n- \u25a0 final assessment.\n\nThe Foundation wants to further involve employees in implementing local development projects through skills-based sponsorship. Organizations supported by the Foundation will be able to benefit from employees' professional skills. Employees will therefore participate in the development of these organizations.\n\nCurrently, hundreds of employees are involved in the Foundation's actions.\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AIR LIQUIDE FOUNDATION\n\nAir Liquide shareholders also contribute to the Foundation's missions. A shareholder on the Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC) is an automatic member of the Project Selection Committee. The representation of shareholders in this way is a special feature of the Air Liquide Foundation. Their presence is important: the shareholder provides an external perspective, while being familiar with the Group. The other members of the Selection Committee are Group employees, representing the diversity of the Group's business interests.\n\nMindful of shareholders' interest in its work, the Foundation sent them a survey in 2020. Over 6,500 shareholders responded:\n\n- \u25a0 50% of them were familiar with the Air Liquide Foundation;\n- \u25a0 over 90% of respondents believe the Foundation's research work to be important, and 82% believe that occupational integration is another important mission of the Foundation;\n- \u25a0 42% would be prepared to donate to the Foundation; 55% would like to choose the project to donate to.\n\nThese highly encouraging results demonstrate shareholders' strong interest in and support for the Foundation's actions. These responses will be taken into account in future development of the Foundation's work.\n\n## 6.2. LOCAL CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY INITIATIVES\n\nIn addition to the Air Liquide Foundation's initiatives, subsidiaries are also directly involved with communities throughout the world, supporting local corporate philanthropy initiatives. As well as financial support, these actions are successfully conducted with the enthusiastic involvement of employees.\n\n## INITIATIVE #WEREAD\n\nDuring lockdown, Air Liquide employees in the United States partnered with the Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation to support the #WeRead initiative. The aim of this virtual reading-aloud program is to share the 'power of stories'. It is an effective way to help children develop their reading and writing skills and acquire a taste for reading that they will hopefully retain throughout their lives. Employee volunteers then recorded themselves reading stories to enable children to develop their skills - even remotely!\n\n## ENGAGE&VOUS\n\nIn partnership with the Nos quartiers ont du talent employment association, Air Liquide France Industrie's 'Engage&Vous' skills-based sponsorship program allows employees to set aside up to two days a year for work with the association, sponsoring a young person in their search for work. Sponsorship involves employees providing their business skills and experience to support the integration of a young graduate student up to 30 years old into a job, work-study program or entrepreneurship.\n\nIn response to the covid-19 pandemic, employees have also been encouraged to use this system to engage in community initiatives directly linked to the health crisis.\n\n## CRYOLOR ASIA PACIFIC\n\nIn India, Cryolor Asia Pacific employees took action during lockdown to provide support to the poorest groups in the village where the plant is located. Basic products, including food (rice, lentils, oil, wheat flour, soap, etc.) were provided to them. Cryolor also donated masks and disinfectant to the police station in recognition of officers' frontline roles in serving the community during the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\n## 7. Relations with the public sphere\n\nAir Liquide has formalized a Public Affairs policy and roadmap governing the Group's interactions with the national, regional and international public spheres to promote its activities, develop growth opportunities, anticipate risks relating to regulatory changes, and involve Air Liquide in public debate in the sectors in which it operates. This policy specifies that Air Liquide will work with the institutions and public authorities of each country in which it does business in a constructive and transparent manner, following ethical rules and applying political neutrality. All of the Group's actions respect the official lobbying regulations in force in the countries in which it is present.\n\nAir Liquide is therefore listed on the 'Transparency Register' of European institutions and in France in the 'Interest Representatives' register, which was created in 2017 and is managed by the High Authority of Transparency in Public Life (Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique - HATVP).\n\nWorking within the European and International Affairs Department, the team, in conjunction with the Group's Business Lines, covers the following sectors: energy/hydrogen transition, circular economy, innovation, technologies, digital and health.\n\n- \u25a0 energy and environmental transition with the growth of alternative energies (hydrogen, biogas, photovoltaics, wind power, etc.), and their applications, particularly in terms of mobility and energy efficiency;\n- \u25a0 carbon markets with regulatory changes in Europe and the development of regional markets in North America and Asia Pacific; the competitiveness of companies at a worldwide level;\n- \u25a0 public health issues, particularly relating to access to care during a pandemic (supply of medical oxygen, manufacture of respirators, etc. during the covid-19 crisis), care for patients with chronic diseases, air quality;\n- \u25a0 the opportunities and risks relating to the digitalization of the economy;\n- \u25a0 the defense of Air Liquide's shareholding model;\n- \u25a0 space exploration at a European level;\n- \u25a0 the defense of intellectual property and the launch of the European unitary patent and of the Unified Patent Court;\n- \u25a0 environmental and societal reporting challenges. In relation to fiscal matters, Air Liquide is particularly attentive to paying taxes in countries in the Group footprint and to the desire for good relations with local tax authorities.\n\nIn addition, managers specializing in public affairs in the principal countries, comprising a network of around 20 people worldwide, are coordinated by the European and International Affairs Division. These managers' tasks are to monitor public initiatives liable to impact the Group, and to interact with the local and/or regional authorities to defend or promote Air Liquide's interests. This network allows the Group to work on defining joint positions on cross-sectional challenges such as energy transition, the circular economy, health and innovation, and\n\nto share information on changes in societal challenges in different parts of the world.\n\nAir Liquide's Public Affairs policy also aims to establish and develop constructive and sustainable relationships, in Air Liquide's various sectors of operation, with:\n\n- \u25a0 public authorities;\n- \u25a0 professional bodies which represent the sectors in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 other actors such as non-governmental organizations and think tanks.\n\nThese interactions can take place either directly or through national or international associations of professional bodies such as the European Roundtable of Industrialists (ERT).\n\nIn the context of contacts with investment funds, Air Liquide also specified that we are working with public authorities to contribute to the development of a regulatory framework in favor of carbon neutrality for industrial companies and, more broadly, for the related ecosystem.\n\nIt should be noted that 2020 was marked by a number of major Public Affairs events, aimed not only at growing the Group's business but also improving French and European competitiveness. These include:\n\n## Making France a technologically disruptive economy\n\nFebruary 7, 2020 saw the publication of a report produced by a College of Experts for France's Minister of the Economy and Finance and Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation. The report was intended to establish an ambitious, selective strategy to launch a new industrial and entrepreneurial dynamic in emerging industrial markets. Beno\u00eet Potier, Chairman and CEO of Air Liquide, appointed as a member of this team, actively contributed to defining the key markets, emerging markets which presented major challenges in terms of competitiveness. The identification of these emerging markets in which France has the potential to play a leading role on a global scale, focused around four fundamental societal challenges (healthy and sustainable food, the health and well-being of our fellow citizens, the environment and the ecological and energy transition, and digital sovereignty), helped to define the structure of the Productive Pact recovery plan presented by the Government in October 2020.\n\n## Participation in the development of the quantum technologies acceleration strategy in France for 2020-2025\n\nAir Liquide was involved in drafting the parliamentary report produced as part of the quantum technologies mission. This report created strong cohesion between the various stakeholders and initiated partnerships within this French ecosystem. State support, with targeted funding for its enabling technologies, is fundamental in creating the industrial sectors and technological solutions that will make France a key quantum player.",

LIST OF PRODUCTION UNITS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT\n\nThe environmental elements that are most representative of the Group's activities and part of Air Liquide's Sustainable Development reporting are described below. They cover a total of 643 Air Liquide production units worldwide.\n\n| Type of  production unit                             | Number of  production units   | Applications and environmental footprint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Large Air  Separation Units  (ASUs)                  | 394                           | Large Air Separation Units produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon, with some sites also producing rare  gases such as krypton and xenon. These plants 'without chimneys' do not use any combustion processes. They are particularly  environmentally friendly, as they emit no CO 2 , sulfur oxide (SOx), or nitrogen oxide (NOx). They use electricity almost exclusively: worldwide they use around 3,600 MW at any given moment.  The electricity purchased from our energy suppliers and consumed by the Air Separation Units is the  source of indirect emissions. The cooling systems of these units require back-up water.                                    |\n| Hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide units  (HyCO)         | 48                            | Large hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units also produce steam for some customers.  The raw material used is primarily natural gas and a quantity of water required for the reaction that  produces hydrogen. Carbon monoxide is an essential raw material in the chemical industry for  producing plastics. The desulfurization of hydrocarbons to produce fuels with reduced sulfur content  is one o f  the main applications of hydrogen. These units emit CO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx), but  virtually no sulfur oxides (SOx). They also consume electricity and their cooling circuits require  back-up water.                                    |\n| Cogeneration  units                                  | 19                            | Cogeneration units produce steam and electricity simultaneously. They consume natural gas and  water, mostly converted into steam and supplied to customers. The steam can be condensed at these  customers' facilities and then reused in the cogeneration unit. In most cases, the electricity produced  is supplied to the local electricity distribution network, which in some countries can be used to power  the Group's other units. Combustion of natural gas produce s  CO2 and leads to low nitrogen oxide  (NOx) emissions, but virtually no sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions.                                                                           |\n| Acetylene units                                      | 57                            | These units produce acetylene, a gas primarily used in metal welding and cutting. 50 of these units  produce this gas through the decomposition of a solid (calcium carbide) using water. Two units fill  cylinders with this gas, which is supplied by another industrial company. This process produces lime,  at least 90% of which tends to be recycled in industrial and agricultural applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Nitrous oxide  units                                 | 11                            | Nitrous oxide is used primarily as an anesthetic gas in the healthcare sector and as a sweetening  agent in the food industry. It is produced from ammonium nitrate in solid form or as a water-based  solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Carbon dioxide  liquefaction and  purification units | 79                            | These units liquefy and purify carbon dioxide, which has many industrial applications, especially in  the food industry, where it is used to deep-freeze foods or produce carbonated beverages. Carbon dioxide is most often a by-product of chemical units operated by other manufacturers. In  certain cases, it is found naturally in underground deposits. In other cases, it comes from the Group's hydrogen and carbon monoxide units. It is purified and  liquefied in Air Liquide units consuming electricity and cooling water. Carbon dioxide is thus reused  for other industrial applications instead of being emitted directly into the atmosphere. |\n| Units for the  Hygiene and  Specialty  Ingredients   | 9                             | These production units for the Hygiene and Specialty Ingredients business are located in France,  Germany and China and belong to the subsidiaries Sch\u00fclke (Hygiene business) and Seppic (Specialty  Ingredients business). Air Liquide experts work closely with hospitals to help them reduce the risk  of nosocomial infection and contamination, thanks to the products the Group has developed. These  units consume natural gas, electricity and water. Combustion of natural gas produces small amounts                                                                                                                                                   |\n| business Engineering &  Construction  units          | 6                             | of CO 2 .

Scopes 1 and 2\n\n|                                                                                              | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Scope 1: total direct greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)   (in thousands of tons of CO2-eq.) (a) | 14,062 | 14,476 | 15,390 | 15,641 | 14,955* |\n| Scope 2: total indirect GHG emissions  (in thousands of tons of CO 2 ) (b)                   | 11,174 | 11,679 | 12,422 | 12,207 | 12,516* |\n| TOTAL  (in thousands of tons of CO2-eq.)                                                     | 25,236 | 26,155 | 27,812 | 27,848 | 27,471* |\n\n- (b)  Total of indirect GHG emissions generated by the production of electricity and steam purchased outside the Group. The calculation takes into account the various primary energy sources that each country uses to produce electricity (source: International Energy Agency).\n\nThe Group's direct emissions (Scope 1) are slightly decreasing from 15.6 million tons of CO2-equivalent in 2019 to 15.0 million tons in 2020, a reduction of 4%. This reduction is mainly due to the sale of the Fujian gasification plant.\n\nThe Group's indirect emissions (Scope 2) increased very slightly from 12.2 million tons of CO2-equivalent in 2019 to 12.5 million tons in 2020, a slight rise of 2.5%. This change is due to the inclusion of new assets in the scope base, which is part of our continuous improvement approach to reporting, as well as a slight decrease in activity at our air gas production assets.\n\nIn addition, 3.6 Mt of CO2 were purified and supplied to customers by Air Liquide in 2020 for use in various applications such as greenhouses and the food industry.\n\n## 2.3.2.

This reduction is explained by a decrease in the production of our assets, leading to a decrease in their load factors and therefore a loss of efficiency.\n\nEmissions brought to our customers decreased by 1.0 MtCO2. This reduction is explained by a decrease in steel production in Europe and America in 2020, leading to a decrease in the supply of oxygen for oxycombustion processes.",

Scopes calculation methodology\n\n## Scope 1\n\nThe majority of Air Liquide's Scope 1 emissions are from its hydrogen production and cogeneration units. Scope 1 emissions are the difference in carbon content between the natural gas consumed by these units and the carbon content of their products. Air Liquide also records direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in its truck fleet, as well as gas losses from its nitrous oxide production units.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nAir Liquide reports its Scope 2 emissions using a location-based methodology. These emissions are linked to the production of electricity and steam purchased outside the Group in its various countries of operation. This electricity and steam are mainly used to supply the Group's Air Separation Units.\n\n## Scope 3\n\n| Categories                                    | Scope                                                                                  | Methodology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 - Purchased goods  and services             | Products purchased from a third  party corresponding to operating  expenses            | Spend-based methodology Emissions are estimated from the volumes of purchased products  (\u20ac)  multiplied  by emission factors provided by the ADEME and CEDA databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 2 - Capital goods                             | Products purchased from   a third party corresponding to  investment expenses          | Spend-based methodology The volumes of purchased products  (\u20ac)  are multiplied by emission factors  provided by the ADEME and CEDA databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| 3 - Energy (not included  in Scope 1 or 2)    | Purchases of energy, steam   and fuel                                                  | Average-based methodology The volumes purchased (GJ) are multiplied by upstream emission factors  (Well-to-Tank)  supplied  on  a  per-country  and  per-fuel  type  basis  by  UK  Government and World Data Bank databases.                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| 4 - Upstream  transportation                  | Upstream land, air, sea transport  and other miscellaneous costs                       | Spend-based methodology Emissions are estimated on the basis of contracted transport and distribution  services  (\u20ac)  multiplied by emission factors provided by the ADEME and CEDA  databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 5 - Waste                                     | Not reported                                                                           | Emissions in this category have been estimated using an average-based  methodology and account for less than 1% of Scope 3.

WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS\n\nAir Liquide wishes to be part of a process of continuous improvement of its environmental footprint regarding waste. To this end, in 2019, the reporting of waste and by-products changed to provide a more comprehensive view of the types of waste generated and their management.\n\nThis qualitative approach focuses on the three main hazardous waste groups at each site, allowing a better appreciation of the main environmental impacts associated with waste in each location. This new approach is to be refined in the coming years, in order to provide a view that will allow this environmental footprint to be managed more effectively within the Group.\n\n| Main hazardous waste   | % of sites which mentioned it as one of their three main  hazardous waste categories*   | Treatment mode   | Volume  concerned*   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Oils                   | 58.1%                                                                                   | Recycling        | 55.9%                |\n| Paints and solvents    | 18.6%                                                                                   | Incineration     | 48.4%                |\n| Batteries              | 15.4%                                                                                   | Recycling        | 95.9%                |\n\nFor non-hazardous waste, the main waste groups are metal, paper, wood and plastics. More than half of our sites provide a selective collection of this waste. More than 90% of metal is recycled across all of our sites.\n\n|                                                                                                           | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019        | 2020         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------------|\n| Non-hazardous waste and by-products                                                                       |        |        |        |             |              |\n| Annual quantity of lime produced  (extracted dry equivalent) by the acetylene production units  (in tons) | 26,000 | 25,000 | 25,380 | 31,247      | 27,966       |\n| % recycled                                                                                                | >80%   | >90%   | >90%   | >90%        | >90%         |\n| Metal waste  (in tons) (a)                                                                                | 5,700  | 61,513 | 61,680 | 20,632  (b) | 6,861  (c) * |\n| % recycled                                                                                                | >99%   | >99%   | >99%   | >99%        | >99%         |\n| TOTAL NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS (ESTIMATE IN  TONS)                                             | 31,700 | 86,513 | 87,060 | 51,879      | 34,827       |",

Specific indicators for the Home Healthcare business linked to the issue of socially responsible bonds\n\nIn 2012, Air Liquide issued its first SRI** - labeled bond under its Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) program, for a total amount of 500 million euros. This bond was mostly placed with investors having SRI management mandates and permitted the Group to diversify its financing sources. After numerous public authorities and supranational issuers, Air Liquide became the first company in the world to issue bonds meeting the criteria of SRI investors. Obtaining a rating from the extra-financial rating agency Vigeo for the Home Healthcare business led to this issue being given an SRI label. This assessment is based on social, environmental and governance criteria for the Home Healthcare business, which covers over 1.8 million patients worldwide. In the course of this SRI bond issue, Air Liquide made a commitment to publishing indicators specific to the Home Healthcare business relating to the environment, safety and employee diversity throughout the life of these bonds, i.e., nine years.\n\n| Number of patients treated                                                       | 2016      | 2017      | 2018      | 2019      | 2020      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total number of patients treated by the Air Liquide Home Healthcare Division     | 1,400,000 | 1,560,000 | 1,630,000 | 1,700,000 | 1,780,000 |\n| Group employees                                                                  |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Home Healthcare employees  (a)                                                   | 9,492     | 10,015    | 10,143    | 10,425    | 10,919    |\n| Safety                                                                           |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Number of lost-time accidents of at least one day among employees                | 63  (b)   | 66  (b)   | 63  (d)   | 65  (b)   | 32  (b)   |\n| Number of accidents of subcontractors and temporary workers  (c)                 | 21  (d)   | 8  (b)    | 16  (b)   | 20  (b)   | 14  (b)   |\n| Gender mix                                                                       |           |           |           |           |           |\n| % of women among managers and professionals                                      | 57%       | 58%       | 56%       | 55%       | 54%       |\n| % of women among managers and professionals hired during the year                | 62%       | 59%       | 60%       | 58%       | 57%       |\n| Training                                                                         |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Average number of days of training per employee, per year                        | 2.1       | 1.9       | 2.1       | 2.1       | 1.5  (e)  |\n| Kilometers driven and CO2 emissions related to transportation                    |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Kilometers driven per patient monitored per year                                 | 131       | 118       | 111       | 110       | 97        |\n| CO2 emissions related to transportation per patient  (kgCO 2 /patient)  per year | 29        | 23        | 21        | 20        | 17        |\n\n- (a)  Employees under contract, excluding temporary employees.\n- (b)  No fatal work accidents.\n- (c)  Personnel working under an Air Liquide contract at a Group site, at a customer site, or as a delivery vehicle driver.\n- (d)  One fatal accident (road accident).\n- (e)  11.3 hours per year when counted in hours (base: 1 day = 7.5 hrs).\n\n## 4.

GHG EMISSION QUOTA SYSTEMS\n\nAir Liquide is present in a number of regions that have implemented or are in the process of implementing quota systems for greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory developments are being followed by the Air Liquide teams to make sure that the Group's activities comply with the obligations associated with these quota systems.\n\n## 5.1.1. In Europe\n\nIn the European Union, the European ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) directive established a system of greenhouse gas emission quotas in 2005, in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's climate change objectives. After an initial phase from 2005 to 2007 and a second phase from 2008 to 2012, a third phase, covering the period from 2013 to 2020, has made it possible to expand the scope of industrial facilities subject to the ETS.\n\nFor Air Liquide, in 2019, this directive affected all of its cogeneration sites in Germany, France and the Netherlands, as well as all of the Group's large hydrogen production sites in Europe. With regard to hydrogen production units, a portion of the CO2 emission quotas is allocated for free according to a benchmark established for the top-performing European facilities. Air Liquide receives the remaining CO2 quotas for the market or its customers in order to cover the hydrogen production site emissions not covered by the free allocations and for all emissions from cogeneration sites. Apart from the scope of the phase three of ETS, the new installation (SMR-X) will increase the portfolio of Air Liquide for the fourth phase, which started in 2021 and will end in 2030.\n\n## 5.1.2. In China\n\nFrom 2013, the Chinese government had launched pilot ETS programs in seven provinces/cities (Guangdong, Hubei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen). Four Air Liquide entities participated in the program. Moreover, a national carbon market was just in operation in January 2021 after nearly 4-year's preparations since 2017. At the current stage, the national carbon market will cover around 1,100 GW of coal- and gas-fired power plants, including captive power plants, across 30 provinces and municipalities, equivalent to 4 billion metric tons of carbon emissions (source from IHS). In the future, more industries are expected to be included in the national system.\n\n## 5.1.3. In Canada\n\nIn Canada, the federal government announced the provinces and territories that were aligned with the federal carbon tariff benchmarks. Three provinces, which achieved the federal benchmark, will continue implementing their current carbon tariff initiatives: Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec. Four provinces failed to achieve the federal benchmark: Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan. As a result, Air Liquide Canada has chosen to participate voluntarily in the federal compensation system for its Ontario facilities.\n\n## 5.1.4. In Kazakhstan\n\nThe new National Quota Allocation Plan must be approved no earlier than April 1, 2021. Unlike the previous period, it will be valid for 1 year instead of 3 years. According to the government's plans, a new Environmental Code is expected to come into force after 2021, which will entail a change in the national quota system. Applications for the current year's quotas must be submitted no later than the 1 st April.\n\nThe ETS currently only covers the electricity production sector. Other regions, such as South Korea and California have also implemented a national emission quota exchange system. In 2018, a CO2 taxation system was put in place in Singapore.\n\n|                                | 2020                  | 2020                  |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| System  (in thousands of tons) | Allowances  Allocated | Allowances  Purchased |\n| California CaT                 | 1,180                 | 197  (a)              |\n| EU ETS  (b)                    | 2,683                 | 2,699                 |\n| Kazakhstan ETS                 | 166                   | 0  (a)                |\n| Korea ETS                      | 185                   | 0  (a)                |\n| Shanghai Pilot ETS  (c)        | 1,494                 | 63  (a)               |\n| Canada ETS                     | 571                   | 0                     |\n\n- (a)  Estimates to be validated by local regulation.\n- (b) Taking into account Joint Ventures for which the Group's partners are responsible for the purchase of allocations.\n\n## 5.2. MARKET AUTHORIZATION REGULATIONS\n\nThe distribution of substances, products and articles is part of the product stewardship approach developed by the chemical industry.\n\nIn terms of market authorizations, Air Liquide is mainly affected by four regulations: chemical substances (REACH), biocidal products (BPR), plant protection products (PPP) and fluorinated gases (F-gas).\n\n## 5.2.1. European REACH regulation - Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006\n\nREACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals) is a European Union regulation that governs the registration, notification, restriction and authorisation of chemical substances produced in or imported into the European Union. Air Liquide also ensures that the raw materials used and placed on the market comply with the REACH regulation.\n\n## 5.2.2.  REACH registration of chemical substances\n\nAny chemical substance imported into or manufactured in Europe in excess of one ton per year must be registered with the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA. Each manufacturer or importer must have its own registration.\n\nThe European REACH regulation came into effect in 2007, and the registration procedures for existing substances manufactured or imported in excess of one ton per year were scheduled to run until May 31, 2018. After this date, the obligations relating to the maintenance and updating of files continue in the event of production or import in a higher tonnage band, during the review of registration files by the authorities, during administrative updates and when new information on risks to humans or the environment comes to light.\n\nThe same obligations will apply to all new substances from the first ton produced or imported into Europe.\n\nAir Liquide's main products, such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, CO2, helium and rare gases are not subject to registration under REACH.\n\nAir Liquide is lead registrant for several substances, in particular specialty gases for the Electronics business (NF3, CF4, C4F8, SiF4...). Air Liquide is ordinary registrant for several other substances: carbon monoxide, acetylene, methanol, lime, nitrous oxide, ultra-pure fuels have been registered under this regulation by each subsidiary concerned.\n\nIn addition, Seppic, manufacturers of specialty ingredients for health and beauty, is subject to REACH regulations for some of its substances. Seppic has anticipated the implementation of the European REACH",

In parallel with the European dossiers submitted within the framework of the REACH regulation, Seppic also ensures compliance with similar regulations outside Europe.\n\nIn 2020, Group sales subject to registration under REACH represent less than 3% of Group turnaround.\n\n## 5.2.3. Restriction under REACH of the use of chemical substances\n\nAir Liquide is mainly impacted by restrictions relating to the use of solvents used to distribute acetylene. The DMF solvent restriction file was finalized in October 2018. NMP, a potential substitute, is also subject to restricted use since May 2020.\n\n## 5.2.4. Authorization under REACH: transitional authorization of chemical substances\n\nTransitional authorizations before permanent cessation of use in Europe apply to SVHC (Substances of Very High Concern) substances included in the candidate list for authorization.\n\nAir Liquide does not distribute substances subject to authorization. These SVHCs are essentially contained in articles distributed for the commissioning or production of gases.\n\n## 5.2.5. Notification under REACH of articles manufactured, imported or distributed\n\nNotification to the European Chemicals Agency of any SVHCs, listed in the candidate list, is mandatory when the product concentration is greater than 0.1% by weight and if the total imported or produced exceeds one ton per year .\n\nThey must also be communicated during any distribution of these articles to professionals or industry. Communication to individuals is only applicable if a consumer explicitly requests it.\n\nSuch SVHCs are contained in the articles for gas commissioning or gas production.\n\nIn the case of complex items, composed of several elementary items, the 1% threshold applies to the most elementary part and not to the complex whole.\n\n## 5.2.6. Notification in the SCIP database of items placed on the market\n\nThe WFD (Waste Framework Directive) requires distributors of articles containing SVHCs, as defined by REACH, above 0.1% by weight, to fill out a database called SCIP, where the article is described and the location of the SVHC substance is designated. There is no threshold limit as for REACH notifications.\n\nAir Liquide as a supplier of articles and equipment, medical or non-medical (e.g. freezing tunnels) is concerned.\n\nThis SCIP database will be used at the end of the article's life when it is dismantled by waste treatment or recycling centers as part of the circular economy.\n\nAir Liquide now requires its equipment suppliers to inform it of the presence and precise location of all elementary parts containing SVHCs.\n\n## 5.2.7. Biocide Regulation (BPR - 2012) and Plant Protection Products Regulation (PPP - 2009)\n\nThese old regulations (2012 BPR and 2009 PPP), applicable throughout Europe, are often accompanied by national decrees on phytosanitary products. The use of gases such as CO2 is often as insecticides, replacing chemicals that are banned in Europe.\n\nThese 2 regulations require an approval of the substance at the European level, prior to the application for national authorization.\n\nSince 2016, Air Liquide has been involved in the PPP renewal files for the approval of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4), whose renewals are due in 2020 and 2022 respectively.\n\nAfter approval, the internal distribution channels, or supply chain, will have to be reviewed because the sources of these BPR and PPP products require sourcing exclusively from the sources referenced in the approval file.\n\nUnder BPR, the review of the Ozone approval file is still in progress and the appropriate requests for authorization both for the use in our industrial facilities and for the marketing of its precursor, oxygen, will then be submitted. This concerns applications for water purification, container disinfection and industrial water treatment.\n\nThe BPR and PPP regulations also impose additional labeling obligations.\n\n## 5.2.8. Regulation F-GAS (2014) Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014\n\nThis European regulation only applies to fluorinated gases placed on the market within the Union. It imposes marketing quotas on HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) type gases because of their very high global warming potential. The other gases concerned by this regulation are monitored and are therefore subject to a reporting obligation.\n\nAir Liquide mainly markets this type of gas for the electronics sector only. Fluorinated gases used in this sector are destroyed before release and therefore their use is exempted from the regulation.\n\n## 5.2.9. Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals\n\nThe Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, better known as GHS, was created by the United Nations. This system sets out the classification of chemical products according to the types of danger that they represent and provides standardized hazard information, including labeling.\n\nThis labeling must provide key information concerning health, safety and environmental protection to everyone who handles a hazardous product or who could be exposed to one.\n\nIn the countries in which GHS is implemented in local regulations, Air Liquide subsidiaries have implemented the principles of GHS in terms of product compliance in accordance with the requirements set out in local regulations.\n\n## 5.2.10. Notification to Poisons Centers (Regulation 1272/2008/EC, Annex VIII)\n\nThe notification to the national emergency services (Poison Centers) of the composition and numbers of any mixture placed on the market will be mandatory from 2021 in Europe, both for usual mixtures and for mixtures made on demand.\n\nThis process requires obtaining a unique identification number (UFI code) at the European level, which must also be indicated on the labels of bottles and products. Transit through a depot center also requires a UFI code in the country concerned.\n\n## 5.2.11. Seveso Directive 3\n\nThis European directive concerns the prevention of major industrial risks. It applies to any facility where certain hazardous substances are present above certain quantities. These facilities are classified into two categories according to the quantity of substances present: Seveso 3 \u00abupper tier\u00bb and \u00ablower tier\u00bb. In Europe, 94 \u00ablower tier\u00bb and 28 \u00abupper tier\u00bb Air Liquide sites are concerned, mainly because of oxygen storage.\n\nSeveso regulations apply mainly in Europe, but if the Seveso 'upper tier' criteria were to be applied worldwide, 34 other Group sites would be covered.",

PROTOCOL AND DEFINITIONS\n\nIn the absence of a relevant and recognized protocol for industrial gas operations, Air Liquide has created its own protocol to define its reporting methods for Human Resources, safety and environmental indicators. This protocol includes all of the definitions, measurement procedures and collection methods for this information. In line with the Group's commitment to continuous improvement, Air Liquide is gradually completing this work to adjust its Sustainable Development indicators protocol to reflect changes in the Group.\n\nThis protocol is based on the general principles defined by the Group with regard to scope, responsibilities, controls and limits, and establishes definitions, departmental responsibilities, tools and\n\n## 6.2. SCOPE AND CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nHuman Resources and environmental indicators are consolidated worldwide for all companies integrated within the financial consolidation scope. Entities accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the reporting scope.\n\nSafety indicators are consolidated worldwide for all companies in which Air Liquide has operational control or is responsible for safety management.\n\nApart from these general rules, there are some specific ones:\n\n- \u25a0 information on the impact of transportation (kilometers traveled, CO2 emitted) is calculated based on data collected in the main countries where the Group is established;\n- \u25a0 information on avoided kilometers and avoided CO2 emissions through on-site Air Separation Units and efficiency measures pertains to fully consolidated subsidiaries within the financial consolidation scope;\n\ndata-tracing methods for each indicator. This document is regularly updated. Moreover, this protocol takes into account all the Group's formalized procedures in the framework of the Industrial Management System (IMS) and the global protocol for Group Policies, Codes and Procedures called the BlueBook. This reporting protocol makes it possible\n\nto cover the information listed in articles L. 22-10-36 and R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, except for the fight against food waste, food insecurity, respect for animal welfare and commitments to responsible, fair and sustainable food. Due to its industrial activity, these subjects are not considered a priority by Air Liquide.\n\n- \u25a0 environmental and energy indicators for the main types of production units operated by the Group cover about 99% of the Group's Gas & Services revenue and 98% of the Group's total revenue;\n- \u25a0 for environmental and energy indicators, production units are included in the reporting system from the effective date of their industrial commissioning;\n- \u25a0 electricity consumption and the indirect CO2 emissions related to it are only taken into account when Air Liquide pays for this energy. Energy consumption of on-site units and water consumption specific to the sale of treated water (which is not part of the Group's core business) are excluded from the consolidation scope of the data. When the Group has cogeneration units in a country where ASUs are available, the indirect emissions from the electricity of these units are not taken into account;\n- \u25a0 the segmentation between advanced economies and developing economies, used for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, is the same as that used by the Finance Department.",

DATA COLLECTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe Human Resources, safety and environmental indicators are produced by several data collection systems in the Group, each under the responsibility of a specific department:\n\n- \u25a0 Human Resources indicators, included in the Group's general accounting consolidation tool, fall under the responsibility of the Human Resources Department;\n- \u25a0 the energy consumption and CO2 emissions indicators for the main Air Separation Units and cogeneration, hydrogen and carbon monoxide units are tracked by the Large Industries business line using a dedicated Intranet tool;\n- \u25a0 as a complement, environmental and safety reporting is carried out by the Safety and Industrial System Department using a dedicated Intranet tool, and includes:\n- - for all entities, the Group's accident reporting data,\n- - for the units of the Large Industries business line, other environmental indicators (atmospheric emissions, water consumption, discharge to water, etc.),\n- - for the smaller units (acetylene, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide units and Hygiene and Specialty Ingredients businesses), the Engineering & Construction business units, the Research and Development sites and the Technical Centers, all indicators (energy, atmospheric emissions, water consumption, discharge to water, etc.);\n- \u25a0 indicators on Industrial Merchant transportation are the responsibility of this business line;\n- \u25a0 indicators on transportation for Medical Gases and Home Healthcare are the responsibility of the Healthcare business line;\n- \u25a0 among the subjects covered by the French 'Grenelle 2' law, soil pollution and the consideration of noise pollution are not relevant for the Industrial Gas business, given the size of the Group's sites and the noise levels generated. They are therefore not mentioned in this report.\n\n## 6.4. CONTROLS\n\nEach department in charge of collecting data is responsible for the indicators provided. Control occurs at the time of consolidation (review of changes, inter-entity comparisons).\n\nSafety and energy indicators are tracked monthly. Where the data reported are inconsistent or missing, an estimated value may be used by default.\n\n## 6.5. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITS\n\nThe methodologies used for certain Human Resources, safety and environmental indicators can have certain limits due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the absence of nationally or internationally recognized definitions, in particular for indicators on managers and professionals and social performance indicators;\n- \u25a0 the representativeness of the measurements taken and required estimates. This is particularly the case for indicators regarding avoided CO2 emissions, water consumption, kilometers avoided per on-site unit, and training.",

After adjusting for the cumulative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, revenues was down by -4.5%. The latter essentially stemmed from the depreciation of the US dollar and to a lesser extent of the Brazilian real and the Argentina peso against the Euro.\n\nConsolidated net profit, after deduction of minority interests, amounted to 2,435.1 million euros, compared to 2,241.5 million euros in 2019, up +8.6% (up +11.2% excluding foreign exchange impact).\n\nThese results are detailed in the Management Report and the financial statements.\n\n## CROSSING OF SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS THRESHOLDS IN 2020\n\nPlease refer to the Chapter 'Additional Information' of this Universal Registration Document - page 381.\n\n## Investments and acquisition of controlling interests\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L. 233-6 of the French Commercial Code, there is no new transaction performed by L'Air Liquide S.A. in 2020.\n\n## Resolutions within the authority of the Ordinary General Meeting\n\nWe ask you, after having reviewed:\n\n- \u25a0 the Reports of the Board of Directors;\n- \u25a0 the Company's financial statements, income statement, balance sheet and notes thereto;\n- \u25a0 the Group's consolidated financial statements;\n- \u25a0 the Reports of the Statutory Auditors;\n\nto approve the Company's financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 as presented, as well as the transactions set out in these financial statements or mentioned in these reports.\n\nYour Company's net profit allows the Board to propose the payment of a dividend of 2.75 euros for each share entitled to a dividend, it being specified that in the event of a change in the number of shares entitled to a dividend compared to the 473,660,724 shares making up the share capital as of December 31, 2020, the overall dividend amount would be adjusted accordingly and the amount appropriated\n\nto the retained earnings account would be determined on the basis of the dividends effectively paid.\n\nThe proposed dividend amounts to 2.75 euros per share, up +1.9% compared to prior year and in line with the recurring net profit growth.\n\nThe ex-dividend date will be set for May 17, 2021. The dividend payment date will be set for May 19, 2021.\n\nIn accordance with article 117 quater of the French General Tax Code, it is specified that ordinary and loyalty dividends paid to individuals with their tax residence in France are fully subject to the single flat-rate withholding tax of 12.8%. Nonetheless, at the express, irrevocable and global request of the shareholder, these dividends may be subject to the progressive income tax rate and shall therefore be eligible for the 40% allowance referred to in section 2\u00b0 of paragraph 3 of article 158 of the French General Tax Code, which is applicable under certain conditions. In all cases, these ordinary and loyalty dividends shall also be subject to social contributions at a rate of 17.2%.",

These shares, each with a par value of 5.50 euros, represent 0.27% of the Company's share capital.\n\n1,113,830 shares are assigned for implementation of any performance share plans and 165,000 shares are assigned to the objective of cancellation.\n\nUnder the liquidity contract, as of December 31, 2020, a total of 11,000 shares were on the balance sheet for a net value of 1,475,701 euros.\n\n## B. Draft resolution\n\nAs the authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 5, 2020 was partially used, the Board proposes to replace it with a new authorization to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them, subject to the adoption of the 14 th resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender them following the exercise of rights attached to marketable securities conferring entitlement to Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions reserved for members of a Company Savings Plan, performed under the terms and conditions set forth in articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code through the transfer of shares bought back previously by the Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount; or (iv)\n\nallocation of shares to employees and/or Executive Officers and Directors of the Company and affiliated companies, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force;\n\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a liquidity contract in accordance with the market practice recognized by the French financial market authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers).\n\nThe maximum purchase price will be set at 200 euros (excluding acquisition costs) per share with a par value of 5.50 euros per share, and the maximum number of shares that can be bought back will be set at 10% of the total number of shares making up the share capital as of December 31, 2020, or 47,366,072 shares with a par value of 5.50 euros, for a maximum total amount of 9,473,214,400 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nAs the objective of retaining shares and subsequently tendering them within the scope of external growth transactions is no longer considered an accepted market practice under the new European regulations, it is not provided in the draft resolution.\n\nAs in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization does not apply during takeover bid periods. These shares may thus be purchased at any time, excluding the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all available means, either on or off a stock exchange, over-the-counter, including the purchase of blocks of shares, or through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of the last paragraph of article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any manner on or off a stock exchange or over-the-counter, including the sale of blocks of shares, in accordance with the applicable regulations.\n\nDividends on treasury shares held by the Company shall be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThis authorization shall be granted for a period of 18 months starting from the date of this General Meeting. It shall be valid as of the date of the Board of Directors meeting called to decide on the implementation of the share buy-back program and, at the latest, as of November 4, 2021. It supersedes the authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 5, 2020 in its 4 th resolution with respect to its non-utilized portion.\n\n## RENEWAL OF A DIRECTOR'S TERM OF OFFICE AND APPOINTMENT OF THREE DIRECTORS\n\nThe Board of Directors currently comprises 13 members: 11 members appointed by the General Meeting, including six foreign nationals and six women (i.e. 55%) and two Directors representing the employees, following the appointment of Fatima Tighlaline on October 1, 2020. The percentage of independent Directors is 82%.\n\nThe terms of office of Thierry Peugeot and Xavier Huillard will expire at the end of this General Meeting.\n\nRegarding Thierry Peugeot, on the Appointments and Governance Committee's recommendation and in agreement with Mr Peugeot who will have served 16 years on the Board of Directors, the Board has decided that as part of good governance Mr. Peugeot's term of office will not be proposed to the General Meeting for renewal. Mr Peugeot was very warmly thanked for his contribution to the work of the Board of Directors, of which he has been a member since 2005, and to the work of the Audit and Accounts Committee, of which he has been a member since 2012.",

This authorization granted to the Board of Directors will be for a period of 24 months.\n\n## INCREASE IN SHARE CAPITAL VIA THE ISSUANCE OF ORDINARY SHARES OR MARKETABLE SECURITIES CONFERRING ENTITLEMENT TO THE COMPANY'S SHARE CAPITAL, WITH RETENTION OF PREFERENTIAL SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS\n\nTo finance the Group's growth investments, shareholders are asked in the 15 th resolution to renew the delegation granted to the Board of Directors to increase the share capital for a maximum nominal amount of 470 million euros corresponding to around 18% of the share capital as of December 31, 2020, by issuing, on one or more occasions, ordinary shares or compound dilutive marketable securities. The shareholders shall have, in proportion to the amount of shares they own, a preferential subscription right to the shares or to the marketable securities issued.\n\nThe Group has not made use of the previous delegation approved by the May 7, 2019 Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nThis delegation of authority is valid for a period of 26 months.\n\nThe total amount of capital increases carried out pursuant to the 16 th resolution below and any resolutions allowing employees and Executive Officers to benefit from shares (13 th and 14 th resolutions of the May 7, 2019 Extraordinary General Meeting) and to the resolutions which allow the implementation of employee share ownership transactions (17 th and 18 th resolutions submitted to this General Meeting for approval) is also deducted from this ceiling of 470 million euros.\n\nAs in 2019, in order to provide shareholders with the right to express an opinion on the issues subject to this delegation of authority during periods of takeover bids, it is proposed that this delegation of authority is suspended during periods of takeover bids.\n\nIn the event of oversubscription, the 16 th resolution authorizes the amount of the issue to be increased, within the legal limits of 15% of the ceiling of 470 million euros.\n\n## CAPITAL INCREASE RESERVED FOR EMPLOYEES WITH CANCELLATION OF SHAREHOLDER PREFERENTIAL SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS\n\nIn accordance with legal provisions, these draft resolutions are submitted again to the vote at the General Meeting. The two resolutions proposed to the General Meeting are identical to those approved on May 5, 2020.\n\nShareholders, having read the Board of Directors' Report and the Statutory Auditors' Special Report, are therefore asked to authorize the Board of Directors to decide one or more share capital increases, at the time or times and in the proportions that it deems appropriate, via the issuance of ordinary shares of the Company, as well as other marketable securities granting access to the Company's share capital, reserved for:\n\n- \u25a0 under the 17 th resolution, the members, from the Company and the French or foreign companies which are affiliated to it within the meaning of article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and article L. 3344-1 of the French Labor Code, of a Company or Group Savings Plan (directly or through a Company mutual fund or all other structures or entities permitted by applicable legal or regulatory provisions). The delegation shall be valid for a period of 26 months starting from the date of this General Meeting;\n- \u25a0 under the 18 th resolution, a category of beneficiaries, defined as any bank or subsidiary of such an institution mandated by the Company, which would subscribe to shares, or other share capital issued by the Company pursuant to the 17 th resolution, with the sole intent of enabling employees and corporate officers of foreign companies, affiliated to the Company within the meaning of article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and article  L. 3344-1 of the French Labor Code, to benefit from a plan with an economic profile comparable to an employee share ownership scheme that would be set up in connection with a share capital increase undertaken in accordance with the 17 th resolution of this General Meeting, taking into account the regulatory and fiscal and/or social framework applicable in the country of residence of the employees and corporate officers of the aforementioned foreign companies. The delegation shall be valid for a period of 18 months starting from the date of this General Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall be competent to determine, within those categories, the identity of the beneficiaries of these share capital increases.\n\nThe total amount of share capital increases likely to be performed in accordance with these two resolutions may not exceed a maximum nominal amount of 22 million euros, corresponding to the issue of a maximum of 4 million shares. Furthermore, the maximum nominal amount of share capital increases likely to be performed on the basis of these two resolutions shall be deducted from the overall limit stipulated in paragraph 2 of the 15 th resolution this Extraordinary General Meeting. In the event that they are used, the proposed resolutions will automatically result in the cancellation of the shareholders' preferential subscription rights in favor of the above-mentioned beneficiaries.",

In accordance with article L. 3332-21 of the French Labor Code, the Board of Directors may provide for the attribution, on a bonus basis, to the beneficiaries referred to in the 17 th resolution, of shares to be issued or already issued or other marketable securities granting access to the Company's share capital to be issued or already issued, in respect of (i) the contribution that\n\ncould be paid in accordance with the regulations governing Company or Group Saving Plans, and/or (ii) where appropriate, the discount.\n\nShould the beneficiaries referred to in the 17 th resolution not subscribe to the entire share capital increase within the allotted deadlines, the share capital increase would only be performed for the amount of the shares subscribed, and the non-subscribed shares may be offered again to the beneficiaries concerned within the scope of a subsequent share capital increase.\n\nFinally, the shareholders shall grant full powers to the Board of Directors, with the option of sub-delegation under the conditions determined by law, to set, within the limits described above, the various terms and conditions governing the implementation of the two proposed resolutions.",

The Board also intends to maintain the liquidity contract in place, in accordance with AMF regulations.\n\nAs in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization does not apply during takeover bid periods.\n\n## Fourth Resolution\n\n(Authorization granted to the Board of Directors for a period of 18 months to allow the Company to trade in its own shares)\n\nThe shareholders, deliberating according to the quorum and majority required for Ordinary General Meetings, after having reviewed the Report of the Board of Directors, in accordance with articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the directly applicable provisions of European Commission Regulation No. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014, authorize the Board of Directors to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them, subject to the adoption of the fourteenth resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender them following the exercise of rights attached to marketable securities conferring entitlement to Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions reserved for members of a Company Savings Plan, performed under the terms and conditions set forth in articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code through the transfer of shares bought back previously by the Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) share grants to employees and/or Executive Officers of the Company or affiliated companies;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a liquidity contract in accordance with the market practice recognized by the French financial market authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers).\n\nThe shareholders set the maximum purchase price at 200 euros (excluding acquisition costs) per share with a par value of 5.50 euros and the maximum number of shares that can be bought back at 10% of the total number of shares comprising the share capital at December 31, 2020, i.e. 47,366,072 shares with a par value of 5.50 euros, for a maximum total amount of 9,473,214,400 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nThese shares may be purchased at any time, excluding the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all available means, either on or off a stock exchange, over-the-counter, including the purchase of blocks of shares, or through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of the final paragraph of article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any manner on or off a stock exchange or over-the-counter, including the sale of blocks of shares, in accordance with the applicable regulations.\n\nDividends on treasury shares held by the Company shall be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThis authorization is granted for a period of 18 months starting from the date of this General Meeting.

It may also be increased by exercising the rights attached to marketable securities granting access to share capital, under the conditions stipulated by law.\n\nIn accordance with prevailing legal provisions, unless otherwise decided by the General Meeting, the shareholders have, in proportion to the amount of shares they own, a preferential subscription right to the shares issued in cash in order to increase share capital.\n\nThe share capital may also be reduced under the conditions stipulated by law, in particular, by reducing the par value of the shares, or by reimbursing or redeeming shares on the stock exchange and by canceling shares, or by exchanging existing shares for new shares, in an equivalent or lesser number, with or without the same par value, and with or without a cash balance to be paid or received. The General Meeting may always compel the shareholders to sell or purchase existing shares to permit the exchange of existing shares for new shares, with or without a cash balance to be paid or received, even if such reduction is not a result of losses.\n\n## Article 6: Shares\n\nIf the new shares are not fully paid up upon issuance, calls for payment shall be performed, on dates set by the Board of Directors, by means of announcements posted one month in advance in one of the Paris official legal publications chosen for the legal publication of the Company's deeds.\n\nShares not fully paid up shall be held as registered shares until they are fully paid up.\n\nEach payment on any subscribed shares will be registered in an account opened in the name of the subscriber.\n\nAll late payments shall automatically bear interest, for the benefit of the Company, as of the due date, without any formal notice or legal action, at the legal interest rate, subject to any personal action that the Company may take against any defaulting shareholder and the compulsory execution measures provided by law.\n\n## Article 7: Type of shares\n\nPaid-up shares are registered as registered shares or bearer shares depending on the choice of the shareholder.\n\nThe provisions of the aforementioned paragraph also apply to other securities of any nature issued by the Company.\n\n## Article 8: Rights and obligations governing shares\n\nShareholders shall not be liable above the amount of their subscription.\n\nShare ownership automatically binds shareholders to the articles of association and the decisions of the General Meetings.\n\nSubject to legal and regulatory restrictions, voting rights attached to the shares are proportionate to the capital quota they represent and each share confers the right to one vote. In accordance with the\n\noption provided for in paragraph 3 of article L. 225-123 of the French Commercial Code, double voting rights will not be conferred to paid-up shares and for which a nominative registration for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder can be proved.\n\nAny share grants entitlement, during the Company's term, as in the event of liquidation, to the payment of an identical net amount for any distribution or redemption.\n\nShares are freely transferable under the conditions provided by law.\n\n## Article 9: Identification of shareholders\n\nThe Company may avail itself at any time of the legal and statutory provisions in force permitting the identification of the owners of shares conferring immediately or in the future the right to vote in General Meetings, as well as the number of shares they own.\n\nIn addition to the legal obligations to notify the Company, any person, acting alone or jointly, coming in direct or indirect possession of a fraction of the Company's capital or voting rights equal to or greater than 2%, or a multiple of 2% of capital or voting rights (including above the 5% threshold), is required to inform the Company within fifteen days as of the date on which the threshold is exceeded and, as the case may be, independently of the effective transfer date of share ownership. The person shall state the number of shares and marketable securities granting entitlement to capital that he or she owns on the date of notification. Any decrease below the 2% threshold or a multiple of 2% of capital or voting rights shall be notified in the same manner.\n\nTo determine share capital and voting rights thresholds, the crossing of which must be declared under the previous paragraph, assimilation rules set out in article L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code are applied.\n\nIn the event of a failure to meet this additional notification obligation, one or several shareholders, owning a fraction of the Company's capital or voting rights amounting to at least 2%, may, at a General Meeting, request that the shares exceeding the fraction which should have been reported, be stripped of their voting rights for any General Meeting held until the end of a two-year period following the date on which the notice is rectified. The request is recorded in the Minutes of the General Meeting.\n\n## Article 10: Co-ownership and usufruct\n\nAs all shares are indivisible from the point of view of the Company, all joint owners of shares are required to be represented vis-\u00e0-vis the Company by a single owner selected from among them or proxy under the conditions provided by law.\n\nThe voting right attached to the share is exercised by the beneficial owner at both Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meetings. However, the bare-owner shall be entitled to attend all General Meetings. He or she may also represent the beneficial owner at General Meetings.\n\nThe heirs, creditors, trustees or successors of a shareholder may not, on any grounds whatsoever, call for the affixing of seals on the Company's assets and securities, request the distribution thereof, or interfere in any manner whatsoever in its administration.\n\nIn order to exercise their rights, they must consult the Company's records and decisions of the General Meetings.",

As an exception to this rule, the members of the first Board of Directors who exercised functions as members of the Supervisory Board in the Company under its former mode of administration shall be appointed for a period equal to the remaining term of their mandate as members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors may be re-elected.\n\nEach Director must own at least 500 registered shares in the Company during the term of his functions. If, on the date of his appointment, a Director does not own the required number of shares or if, during his term, he ceases to own them, he is deemed to have resigned with immediate effect if he has not rectified the situation within a period of three months.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy of one or more seats due to death or resignation, the Board of Directors may, between two General Meetings, make temporary appointments. Provisional appointments made by the Board of Directors are subject to the approval of the next Ordinary General Meeting. If the number of Directors falls below the legal minimum, the remaining Directors must immediately convene an Ordinary General Meeting in order to make up the numbers of the Board.\n\nNo individual over the age of 70 shall be appointed as a member of the Board of Directors if his appointment increases the number of the members of the Board of Directors who have passed this age to over one third. If during their term, the number of the members of the Board of Directors who have passed 70 years of age exceeds one third of the Board's members, the oldest member of the Board of Directors who has not carried out management functions in the Company is deemed to have resigned at the end of the Annual General Meeting held following the occurrence of this event.\n\nDuring the Company's term, Directors are appointed and their mandates renewed under the conditions provided by law.\n\nThey may be dismissed by the Ordinary General Meeting at any time.\n\n## Director(s) representing employees\n\nIn accordance with statutory requirements, if the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is less than or equal to eight, the Group Committee in France shall proceed to appoint a Director representing employees.\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is more than eight, and provided this criterion is still fulfilled on the date of the appointment, a second Director representing employees shall be appointed by the European Works Council.\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial\n\nCode, was originally more than eight members but becomes less than or equal to eight members, the Director appointed by the European Works Council shall remain in office until his term of office expires.\n\nAs an exception to the foregoing, the Director representing employees appointed by virtue of this clause is not required to hold at least 500 registered shares during his term of office.\n\nThe Director representing employees shall be appointed for a four-year term expiring at the close of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the previous year and which is held in the year in which his term of office expires. The tenure of the Director representing employees may be renewed.\n\nThe tenure of the Director representing employees shall be terminated in accordance with statutory requirements and the provisions contained in this clause, particularly in the event of termination of said Director's employment contract; if the criteria for the application of article L. 225-27-1 of the Commercial Code are no longer met, the tenure of the Director(s) representing employees shall expire at the end of the meeting during which the Board of Directors observes that the Company has been released from this obligation.\n\nIn the event that the seat of a Director representing employees is vacant for any reason whatsoever, the vacant seat shall be filled under the conditions set forth in article L. 225-34 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn addition to the provisions of the second paragraph of article L. 225-29 of the French Commercial Code, it is stipulated, if need be, that any failure to appoint a Director representing employees by the body designated herein, in accordance with the law and with this clause, shall not invalidate the resolutions of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Article 12: Organization and management of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors elects from among its members who are individuals, a Chairman. It determines his remuneration and sets his term of office which may not exceed his term of office as Director. The Chairman may be re-elected.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors performs the duties entrusted to him by law. He chairs the Board of Directors, organizes and manages its work and reports on such work to the General Meeting. He ensures that the Company's bodies operate properly and, in particular, that the Directors are able to fulfill their assignments.\n\nThe Board may also appoint from among its members one or more Vice Chairmen, whose term of office shall be determined within the limit of their term as Director and whose role it is, subject to the legal provisions applicable in the event of the temporary impediment or death of the Chairman, to convene and chair Board meetings or chair General Meetings in accordance with these articles of association when the Chairman is impeded.\n\nNo Director who does not also assume the role of Chief Executive Officer may be appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors after the age of 70 (or 72 if the Board decides at its discretion to derogate from this limit in exceptional circumstances). If, during the term of office, this age limit is reached, the Chairman's mandate shall terminate at the close of the General Meeting held to approve the financial statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit.\n\nIf the Chairman of the Board of Directors also assumes the role of Chief Executive Officer, the applicable age limit is that applicable to the Chief Executive Officer.",

The Board of Directors makes its decision relating to the choice of General Management organization under the quorum and majority conditions stipulated in article 14 of these articles of association. The shareholders and third parties are informed of the Board of Directors' decision under the conditions stipulated by the regulations in force.\n\nWhen the Company's General Management is assumed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors must appoint, among its members considered as independent by the Board of Directors, a Lead Director. The conditions of appointment, the tasks and powers of the Lead Director (in particular, if applicable, the power to ask to convene a meeting of the Board of Directors), are set out in the Board of Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe choice made by the Board of Directors remains valid until it decides otherwise.\n\nThe Board of Directors will review, as necessary, the choice made each time the mandate of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer comes up for renewal.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer\n\nIf the Company's Chief Executive Officer is assumed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the following provisions relating to the Chief Executive Officer are applicable.\n\nThe Board of Directors sets the term of office and determines the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nNo individual over the age limit set by law may be appointed as Chief Executive Officer. If, during the term of office, this age limit is reached, the Chief Executive Officer's mandate shall terminate at the close of the General Meeting held to approve the financial statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit set by law.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. The discharge of a Chief Executive Officer who does not assume the role of Chairman may give rise to damages if decided without reasonable cause.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may always be re-elected.\n\n## Powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company within the limit of the Company's corporate purpose, the articles of association, and subject to the powers expressly granted by law to General Meetings and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for defining the decisions of the Chief Executive Officer that require its prior approval. The Board of Directors' prior approval should be sought particularly for external acquisitions or sales of interests or assets, and for investment\n\n## General information\n\ncommitments, in each case under the conditions and exceeding the amounts corresponding to an efficient operation of the Company as set by the Board of Directors. It should also be sought for financing operations of any amount likely to substantially alter the Company's financial structure and for any decision likely to substantially alter the Company's strategic orientations determined by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Senior Executive Vice-Presidents\n\nOn the Chief Executive Officer's proposal, whether he be Chairman of the Board of Directors or any other person, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more physical persons as Senior Executive Vice-Presidents to assist the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe maximum number of Senior Executive Vice Presidents is set at three.\n\nIn accordance with the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors determines the scope and term of the powers granted to the Senior Executive Vice Presidents and sets their remuneration.\n\nThe Senior Executive Vice Presidents have the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer vis-\u00e0-vis third parties.\n\nIn the event of impediment of the Chief Executive Officer or the cessation of his functions, the Senior Executive Vice Presidents shall maintain, unless decided otherwise by the Board of Directors, their functions and powers until a new Chief Executive Officer is appointed.\n\nThe Senior Executive Vice Presidents may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors, at the Chief Executive Officer's proposal. They are subject to the age limit provided by law.\n\nSenior Executive Vice-Presidents may be re-elected.\n\n## Article 14: Board of Directors' Meetings and deliberations\n\nThe Board of Directors meets as often as the interest of the Company so requires, by notice from its Chairman or in the case of impediment, from the oldest Vice Chairman, if one or more Vice Chairmen have been appointed, at the Head Office or in any other location indicated in the Notice of Meeting.\n\nThe agenda is set by the Chairman and may only be finalized at the time of the meeting.\n\nDirectors representing at least one third of members of the Board of Directors may, while specifying the meeting's agenda, ask the Chairman to summon the Board if it has not met for more than two months.\n\nLikewise, the Chief Executive Officer, if he does not chair the Board of Directors, may ask the Chairman to summon the Board of Directors on any specified agenda.\n\nThe Chairman is bound to the requests made to him.\n\nIn the event that the Chairman is impeded or fails in performing the aforementioned tasks, the oldest Vice Chairman, if one or more Vice Chairmen have been appointed, shall have the authority to call the Board and set the meeting's agenda at the request of at least one third of members of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be.

This deduction ceases to be mandatory when the reserve amounts to 10% of the share capital. It is resumed if this reserve is ever used.\n\nThe distributable profits are made up of the annual net profits, less previous losses, as well as the sums to be placed on reserve pursuant to law, plus the profit carried forward.\n\nFrom these profits, a deduction is made of the amount necessary to pay the shareholders, as a first dividend, 5% of the sums paid-up on their shares, and not amortized, and 5% of the sums from premiums on shares issued in cash, and appearing in a 'share premium' account, without it being possible, if the profits of a given year do not permit this payment, for the shareholders to claim such amounts from the profits of subsequent years.\n\nThe General Meeting may decide to earmark any portion of the available surplus of said profits it wishes for the creation of general or special providence or reserve funds, under any name whatsoever or even simply as an amount carried forward.\n\nThe balance constitutes a surplus fund which is intended for the distribution of the second dividend as well as the amount provisionally assessed as necessary to pay a 10% increase to the registered shares satisfying the following conditions.\n\nStarting on January 1, 1996, the shares registered at December 31 of each year in registered form for at least two years, and which remain registered until the date of the payment of the dividend, will entitle their owners to collect a dividend per share which is 10% higher, rounded down if necessary to the lower centime, than the dividend per share distributed in respect of other shares, provided that the amount of the dividend per share prior to any increase is at least equal to the amount of the dividend per share prior to any increase distributed in the preceding year, adjusted to take into account the change in the number of shares from one year to the next resulting in a capital increase by capitalizing premiums, reserves or profits or a share split.\n\nIn the event that, starting on January 1, 1996, the Board of Directors, with the approval of the shareholders decides to increase the capital by capitalizing reserves, profits or premiums, the registered shares held on December 31 prior to the attribution for at least two years and that remain held until the day before the share attribution date will entitle their owners to an attribution of shares which is 10% higher than the attribution made in favor of other shares, and according to the same procedure.\n\nThe new shares created in this manner will be comparable in all respects to the existing shares from which they are issued, for calculating the entitlement to the higher dividends and the higher attributions.\n\nThe increases defined in each of the two preceding paragraphs may be modified or eliminated by simple decision during the Extraordinary General Meeting, according to the procedures it determines.\n\nPursuant to law, the number of shares eligible for these increases shall not for any given shareholder exceed 0.5% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe General Meeting held to approve the financial statements for the year shall have the possibility of granting to each shareholder, for all or part of the dividend or interim dividends, an option for payment of the dividend or interim dividends in either cash or shares.",
