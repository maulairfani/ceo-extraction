Rough ones, smooth ones. They may\n\nlook different, but they have something in common - they all need\n\ncoating.\n\nWe've been inventing the future of coatings since 1792. As\n\npioneers in bringing surfaces to life, there's a good chance\n\nyou're only ever a few meters away from one of our products.\n\nIn fact, our world class portfolio of brands is trusted by\n\ncustomers around the globe.\n\nOur visionary approach means we constantly embrace new\n\nideas to keep us at the forefront of the industry. It's what\n\nyou'd expect from the most sustainable coatings\n\ncompany (see page 29).\n\n1792\n\nsince\n\n## WHAT WE DO\n\nWe're experts in making coatings, although that hardly begins to tell the whole story. We use our passion for paint to make a difference - both big and small. So the things our products can do may surprise you, whether they're applied to boats, buildings, cars, planes, phones, walls or wood.\n\nOur coatings can give a surface a personality - or even a superpower - like the ability to purify indoor air, harness solar energy and transform spaces with color. So we never stand still. Because there are industries to reinvent, environments to protect and boundaries to push. As global pioneers, it's in our nature to keep learning, keep discovering and keep innovating (see page 15).",

        "page_content": "As 2020 began, we were all set for accelerating towards our Winning together: 15 by 20 ambition. However, like everybody else, it wasn't long before we encountered unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The massive economic and social impacts were felt by everyone as the world came to a virtual standstill. Despite the odds being stacked against us, I'm proud to say we reacted fast and reached a significant milestone as a company.\n\nOur people and customers came first. That was always our priority. At the same time, as the global pandemic raged on, we mobilized the whole organization in response. We became more agile, changed our ways of working and focused on a handful of priorities to ensure we kept the company intact and continued to serve our customers - eventually deciding to pause key parts of our transformation and suspend our 2020 financial ambition.\n\nWe saved costs, closely managed cash and leveraged the solid processes and systems we've been putting in place to set the company up for success. The fact that we weathered the storm so well demonstrates our new-found resilience and I'm extremely proud of how we continued to look after our customers and performed together as an organization.\n\nAs the year came to an end, we almost overlooked the fact that all our hard work during the last three years paid off - we reached our Winning together: 15 by 20 ambition, despite the unparalleled headwinds. After this extraordinary phase of our ongoing journey, we're now a significantly leaner paints and coatings company, with clear and short communication lines, and systems and processes in place that enable us to continue delivering value for all our stakeholders. We also continue to streamline our manufacturing and warehouse footprint.\n\nAchieving this significant 15 by 20 milestone is very much the culmination of a determined push to get back to the forefront of our industry and we continue to see encouraging momentum in our business performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver the last three years, we've made a series of targeted acquisitions. In 2020, we added Stahl's powder coatings activities and New Nautical Coatings' yacht business in North America, while a deal was also agreed for Titan decorative paints in Spain (to be completed in 2021) and we finalized the acquisition of Mauvilac Industries Limited in Mauritius. At the same time, we've clearly claimed the innovation space with our industry-first Paint the Future ecosystem.\n\nWe're now moving forward with our new Grow & Deliver strategy - the next stage of our transformation - building on what we've achieved to truly become the reference in our industry. It's about outperforming our markets on growth and continuing to deliver to the bottom line - which we were already doing during the second half of 2020. By remaining customer focused and keeping our discipline on margins and costs, during the next three years, we aim to deliver an average 50 basis points improvement in return on sales each year.\n\nAs we enter the newest phase of our journey in 2021, we continue to evolve, led by a new company purpose which demonstrates our passion for pioneering a world of possibilities to bring surfaces to life. And we continue to build on our leading track record when it comes to sustainability, through our 'People. Planet. Paint.' approach and related ambitions.\n\nOf course, by far the real driving force is our people, who deserve all the credit. It's been a tough journey at times, but everyone persevered and I'm really proud of what we've shown the world this year. Our improved organizational health score suggests that engagement is strong and there's a good feeling within the company.\n\nSo a huge thank you to the whole organization. For myself and the whole Executive Committee, it continues to be a privilege to be on this journey to become the frontrunner in our industry.\n\nThierry Vanlancker , CEO and Chairman of the Board of Management and Executive Committee",

We had bold aspirations and few people believed it was possible to achieve them.\n\nBefore looking at how the milestone was achieved, it's worth refl ecting on where Winning together: 15 by 20 came from. Prior to 2015, AkzoNobel was at the\n\nbottom of the pack when benchmarking profi tability versus peers. And while we managed to make our way up into ahead of us by a signifi cant distance.\n\nthe middle, some players were still Our 15 by 20 fi nancial ambition was all about closing that gap.\n\nCreating two focused companies was clearly the most logical step. We therefore separated our Specialty Chemicals business within 12 months, as planned, and returned \u20ac6.5 billion proceeds to shareholders before the end of 2019, as promised. Which saw us become a truly focused paints and coatings company.\n\nWe took a conscious decision to scale down revenue growth aspirations and focus solely on return on sales (ROS). This would improve the quality of the business - shedding some structurally unprofi table volumes - while recognizing the relatively slow growth rate in end markets.\n\nOur single-minded focus on profi tability created a clear and simple message for the whole organization, which meant decisions became much simpler to make - do whatever action results in the largest increase in ROS, while respecting our core values of safety, integrity and sustainability. It became a mantra. Winning together: 15 by 20 relied on a signifi cant amount of self-help, improving\n\nsystems and processes to create a stronger foundation for the future, with no support from end markets.\n\nSo we were well prepared for the fi nal phase of the 15 by 20 journey, when COVID-19 forced us to pause key parts of our transformation and suspend our 2020 fi nancial ambition. We focused on taking care of our employees while protecting our business, minimizing all discretionary costs and carefully managing cash and working capital. The signifi cant market disruption meant we occasionally had challenges in keeping up with rapid changes in demand. We took all reasonable steps to maintain business operations and continue serving customers. The actions taken, together with our strong balance sheet, provided a solid platform for us to resume key parts of the transformation during the second half of 2020.\n\nOur strict focus has paid off, delivering a step-change in performance in just a few short years. ROS (excluding unallocated cost) increased from 10.6% in 2017 to 15.0% in 2020. At the same time, we continued to advance in other areas, such as our industry-leading Paint the Future innovation ecosystem and our People. Planet. Paint. approach to sustainable business.\n\nBy the end of 2020, we'd reached a signifi cant milestone. We've reignited our passion for paint, caught up with the leading paints and coatings players and are well on our way to becoming the frontrunner in the industry - and we're just half-way through our transformation.\n\nBeyond 2020, our focus will now shift to growth and profi tability improvement, guided by our Grow & Deliver strategy. Ultimately, our goal is to be an industry leader in both size and performance.",

On September 2, 2020, the acquisition of Stahl's per-formance powder coatings activities was completed. On October 19, 2020, the acquisition of Titan Paints in Spain was announced, with completion expected in 2021. The acquisition of New Nautical Coatings in the US was completed in Q4 of 2020.\n\n## Raw material price development\n\nRaw material and other variable costs were \u20ac135 million lower in 2020, compared with 2019.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\nAdjusted operating income was up 11% at \u20ac1,099 million (2019: \u20ac991 million); driven by margin management and cost-saving programs.

Additional details about the performance of AkzoNobel and each business segment in 2020 can be found in the quarterly publications on our website.\n\n## Operating income\n\nOperating income was up at \u20ac963 million (2019: \u20ac841 million) and included negative identifi ed items of \u20ac136 million (\u20ac22 million in Decorative Paints, \u20ac35 million in Performance Coatings and \u20ac79 million in Other activities), mainly related to transformation costs. In 2019, identifi ed items were negative \u20ac150 million, mainly related to transformation costs and non-cash impairments, partly offset by a gain on disposal of \u20ac54 million following asset network optimization. OPI margin increased to 11.3% (2019: 9.1%).\n\n## Net fi nancing income and expenses\n\nNet fi nancing expenses decreased by \u20ac7 million, mainly due to lower interest on loans.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe effective tax rate was 26.2% (2019: 29.3%). The decrease is mainy related to impairments of deferred tax assets in 2019. Excluding identifi ed items, the effective tax rate in 2020 was 25.6% (2019: 25.3%).\n\n## Cash fl ows and net debt\n\nOperating activities in 2020 resulted in an infl ow of \u20ac1,220 million (2019: \u20ac33 million). This was mainly due to higher profi tability and changes in working capital, while 2019 was impacted by higher pension related payments.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, net debt was \u20ac1,034 million versus \u20ac802 million at year-end 2019. The net debt/EBITDA leverage ratio at December 31, 2020, was 0.8x (December 31, 2019: 0.7x).\n\n## Invested capital\n\nInvested capital at December 31, 2020, totaled \u20ac6.4 billion, \u20ac0.6 billion lower compared with year-end 2019, mainly due to a reduction in working capital and other non-current assets.\n\n## Dividend\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay a stable to rising dividend.

In 2020, a total share buyback of \u20ac545 million was completed.\n\n## Employees\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the number of employees was 32,200 (December 31, 2019: 33,800). Acquisitions in 2020 added around 250 people. For details on our approach to developing our workforce, see pages 32 to 34.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe pandemic situation is being closely monitored and appropriate measures are being taken to continue serving customers and save costs, while keeping the organization intact and able to respond quickly to changes in end market demand. Although demand trends differ per region and segment, the overall impact on AkzoNobel for the full-year 2020 was limited. An overall positive impact was noted for the Decorative Paints segment, while there was an overall adverse impact in the Performance Coatings segment. The pandemic has not impacted our going concern assumption.\n\nAkzoNobel has a strong balance sheet and solid cash position. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents\n\nwere \u20ac1.6 billion and fi nancial leverage (net debt/EBITDA) was 0.8x. AkzoNobel is committed to retain a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nIn 2020, a detailed assessment was performed of potential valuation adjustments to the overall asset base, either due to the direct impact of COVID-19, or its impact on future profi tability. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests have been performed based on most recently updated forecasts; this has not revealed impairments. Recoverability of deferred tax assets has also been reassessed based on these forecasts, leading to immaterial adjustments only. Furthermore, while the allowance for impairment of trade receivables initially increased as a direct result of the additional risk associated with COVID19, impairment of trade receivables returned to normal levels at year-end.\n\nIn 2020, a compensation of \u20ac33 million related to government support measures for COVID-19 was recognized as a reduction of employee benefi t costs, mainly in Q2 and Q3. No application was made for the \"Noodmaatregel Overbrugging voor Werkgelegenheid (NOW)\" in the Netherlands. In our 2020 fi gures, all COVID-19 related impacts have been treated as normal operations; none of these impacts have been included in identifi ed items.\n\n## Outlook 2021\n\nAkzoNobel targets to grow at least in line with its relevant markets. Although trends differ per region and segment with raw material infl ation expected, margin management and costsaving programs are in place to deliver 50 basis points increase in return on sales. The company targets a leverage ratio of 1-2 times net debt/EBITDA and commits to retain a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nSee Note 28 of the Consolidated fi nancial statements with regard to subsequent events.\n\nNumbers include AkzoNobel employees and temporary workers\n\nFor more details about our social performance, see the Sustainability statements.\n\n## SOCIAL VALUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Business as\n\nun\n\nusual\n\nBy any standards, 2020 was an extraordinary year. It therefore required an extraordinary response. As COVID-19 continued to tighten its grip on the world, our priority was to keep our employees, their families and our partners safe. At the same time, we did everything possible to continue supplying our customers, while giving whatever support we could to local communities.\n\nHere's a brief round-up of some of the projects we were involved with, many of which resulted from the amazing efforts of our colleagues around the world. They also highlight the strong social aspect of our 'People. Planet. Paint.' approach to sustainable business.\n\n## Rapid response in China\n\nWhen Chinese authorities announced they were about to rapidly construct a hospital in Yinchuan - capital city of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region the local AkzoNobel organization sprang into action.\n\nThe facility was being built as an expansion project at the existing Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia. However, as the work was taking place during the Spring Festival in February, paint was in short supply.\n\nOn hearing the news, we acted quickly to donate our Dulux Pro interior emulsion during the early days of the project. It helped to ensure that the new buildings could be completed on time (in just 15 days) as part of an urgent local response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe new buildings continued to be operational once the outbreak subsided.\n\n## Keeping industry going\n\nAs the pandemic raged, our customers con tinued to rely on us to supply products across a whole range of critical industries. So we had to prioritize our resources in certain areas to ensure production of essential items could continue.\n\nFor example, our coatings are used on hospital beds and other metal equipment (including oxygen bottles and ventilators), which were in high demand during the fi rst half of the year. We also supply coatings used in food and beverage cans, and the industry was working fl at out at one point to keep up with increased demand.\n\nMany of our coatings products including our decorative paints - are also a key part of the construction sector. So we were pulling out all the stops to ensure that crucial work could continue, such as building new hospitals. You can read about some of those projects elsewhere on these pages.\n\n## Coping with challenges in India\n\nDuring a nationwide lockdown in India, the local AkzoNobel organization launched several initiatives to help communities cope with the food and healthcare challenges.\n\nMany of these were adaptations of existing projects launched as part of the company's People. Planet. Paint. initiative. The focus was simply changed in response to the virus.\n\nFor example, in several villages near Bangalore, an existing e-health program which we helped to set up was used to provide initial screening for COVID19. Around 1,000 people had received symptomatic screening within the fi rst month.\n\nWe also provided essential food items to 6,000 people (mostly daily wage earners) in Gurgaon, Gwalior and Navi Mumbai, including underprivileged children studying at AkzoNobel supported education centers.\n\n## Beating the isolation blues in Brazil\n\nOne of the most heart-warming initiatives was organized in Brazil, where our colleagues made a big effort to help residents at a care home for elderly women, located in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nKnown as Grandma's House, it looks after nearly 200 elderly residents. However, due to the pandemic, visitors weren't allowed for many months. So our Brazilian colleagues decided to give the residents a boost and cheer them up by arranging video chat sessions to help them feel less isolated and alone.\n\nDozens of employees volunteered to take part during the initiative, when they could choose from a series of 30-minute time slots. 'The conversation I had was such an important moment for the lady I spoke to that she even dressed up specially for the occasion,' said AkzoNobel Administrative Coordinator, Roseli Franchi. 'It was very touching and made me realize that we can make a difference to people's lives by doing the simplest of things.'\n\nAs well as talking to the residents, employees were also given the opportunity to have donations sent from",

More than 1,000 items were sent, including cleaning and personal care products and food.\n\n## Supporting communities in Indonesia\n\nMany of the communities around our Cikarang site in Indonesia experienced the economic challenges that came with the large-scale social restrictions that resulted from the pandemic.\n\nHaving noticed the hardships many people were facing, colleagues from our local Marine and Protective Coatings and Decorative Paints sites responded quickly to help out.\n\nIn order to support the livelihoods of people in seven communities around Cikarang, several activities were organized under our AkzoNobel Cares umbrella, which included distributing basic food essentials to around 500 families in need.\n\n## Caring with color in Switzerland\n\nWith children often fi nding hospitals a bit scary, we worked with the Anouk Foundation in Switzerland to brighten things up and make one hospital in particular feel more comforting and colorful.\n\nThe Anouk Foundation is a non-profi t organization dedicated to bringing color to the walls of all kinds of buildings. Our Sikkens paint business has been donating paint to them for many years, helping to create designs and murals that calm the fears and worries of residents and patients of all ages.\n\nOne of their bigger projects in 2020 involved working on 22 treatment rooms and eight patient rooms at the Kinder Klinik Kantonsspital in the Swiss town of Aarau. Painting soft colors on the walls and introducing gentle humor helped create a comforting atmosphere, which proved especially important at a time of such global uncertainty.\n\nIn fact, the therapeutic value of the murals has been so benefi cial, there are plans to create more murals in other parts of the hospital, including the pediatric emergency unit.",

Ultimately, our goal is to take our rightful place as a frontrunner, both in terms of size and performance.\n\nThis ambition is refl ected in our new company purpose - Pioneering a world of possibilities to bring surfaces to life - which was developed with input from a broad range of employees and other stakeholders.

We're the leader in the fast-growing powder coatings segment, which currently contributes around 13% of revenue. Other segments also offer exciting growth opportunities, such as our decorative paints in South America and - driven by a shift away from single use plastics - packaging coatings.\n\nStrategic mandates - assigned per segment and region - are used to provide clear direction for each of our businesses, including relative priorities for growth and profi tability improvement.

Having been pioneers since 1792, we know what it means to go beyond when it comes to providing customers with quality solutions - how to understand and anticipate their needs. Our industry-leading Paint the Future innovation ecosystem is a great example of how our pioneering spirit is helping us to continue pushing boundaries.\n\nWe have a solid platform for adding to organic growth through targeted acquisitions.

Our pioneering spirit and our passion\n\nfor pushing the boundaries of our industry\n\nrepresent our past, present and future.\n\nFor us, innovation means going beyond conventional expectations, going beyond the imagination of our customers and going beyond generations. So it represents both a challenge and a promise.\n\nOur innovation portfolio is influenced by four main drivers: productivity, surface enhancement, asset protection and environmental protection. They guide us on our journey to making a significant and long-lasting difference to our customers and the planet.\n\n## Innovation in 2020\n\nDuring the year, we continued to introduce a range of ground-breaking products to the market, while expanding our digital capabilities. This included adding antimicrobial properties to our Interpon D1000 and 2000 range of architectural powder coatings, enabling building interiors to be given increased protection against microbes such as bacteria and mold. Our Powder Coatings business also introduced a new 3D color tool to help architects and specifiers find exactly the right product for their needs. Meanwhile, Decorative Paints introduced Dulux EasyCare+, which contains Scuff Resist technology to help protect interior walls, and also launched Hammerite Ultima, a rust-busting water-based exterior paint which can be applied directly onto any metal surface, without the need for a primer.\n\n## Collaborative innovation\n\nWe know great innovations happen when different people work together in a win-win model. A great example is our Operation Night Watch partnership with the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We're using our color expertise to work together on three key projects which demonstrate that understanding history is essential to building our future.\n\nFollowing its 2019 launch, we also made excellent progress with expanding our global Paint the Future collaborative innovation ecosystem - which is all about connecting what we know with what we don't yet know, so we can bring new solutions to the market faster.\n\n'Science and\n\ndrive our\n\ninnovation\n\nfuture and\n\nthis year's\n\nI'm proud\n\nsolutions\n\nbeyond\n\nwent\n\nexpectation\n\nvalue to\n\nto delive r\n\nus and our\n\ncustomers.'\n\nKlaas Kruithof,\n\nChief Technology\n\nOfficer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur latest Paint the Future regional startup challenge is scheduled to\n\ntake place in China in early 2021.

This included launching our first regional startup challenge in Brazil, which resulted in business proposals being awarded in four categories: Sustainable lifecycle; Smart supply chain and logistics; New functionalities; and Customer experience. A new regional startup challenge will be staged in China in 2021.\n\nThroughout the year, we also made good progress on joint developments in the area of robotic application, to help painters work more safely and efficiently. Two of these projects involve Qlayers and Apellix, both winners in our 2019 global startup challenge (see page 19). A third project is ongoing with French early stage startup Les Companions. This project is focused on developing a paint robot for interior use on walls and ceilings.\n\nIn addition, we advanced the work we're doing with two other 2019 winners. Alucha's circular filler is in the scale-up phase, while we're continuing to design new polymers for low-bake applications with Interface Polymers. Meanwhile, through our related Paint the Future supplier program, we also selected five new projects in 2020 for further acceleration. At the end of the year, a fully virtual supplier event was staged, featuring 100 specially invited participants.\n\nAnother successful project also emerged from a Paint the Future employee challenge.

Results were driven by disciplined pricing, innovation focused on premium offerings, better and broader store execution (including digital store launches) and cost-saving programs. We also experienced a steep increase in demand as consumers chose to renovate their homes during lockdown, with the help of our wideranging DIY (do-it-yourself) solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key brands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 HIGHLIGHT\n\nFour startups are collaborating with AkzoNobel after winning our Paint the Future Brazil startup challenge. We received 135 submissions, with 16 of the country's best startups being selected to participate in the challenge's fi nale held in S\u00e3o Paulo in early October. Awards were given to Aterra (Belo Horizonte); Getter (Curitiba) pictured left; nChemi (S\u00e3o Carlos); and Standout (S\u00e3o Paulo). Letters of intent have been signed, demon strating our commitment to co-developing sustainable business opportunities.\n\n## OTHER KEY DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- \u00b7   Introduced the Holding Hands program to support painters and consumers during COVID-19. It included partnerships with customers to help painters via training and food distribution\n- \u00b7   Launched our Coral and Pinturerias del Centro online stores\n- \u00b7  New Sparlack Cetol product lines for woodcare introduced in Brazil\n- \u00b7  Achieved our goal of 100% water reuse in Mau\u00e1, Brazil, where we installed a water treatment plant in 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spectacular aircraft takes fl ight\n\nPutting our Coral decorative paints logo on a plane might seem strange, but it was a creative way for us to highlight the fact that our products feature more technology than people may realize. It also helped us to stand out by letting customers know that as well as providing advanced solutions for planes, we also help to color and protect their homes.\n\nThe project in question involved creating South America's most colorful airplane. Our Coral brand partnered with Aerospace Coatings colleagues to work with Azul Airlines and Embraer to pay tribute to the Spix's macaw, a national symbol in Brazil. The design features 58 colors, half of which were custom made. The Embraer paint team in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos then applied our Aerodur 3001/3002 basecoat clearcoat system.\n\nDecorative Paints supported the project with a 'Let's Colour' initiative to restore a local church and theater in Cura\u00e7\u00e1 city. More than 3,000 liters of Coral paint were used.",

It aims to reduce costs, enhance effi ciency and transform the way of working across the organization.\n\nPhase 1 was completed in 2020 and, following its success, Phase 2 started in 2021 and will continue through to 2023.\n\n## Effective roll-out\n\nDuring the program's initiation, all the processes across our business units (BUs) and functions were reviewed and harmonized, while a level of standardization and centralization was also defi ned. To help ensure an effective roll-out, we appointed Global Process Owners (GPOs) for the specifi c process areas to oversee standardization and optimization.\n\nThe PRISM program formally started being introduced in 2018. It replaced the fragmented and BU-oriented application landscape with a single business platform. It's set up on a multi-region basis, which\n\n28\n\ninvolves projects being rolled out and implemented in parallel. The virtual program operates in several regions with a 200-strong team.\n\nThe methodology from previous ERP implementations and acquisitions is further enhanced and industrialized and is a key asset in rolling out the process standardization. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the roll-outs have continued in a remote way.\n\nFollowing the completion of Phase 1, more than 85% of total revenue runs on SAP driven platforms, and 65% of revenue is covered by one single SAP platform, powered by HANA technology. The further consolidation of platforms into one single SAP platform enables us to standardize, integrate and harmonize processes and deliver additional digital initiatives, consistent customer interactions and a truly integrated supply chain.\n\nPhase 2 started in China, with further roll-outs planned in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas.

This included agile talent redeployment across businesses, rollout of our 'Grow to lead' talent program and succession planning at top levels of the company. Overall employee turnover in 2020 was 13% (2019: 14%); voluntary turnover was 5% (2019: 7%). As we continued our transformation journey, we also saw the impact of uncertainty caused by COVID-19, especially in lower voluntary turnover.\n\n## Capability building to drive our 2020 ambitions\n\nTo support our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered several educational resources around mental health, resilience and social and emotional skills. We also accelerated our ambition to futureproof all learning solutions by redesigning our classroom-based learning to include digital versions, as well as ensuring our internal trainers are skilled in virtual delivery.\n\nWe continue to deploy our Leadership Essentials program across the company to provide people managers with the\n\nright tools to build a high-performing culture within their teams.\n\n## Strong progress on diversity and inclusion\n\nWe're developing an increasingly engaged, diverse and capable workforce, with a focus on ensuring management teams refl ect the diversity of our employees. We made signifi cant progress in 2020 on our key diversity and inclusion (D&I) commitments. We completed the roll-out of our online D&I training curriculum - designed to increase awareness around unconscious bias in the workplace - and launched the 'I Belong' inclusive leadership guide to help people managers lead in an inclusive way. We also introduced monthly D&I broadcasts covering gender diversity, race and ethnicity, people with diverse abilities and LGBTI+ inclusion.\n\nWe don't tolerate discrimination in any form, including racism. In 2020, events in the US and around the world stimulated even more self-refl ection from our side. We have held - and will continue to hold - people accountable. Taking a stand is a beginning, but we know it will require ongoing attention and dedication.\n\nOur global Women Inspired Network has grown signifi cantly since its launch in early 2020, with various local chapters being established. Meanwhile, our True Colors network - focused on leading inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex colleagues - continued to grow. We signed the Declaration of Amsterdam and also participated in the Workplace Pride Benchmark - in which we were recognized for notable performance in awareness and engagement.\n\nThe launch of our program to strengthen the senior female leadership pipeline - an area where we're still facing challenges to deliver meaningful improvements - was a substantial part of our commitment to increase the percentage of female leaders to 30% by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2025. We introduced a D&I scorecard and action plan for all our business units and functional management teams, and launched different development options for women with leadership potential. We also collaborated with the European Round Table (ERT), having submitted a case study around Increasing Female Representation at Senior Executive levels. This was part of their #EmbraceDifference pledge, signed by our Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Nils Smedegaard Andersen. Our close link with the ERT opened up discussions around race and ethnicity in the workplace and we proactively took a stand, incorporating it in our D&I focus for 2021.\n\n## Change management key to a healthy organization\n\nOur ambitious Winning together: 15 by 20 transformation was successfully realized by the end of the year, with some projects set to continue during 2021. We're now preparing to embark on a new journey to support our Grow & Deliver strategy. The right balance between performance and organizational health will be an instrumental part of that journey to ensure that our transformation has a lasting impact.

This resulted in an organizational health score (OHI) of 69 (2019: 61), taking the overall company score to the second quartile. In total, 87% of employees indicated they really care about the company, with 86% willing to go beyond what's normally expected to help AkzoNobel be successful. Based on insights from 2019's survey, we developed a program\n\nDuring the year, our CEO, Thierry Vanlancker, signed the Declaration of Amsterdam. Organized by Workplace Pride, signing the declaration is a visible and very positive way to show our support for LGBTI+ inclusion.\n\nfor leadership teams to support their transformation journey in making us a high-performing organization. Due to COVID-19, we made a signifi cant part of this program virtual to make it easier to manage teams at a distance. Along with various initiatives, this led to an overall top decile OHI score for the executive group. The OHI scores for our middle management, individual contributors and frontline personnel also improved signifi cantly. However, the gap between these groups and the very high scoring executive population increased. We'll address this in our future planning.\n\nAs our journey continues, we've updated our behaviors to better refl ect and support our Grow & Deliver strategy and company purpose. An implementation plan is in place, providing a toolkit for managers. We'll evaluate the adoption rate and progress at the end of 2021.\n\nNote 2\n\n## Health and safety\n\n## Our vision is to achieve zero injuries and harm through operational excellence.\n\nAs one of our core values, health and safety underpins our tireless commitment to creating a safe workplace and delivering leading safety performance.\n\nWe do this by consistently applying leading programs and processes in the areas of people, product and process safety. We report, analyze and learn from all our health and safety incidents to continuously improve our safety performance.\n\nIn order to deliver leading and sustainable performance and strengthen our commitment-based safety culture, we also invest in visible safety leadership and employee engagement initiatives.\n\nOur strategic Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE&S) priorities are focused on driving:\n\n- \u00b7  Continuous improvement of standardized HSE&S processes to achieve leading maturity levels\n- \u00b7  The implementation of an integrated HSE&S management system\n- \u00b7  A commitment-based HSE&S culture embedding operational excellence to achieve our vision of zero injuries and harm\n\nOur leading HSE&S management system drives continuous improvement through operational excellence in all aspects of HSE&S. This includes company-wide standards, regular performance reviews, systematic data analysis, root cause analyses of incidents, training, self-assessments, annual improvement planning, independent internal audit and on-time action closure. It also incorporates promoting learning a cross the organization, including best practice sharing. Our corporate HSE&S management system is\n\nglobally certifi ed to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards, with ongoing transfer to ISO 45001.\n\nCompliance assurance is one of our key HSE&S priorities. It's particularly relevant to ensuring our license to operate and our business continuity, considering the fast-changing regulatory environment we operate in. We take a proactive approach to implementing any necessary changes, from both a risk mitigation and advocacy perspective.\n\nIn 2020, we confi gured and implemented a company-wide digital compliance assurance process. It includes a regulatory monitoring and alert system, along with a self-assessment tool which ensures we're compliant with existing regulatory frameworks and up-todate with the latest changes, as well as enabling proactive response to new requirements.\n\n## Responding to COVID-19\n\nWhen COVID-19 fi rst surfaced in China, we activated our North Asia regional crisis management, supported by the global organization, Integrated Supply Chain and the functional teams. As the pandemic began to spread worldwide, we set up a global crisis management team, as well as regional crisis teams.\n\nCOVID-19 guidance and requirements regarding employee health and safety - including emergency escalation and response plans - were developed and deployed globally. Strong cross-functional and global/regional collaboration and alignment enabled successful management of our response to the pandemic. Our global COVID-19 health and safety guidelines included:\n\n- \u00b7  Workplace guidelines\n- \u00b7  Guidelines for commercial teams, including customer visits\n- \u00b7  Safe work from home\n- \u00b7  SAQ (self-assessment questionnaire)\n- \u00b7  Behavior-based safety (BBS) 'adapted' to COVID-19\n- \u00b7  Travel guidance",

Despite COVID-19, the complete 2020 audit plan was performed, with most of the 28 audits being carried out remotely due to travel restrictions.\n\n## People safety\n\nIn 2020, the total reportable rate (TRR) improved to 0.23 (2019: 0.24), slightly above the target level set for 2020 (0.20). In total, 81% of our locations and 72% of our manufacturing sites have been reportable injury-free for over a year. The most frequent causes of reportable injuries are 'slips, trips and falls', 'struck by or caught in-between objects' and 'manual handling'. The most frequent injuries are strains/sprains, cuts/ lacerations and fractures.\n\nAlthough the TRR decreased, the severity of injuries increased slightly. This is refl ected in the lost time injury rate for employees including temporary workers (LTIR), which was 0.09 (2019: 0.08). Although safety is paramount within our company, a signifi cant safety incident occurred in Felling, UK, which triggered actions to further drive continuous improvement towards operational excellence.\n\nTo help us achieve year-on-year improvement in safety performance, we've introduced a number of focused programs, in addition to our yearly HSE&S Common Platform program:\n\n- \u00b7  Top three injuries safety program, which has driven a 30% and 45% injury reduction\n- \u00b7  HSE&S dedicated country networks in the four countries that contributed 44% of the total reportable injuries (TRI) - achieved a 47% reduction in TRI compared with 2019\n- \u00b7  Implementation of global and site specifi c leading performance indicators, moving the focus from lagging to leading KPIs. This has been critical in further driving visible leadership and employee involvement, leading to proactive injury prevention\n- and a stronger commitment-based safety culture\n- \u00b7  Reinforcement of our 'Learning from incidents' program to include early warning alerts\n- \u00b7  Tracking on-time action closure for critical HSE&S actions (as part of leading KPIs)\n- \u00b7  Safe driver program, with a focus on those using two and four wheels\n- \u00b7  Redesign of the self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) - which assesses the maturity of HSE&S program implementation and specifi c requirements at sites - and a review of the framework for our global audit program. We've also invested in developing visible safety leadership and employee engagement initiatives\n\nThe number of contractor reportable injuries was slightly lower in 2020, resulting in a reportable injury rate of 0.17 (2019: 0.19). The contractors lost time injury rate increased to 0.11 (2019: 0.09).\n\nAnalysis revealed that inadequate/poor adherence to procedures were the main cause of contractor incidents. To help counter this trend, a contractor safety procedure and self-assessment process were introduced to target the quality of (and adherence to) key procedures, with benefi ts for our own employees, as well as contractors.\n\n## Process safety\n\nThe number of losses of primary containment (LOPC incidents) decreased in 2020. However, based on an analysis of the 2020 process safety events, and considering the nature of the processes and materials we use, we initiated a dedicated Process Safety Management (PSM) improvement project, designed to strengthen our PSM program and processes to achieve leading standards in process safety.\n\n## Health\n\nWe continue to actively manage occupational illness-related absenteeism, as part of our commitment to\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## Total reportable injury rate employees/ temporary workers\n\nThe total reportable injury rate (TRR) is the number of injuries resulting in a medical treatment case, restricted work case, lost time case or fatality, per 200,000 hours worked.

As well as simply being the right thing to do, supporting people and communities and building employee pride also strengthens our reputation. It's delivering shared value for everyone.\n\nDue to the global pandemic, during 2020 we shifted our attention to support local communities with their urgent needs (see Business as unusual on page 10).\n\nOur biggest community projects took place in India, Brazil and the UK. We distributed critical items such as food, hygiene kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) to various communities in need. For example, during lockdown\n\nin India, our employees distributed dry food kits to daily wage laborers and PPE to health workers and the frontline police force. Meanwhile, colleagues in the UK focused in particular on supporting the needs of the elderly and vulnerable, providing help for homeless shelters, foodbanks, hospices and children's wellbeing groups.\n\nIt's ten years since we fi rst launched our global 'Let's Colour' program and we continue to transform lives by revitalizing communities and making spaces more liveable and inspiring. Projects that took place during 2020 saw us use more than 260,000 liters of paint to color communities in 27 countries including Recife in Brazil and Bandung in Indonesia - while we also renovated an SOS Children's Villages kindergarten in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n\nTo strengthen our focus on training future generations, we extended our partnership with SOS Children's Villages for another three years.

We've conducted due diligence and issued company-wide standards for working hours, which are being implemented throughout the organization. We've also conducted due diligence on the compensation we offer our employees versus international living wage standards for the ten high risk countries. The initial results show that while we comply with legal requirements, there are certain gaps between our compensation and international living wage standards that merit further due diligence.

We have clear rules and apply strict consequence management in case of violation of these rules. In 2019, we launched a global training program for all our employees on diversity and unconscious bias. In 2020, this roll-out continued. The e-learnings that are part of this program had a completion rate of 78% of all online employees (including contractors) in 2020. For offline employees, the roll-out of faceto-face workshops was unfortunately paused due to the pandemic.\n\n## 4  Modern slavery\n\nWe have zero tolerance for modern slavery, such as child labor or forced labor, and conduct relevant due diligence into our supply chain. We identified cobalt, mica minerals and tin as raw materials possibly impacting human rights in our supply chain - in particular regarding health and safety, working conditions and modern slavery. These materials are used in the manufacture of some\n\nWe're proud to have extended our partnership with Plan International Nederland for another year. With our support, young people growing up in challenging circumstances can bridge the gap between overcoming the daily struggles they face and being able to realize their dreams.\n\nadditives, pigments, resins and tin packaging material we source. In the case of mica minerals, we continued to collaborate with suppliers to track their entire supply chain back to the mines of origin and monitored their value chain to ensure a responsible and sustainable mica supply chain. For cobalt and tin, we surveyed all 120 identified suppliers, using templates from the Responsible Minerals Initiative. Of those suppliers who confirmed using high risk materials necessary to the functionality of the product, 81% disclosed their smelters. In total, 57% of these smelters are either listed as active or conformant smelters in the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). Suppliers with a 'conflict free statement', but who didn't disclose the smelters in their supply chain, have not been included in this percentage, since our due diligence is based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains. See our website for more on conflict minerals: akzonobel.com/en/about-us/ position-statements/conflict-minerals\n\n## Reprioritizing salient human rights issues\n\nCOVID-19 had a major social impact across the globe. See page 10 for an overview of how our efforts to address the social effects of the pandemic were carried out in a responsible manner.\n\nThe virus has introduced a new reality and potentially additional human rights risks that we need to address across our value chain. As a result, and in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles to continuously assess a company's salient human rights issues, we have reassessed our current internal salient human rights issues this year. Multiple interviews, workshops and data analysis have been carried out to understand the current human rights risks from an internal perspective. We concluded that our salient human rights issues have remained the same, but we gained insight into which part(s) of the value chain the highest risks occur and should have our first focus. In the first quarter of 2021, we'll validate our findings with external stakeholders and finalize our assessment of salient human rights issues from 2021 onwards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As we work towards zero waste, we aim to reach zero non-reusable waste and have 100% of our most water intensive sites reusing water.\n\nFor many years, we've been working to operate in a more sustainable\n\n## Climate\n\nAs recommended by the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we continue to monitor our risks and opportunities related to climate change. As a company, we're exposed to physical risks - such as those associated with water scarcity and flooding - and transitional risks. These risks are linked to society's response to climate change and can lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations.\n\nFor the last five years, we've implemented an internal carbon price for investment decisions, making our future operations climate adapted, while anticipating the impact of any future carbon pricing. Despite the risks, climate change also presents business\n\nway, and we continue to take steps to reduce our environmental impact. We're focusing in particular on reducing energy use, carbon and VOC emissions, waste generation and water intake, while increasing our use of renewable electricity and materials, and water reuse.\n\nOur ambitions are tangible, and will enable us to continue making an important contribution to addressing the sustainability challenges faced by our company, customers and broader society.\n\nWe have programs in place and have identified projects that will contribute to achieving our ambitions. These include our Resource Productivity program,\n\nopportunities with potential to further strengthen our position.\n\nOur sustainable solutions (see Note 8) can help our customers to reduce carbon emissions and open up business opportunities. For example, we supply the construction industry - responsible for around 39% of global energyrelated carbon emissions - with Cool chemistry technology, which combats the urban heat island effect, meaning less energy is needed for cooling.\n\nMore than 98% of the carbon emissions in our value chain come from our suppliers and the use of our products by customers. In 2020, we further improved the methodology for determining our Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions by better incorporating the formulation\n\nof our raw materials into the calculations. More about the methodology can be found in Managing sustainability on page 50. Based on the new methodology, the overall cradle-to-grave carbon footprint was 7% lower than 2019, partly the result of volume and product mix impact due to COVID-19.\n\nMeanwhile, our 'Planet' ambitions demonstrate our strong climate mitigation plans. We also implement circular principles to prepare our operations for the future while reducing costs.\n\nThe importance of water management is recognized across our supply chain. We've taken a significant step towards water stewardship by endorsing the UN's CEO Water Mandate and setting\n\nwhich is the main contributor to our current environmental performance and the key enabler for delivering on our ambitions.\n\nCurrently, we have more than 500 projects underway at both global and local level which are helping to reduce carbon emissions, VOC, waste and water use. Progress is monitored on a monthly basis, focusing on environmental impact and financial benefits. During 2020, we saved more than \u20ac9 million from projects directly related to waste, energy reduction and water reuse.\n\nclear goals on water reuse (see Note 6). In 2020, we assessed the water-related risks at our manufacturing sites by using the Aqueduct tool and the WWF Water risk filter, supplied by the World Resource Institute. The results will help us develop water risk management plans accordingly.\n\nWe've also included a water risk analysis as part of our Supplier Sustainability Balanced Scorecard. In 2020, we analyzed around 200 of our suppliers' locations using the Aqueduct tool, assessing both water scarcity and flood risks. We ask suppliers with high risk to share their mitigation plans and, at the same time, are working with them to look for solutions to these challenges.",

Compared with the 2018 baseline, we have achieved a reduction of 19%.\n\nOne of the key contributing factors to reducing carbon emissions is to lower energy consumption - we're aiming to cut our energy use by 30% by 2030. As well as improving the energy effi ciency of equipment and installations - including LED and compressed air systems - we're also putting a strong focus on behavior, such as monitoring leading to actions.\n\nDespite the reduction in volumes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we're close to our yearly energy reduction target (3%), with an overall reduction in energy consumption of 2.7% (relative) in 2020.\n\nThe second contributing factor to halving our carbon emissions is converting to 100% renewable electricity. We're therefore installing solar panels at a number of our locations and are actively looking to source renewable electricity. Currently, our total share of renewable electricity use is 40%, with 34 of our locations and 12 countries already using 100% renewable electricity.\n\nBy the end of 2020, 17 sites had solar panels as their own renewable electricity source. We're aiming to increase this number signifi cantly in the near future as part of a global program. We're aware that the electricity generated by these solar panels will not be enough to cover our total electricity consumption needs, so we'll also continue to purchase renewable electricity with certifi cates of origin.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions made up of direct emissions from processes and combustion at our facilities and indirect emissions from purchased energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorthern Illinois Foodbank was a recipient of our COVID-19 Matching Gifts program.

We focus on reducing waste generation in our manufacturing processes as part of our resource productivity program. We're also committed to reusing and recycling obsolete materials and continue to promote a circular economy.\n\nTo help increase our contribution to the circular economy, new outlets have been identifi ed for materials that would otherwise have been disposed of as waste. This has resulted in a waste avoidance of 8,500 tons.\n\nIn total, our reusable waste in 2020 was 32 kilotons, with 58% of our obsolete materials being reused, enabling us to further contribute to the circular economy.\n\nDuring 2020, despite the volumes variation due to COVID-19, we reduced relative waste (kg/ton material produced) by 5%, achieving our 2020 goal. Most of our locations contributed through various programs introduced worldwide. Examples of some of our waste reduction projects include the installation of solvent recovery units; reducing packaging waste by moving from smaller paper bags or metal drums to bulk deliveries of raw materials; and reworking obsolete fi nished goods.\n\n## Water\n\nSustainable water supply is essential to our business. We rely on water for, among others, raw material production, product formulation and manufacturing, cooling, cleaning and transportation.\n\nA signifi cant number of our water intensive sites already reuse water.By focusing more and introducing the necessary technology, we'll not only reduce our overall water intake and wastewater discharge, we'll also be able to recover and reuse materials present in the process water, resulting in improved material effi ciency and less waste.\n\nOur most water intensive locations are often waterbased paint production sites, where water is used",

To meet our expectations, suppliers have to reach an EcoVadis total assessment score of 45 and a labor and human rights sub-scheme score of 50. Together with EcoVadis, we organized online trainings to help suppliers improve, with 107 attending across all regions.\n\nMost of our developmental suppliers are small or medium sized companies based in risk regions. They typically require multiple assessments to reach the target score. Suppliers who are in line with expectations must also renew their assessment at least every three years, which explains why continuous improvements can only be achieved in gradual steps.\n\nTo complement the EcoVadis online assessment, we continue to carry out TfS audits on suppliers located in risk regions. In 2020, we optimized the TfS audit program and set up a dedicated cross-regional team to monitor the progress of corrective actions. This enabled us to close more than 60% of the previous year's major audit fi ndings at our suppliers.\n\nMain areas for improvement from the 2019 audits include emergency preparedness, process safety and\n\nstorage, and occupational health and safety.

The new process\n\nuses bio-based monomers\n\nto make resins, which are\n\ntraditionally oil-based.\n\nRequiring just UV light, oxygen\n\nand renewable raw materials,\n\npatent applications have already\n\nbeen fi led for resins and coatings\n\nmade with monomers derived\n\nfrom sugar derivatives isolated\n\nfrom biomass.\n\n'There's no doubt we're on the verge of\n\nprogressing to the next level of coatings\n\ntechnology, thanks to this fantastic\n\nexample of collaborative innovation\n\nin action,' explains Klaas Kruithof,\n\nAkzoNobel's Chief Technology Offi cer.\n\n'We're opening up a new future for\n\npaints and coatings by using sustainable\n\nbuilding blocks that will enable us to\n\nexplore and develop some really exciting\n\nfunctionalities for our customers.'\n\nMost of the research has been taking\n\nplace at the University of Groningen\n\nA coating from nature\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- where the team is led by professor\n\nin organic chemistry and Nobel Prize\n\nwinner, Ben Feringa, and PhD student,\n\nGeorge Hermens. 'I'm extremely\n\npleased with these game-changing\n\nresults,' says Feringa (pictured right).\n\n'They show that a material for coatings\n\ncan be produced from biomass using a\n\nsustainable chemical process.'\n\nHaving started in 2018, the research\n\nproject will now focus on optimizing the\n\nmonomers so they can be made in a\n\nmore effi cient way and on a larger\n\nscale. 'We've still got a long way to\n\ngo in terms of exploring the scope of\n\nthe technology, but it will almost certainly\n\ndefi ne the future of our products,'\n\ncontinues Kruithof. 'By 2040 or 2050,\n\nthere's also a good chance we might\n\nonly be using bio-based monomers in\n\nour resin production, which will help us\n\nto reduce the overall carbon footprint of\n\nour products.'\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nCASE STUDY\n\nAligned with SDG\n\n12, 13 and 17\n\n(see page 30).\n\nAkzoNobel Report 2020  |  Sustainability statements\n\n49\n\n49",

Given our focus on sustainability, overall ownership of sustainability is with the CEO.\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nWe use the principle of materiality to review strategic priorities and determine the most relevant and important sustainability topics material to our\n\n## Materiality matrix\n\nPeople\n\nPlanet\n\nPaint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImportance for AkzoNobel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompany. We focus on topics with the biggest impact in terms of accelerating our strategy and their importance for stakeholder decisionmaking. We review the topics based on input from internal and external stakeholders. The materiality assessment is based on key risks and opportunities, as they relate to the acceleration of our business agenda and approach to sustainable business. The key topics identified are validated annually and assessed on relative importance.\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nWe use our internally developed reporting principles to make our reporting more precise and better aligned with our business and operations. They are aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The complete reporting principles are on our website, along with an index of the GRI indicators.\n\n## Topic\n\n## Report 2020\n\nCompared with 2019, the only significant change in our reporting methodology is in Scope 3 upstream and downstream.\n\nThe preparation of our Sustainability statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. In general, Scope 3 upstream and downstream and eco-premium solutions have a higher degree of judgment and complexity, for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in different results than those recorded.\n\nThe main and most important elements of these are highlighted below.

They were a visible expression of the Royal Mail's support for all NHS staff who worked tirelessly to help those affected by COVID-19. The postboxes, coated in 'NHS blue', were located close to a handful of hospitals in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\non amount of power and heat (natural gas), typical VOC levels and percentage of VOCs incinerated.\n\n## Eco-premium solutions\n\nA measure of the sustainability of our products compared with competitive products, which have customer/ con sumer benefits, as a percentage of our actual revenue over the period November 1, 2019, to October 31, 2020. For Powder Coatings, segment growth to previous year revenue is applied.\n\nAn eco-premium solution is significantly better than competing offers in the market in at least one eco-efficiency criterion (toxicity, energy use, use of natural resources/raw materials, emissions and waste, land use, risks, health and well-being), and not significantly worse in any other. In determining the KPI, AkzoNobel product groups are reviewed against a mainstream product in the market which delivers the same function. This can be an AkzoNobel or competitor offering. The assessments are performed to the best of our abilities by internal experts, based on either quantitative or qualitative aspects, of which the latter is subject to inherent subjective considerations.",

However, there were still several highlights, including the launch of the new AkzoNobel Art Foundation catalog - We Are the Collection.\n\nThe magazine-style publication sheds light on the identity of the titular 'We' and features contributions by artists, curators, photographers, art critics, writers and AkzoNobel colleagues.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the catalog, AkzoNobel's Executive Committee member Isabelle Deschamps (pictured above) commented: 'A corporate art collection is an act of commitment towards the societies and communities in which we live and operate. A commitment AkzoNobel has kept for the past 25 years. Now that is\n\n54\n\nsomething to be proud of. Art is about being inclusive and being ready to be inspired, but also challenged. Art is pioneering, it's about pushing boundaries.'\n\nA jubilee exhibition which was due to open in 2020 was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been rescheduled to open in September 2021 at the AkzoNobel Art Space in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nIt was also a great honor and privilege to see the Art Foundation's unceasing support for the international art world over the last 25 years recognized by His Majesty King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, who appointed Hester Alberdingk Thijm (pictured below) - Director of the AkzoNobel Art Foundation - as a Knight in the Order of Oranje-Nassau.",

Consequently, a broad range of processes and procedures has been implemented, designed to provide control by the Board of Management over the company's operations.\n\nThese processes and procedures include measures regarding the general control environment, such as a Code of Conduct, policies and procedures and authority rules, as well as specific measures, such as a risk management system, a system of controls and a system of letters of financial representation by responsible management at various levels within our company.\n\n## STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nAll these processes and procedures are aimed at providing a reasonable level of assurance that we have identified and managed the significant risks of our company, and that we meet our operational and financial objectives in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For a detailed description of the company's internal risk management, please refer to the Risk management section.\n\nWith respect to supporting and monitoring of compliance with laws and regulations - including our Code of Conduct - an Integrity and Compliance Committee has been established. The Compliance function makes rules available through the Policy Portal, manages the online and face-to-face compliance training program, provides legal expert support and manages investigations related to our SpeakUp! corporate complaints procedure.\n\nThe Internal Control function maintains AkzoNobel's Internal Control Framework, monitors the compliance and includes updates regarding the emergence of new risks. They support the annual review of the effectiveness of the system of governance, risk management and internal controls of the Board of Management. Internal Audit provides comfort to the Board of Management, as well as the Supervisory Board, that our system of risk management and internal controls - as designed and represented by management - are adequate and effective.\n\nWhile we routinely work towards continuous improvement of our processes and procedures regarding financial reporting, the Board of Management is of the opinion that:\n\n- \u00b7  The report provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems\n- \u00b7  These systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain material inaccuracies\n- \u00b7  Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis\n- \u00b7  The report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of the company's continuity for the period of 12 months after report preparation\n\nFor a detailed description of the risk management system and the principal risks identified, reference is made to the Risk management and Integrity and compliance management chapters in this section.\n\nWe have discussed the above opinion and conclusions with the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the external auditor.\n\nAmsterdam, February 16, 2021\n\n## The Board of Management\n\nThierry Vanlancker, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Management Maarten de Vries, CFO and member of the Board of Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information please visit our website: www.akzonobel.com/en/about-us/governance-/ board-of-management-and-executive-committee",

        "page_content": "2020 was a diffi cult year for the whole world due to the global pandemic, although it turned into a good year for AkzoNobel.\n\nWith COVID-19 impacting the company's revenue, Decorative Paints delivered a very strong performance, while Performance Coatings experienced more headwinds, especially during the fi rst half of the year. Profi tability increased further as a result of signifi cant efforts to reduce costs, improve product mix and margins, as well as strengthen and standardize the company's processes and systems.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has been impressed by the way AkzoNobel responded to the unprecedented challenges posed during the year and how the organization was able to generate positive momentum and deliver on its Winning together: 15 by 20 ambition, despite facing considerable hurdles due to the pandemic. As well as ensuring the safety and well-being of employees, the company continued to serve and support its customers around the world, while at the same time creating a stronger foundation for the future. It was a clear sign of AkzoNobel's resilience and ability to adapt.\n\nMany employees had to change their ways of working - relying heavily on technology to stay connected which worked surprisingly well. The sudden increase in demand for decorative paints, and declines in several other segments, put signifi cant pressure on the fl exibility of the company's supply chain and employees had to put in extra effort to cope. So it was encouraging to see everyone's pride in the organization as AkzoNobel rose to the challenge and took signifi cant strides forward.\n\nThrough it all, the organization held fi rm on its core values, focusing on safety, acting with integrity and further improving sustainability. Extra special efforts were also made to support local communities in dealing with the global pandemic. The company's People. Planet. Paint. approach to sustainable business will ensure that AkzoNobel continues to lead the way when it comes to environmental and social impact. The success and further expansion of the Paint the Future innovation ecosystem also caught the eye of many in the industry and beyond.\n\nDuring a diffi cult year for us all, it was especially pleasing to see employee engagement improve. This remains a key focus area, with a clear ambition to become top quartile.\n\nThroughout much of 2020, many colleagues and key stakeholders were involved in uncovering a new purpose statement. The successful outcome - Pioneering a world of possibilities to bring surfaces to life - will help to further build engagement and drive the company's continued transformation.\n\nEveryone at AkzoNobel is rightfully proud to have delivered on the 15 by 20 ambition launched in 2017, closing the year with return on sales - excluding unallocated cost - of 15%, despite the challenging business environment. The changes implemented throughout the organization have been signifi cant and successful. Both the management team and employees deserve sincere compliments and thanks.\n\nHaving restored competitiveness and strengthened profi tability, AkzoNobel is now ready for the next stage of its journey, represented by the Grow & Deliver strategy. There are still multiple levers - such as increased commercial excellence and network optimization - for the company to save costs and enable increased investments in growth, paving the way for a future which can excite all stakeholders. Management has clearly shown they can balance delivering short-term results with achieving long-term sustainability. This ability to address today's challenges while driving the changes necessary to thrive tomorrow will prove vital and the Supervisory Board is looking forward to the next chapter.\n\nI want to thank my Supervisory Board colleagues, the Board of Management and Executive Committee for all their efforts during an extraordinary year, when nearly all our contact took place by video calls. The frequency of meetings was high throughout the year, which allowed the Supervisory Board to be closely involved, including in the development of plans for the future.\n\nMost importantly, I want to thank AkzoNobel's employees around the world for their continued passion and commitment, which helped to deliver an exceptional result during an unprecedented year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmsterdam, February 16, 2021\n\nNils Smedegaard Andersen\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNils\n\nSmedegaard Andersen\n\n(1958, DK) Chairman\n\nInitial appointment: 2018\n\nTerm of offi ce:\n\n2018-2022\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors of Unilever plc.; Former non-executive Director of BP plc.; Former CEO of A.P.

If Supervisory Board members are unable to attend a Supervisory Board or committee meeting, they inform the relevant chair of their reasons. Supervisory Board members always receive the materials for each specific meeting, allowing them to offer input and discuss any agenda items with the relevant chair and provide a proxy to act on their behalf. In 2020, the Board of Management attended all regular and all additional meetings. The Executive Committee attended the majority of the meetings. Almost all plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board were preceded or succeeded by executive sessions of the Supervisory Board, with or without the CEO in attendance. The Chairman had regular one-on-one calls with all Supervisory Board members to discuss individual impressions on the functioning of the Supervisory Board and items covered.\n\nThe Supervisory Board aims for all (regular) meetings to be held physically. However, during 2020, most meetings were held virtually due to COVID-19 related measures.

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board was also involved in uncovering the new company purpose and developing the simplified leadership behavior framework.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe Supervisory Board held additional meetings to discuss regular updates on the COVID-19 situation from a global pandemic response team. The team, which was led by the Executive Committee, consisted of various workstreams and regional response teams, with any key risks being identified. The Supervisory Board was regularly informed about the health of AkzoNobel employees and reviewed the related responses from various parts of the business, the risks identified and the measures taken.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe Supervisory Board views sustainability as an intrinsic value driver in the work of all businesses and\n\nThe Supervisory Board is confident that by making sustainability an explicit differentiator - part of the company's identity AkzoNobel has enhanced its value proposition for stakeholders.\n\nfunctions. During 2020, the Supervisory Board continued to assess sustainability as part of strategy and targets. The Supervisory Board is confident that by making sustainability an explicit differentiator - part of the company's identity - AkzoNobel has enhanced its value proposition for stakeholders, including employees and business partners. Further details are included in the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Performance and management planning\n\nIndividual Board of Management and Executive Committee performance was addressed in Supervisory Board meetings, following recommendations from the Remuneration Committee. For more details, see the report of the Remuneration Committee on page 64.\n\nDiscussions on corporate performance were held at each regular Supervisory Board meeting and included business reviews and performance updates from corporate functions. Forwardlooking targets were also addressed in light of these reviews, and both the proposed budget and operating plan for 2021 were diligently reviewed by the Supervisory Board in Q4, taking into account the COVID-19 situation and other prevailing market conditions. Following this assessment, the Supervisory Board has approved the proposed budget and operating plan for 2021.\n\nDuring the year, the Supervisory Board was pleased to see the company continuing to benefit from management's strategic initiatives, including cost savings. The nature of this performance, the company's capital allocation priorities - as well as the significant market disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic - were all considered in the Supervisory Board's approval of the dividend proposal (further details on the 2020 dividend proposal can be found on page 131, in the Profit allocation paragraph).\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Supervisory Board views risk management as an essential mechanism to safeguard the business and assets of the company, and to secure long-term performance and value creation. As the Supervisory Board sought to assure itself of the robustness of the company's risk mitigation and internal controls, it received multiple risk management updates during the year.\n\nThe Board of Management and Executive Committee maintain the risk management framework and system of internal controls. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee monitor the implementation of risk mitigating measures for the key risks, as identified by the Board of Management and the Executive Committee during the year by means of risk updates and reviews. Further details are included in the Risk management chapter.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Supervisory Board continuously reviews the company's corporate governance and its compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Talent management and succession planning\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board, after discussing its own composition and succession plans, proposed the reappointment of Dr. Pamela Kirby as member of the Supervisory Board. The reappointment was approved at the AGM held on April 23, 2020. Following the retirement of Ben Verwaayen as member of the Supervisory Board in April 2020, the number of members of the Supervisory Board was reduced to eight as of April 23, 2020.\n\nDuring 2020, the Supervisory Board also discussed and supported changes to the composition of the Executive Committee. With Ruud Joosten stepping down as Chief Operating Officer, his responsibilities were taken over by the CEO ad interim.\n\nMarten Booisma was succeeded as Chief Human Resources Officer by Jo\u00eblle Boxus as of March 9, 2020. The requirements of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the skills matrix, updated further upon recommendation by the Nomination Committee, were considered throughout the process.",

        "page_content": "## Independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board members are required to act critically and independently of one another, the Board of Management, the Executive Committee and the company's stakeholders. Each member of the Supervisory Board meets the independence requirements of the Code and completed the annual independence questionnaire addressing the relevant requirements for independence.\n\n## Supervisory Board evaluation\n\nTo assess its effectiveness, the Supervisory Board carried out an independent performance evaluation - facilitated by a third party - of itself, its individual members, its Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the Chairman, as well as the relationship with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The process consisted of Supervisory Board members completing a confidential questionnaire, while the third party held interviews with each of the members of the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the other members of the Executive Committee, the external auditor and the external advisor of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn a separate meeting without the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board discussed the results of the evaluation questionnaires. The Supervisory Board also discussed the functioning of the Board of Management and the performance of its individual members.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is pleased to confirm the evaluation concluded that the Supervisory Board and its committees continue to operate proficiently. There is a dynamic and open atmosphere between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board papers reflect this openness, although it was recommended that board papers be shared in a more timely manner in the future. With regard to Supervisory Board meetings, the Chairman and CEO will work together\n\nto review the current Supervisory Board agenda to ensure both the topics and the time allocation reflect the future strategic priorities for the company. In line with AkzoNobel embarking on its new Grow & Deliver strategy, the key recommendations included reviewing the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Committees to optimize their fit for the future. In addition, the Nomination Committee will ensure a strong executive development and succession management program is developed during 2021. AkzoNobel has a strong track record in ESG and will continue to focus on this across all countries in which it operates. The Supervisory Board will continue to actively support these initiatives. The impact of COVID19 meant that most of the interaction took place virtually in 2020. As soon as restrictions allow, spending more time in person will be prioritized. In the meantime, the use of virtual technology to enable the Supervisory Board to 'meet' with AkzoNobel's people around the world and deep dive into different areas of the business has been very helpful and will continue in 2021.\n\n## Financial statements and profit allocation\n\nThe Board of Management submitted the report and financial statements, including the report of the Board of Management, to the Supervisory Board\n\nfor review and approval. The financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. for the financial year 2020 were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. (PwC).\n\nThe financial statements and the report were extensively discussed by the Audit Committee with the external auditors, in the presence of the CFO, and by the full Supervisory Board with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. Based on these discussions, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the 2020 financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.\\/. form an adequate basis to account for the supervision provided (see the financial statements). The Audit Committee monitors the follow-up by management on the recommendations made by the external auditors. The Supervisory Board recommends that the AGM adopts the financial statements as presented in this Report 2020 and, as proposed by the Board of Management, the proposed total dividend for 2020 of \u20ac1.95 (2019: \u20ac1.90), including a final dividend of \u20ac1.52 per share. An interim dividend of \u20ac0.43 (2019: \u20ac0.41) per share was paid in November 2020. This reflects the continued commitment to providing a stable to rising dividend. The dividend will be paid in cash.\n\nIn addition, it is requested that the AGM discharges the members of the Board of\n\n## Committees of the Supervisory Board\n\n|                                    | Audit   Committee   | Remuneration   Committee   | Nomination   Committee   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Nils Smedgaard Andersen (Chairman) |                     | Member                     | Chairman                 |\n| Byron Grote (Vice-Chairman)        | Chairman            |                            | Member*                  |\n| Sue Clark                          |                     | Member                     | Member**                 |\n| Michiel Jaski                      | Member              |                            |                          |\n| Dr. Pamela Kirby                   |                     | Member                     | Member                   |\n| Jolanda Poots-Bijl                 | Member              |                            |                          |\n| Dick Sluimers                      | Member*             | Chairman                   | Member                   |\n| Patrick Thomas                     | Member              |                            |                          |\n| Ben Verwaayen                      |                     | Member***                  | Member***                |\n\n- * Until February 11, 2020.\n- **  From February 11, 2020.\n- *** Until his retirement in April 2020.",

AkzoNobel has a sponsored level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program and ADRs can be traded on the international OTCQX platform in the US.\n\nThe company's management and supervision are organized under Dutch law in a so-called two-tier system, comprising a Board of Management (solely composed of executive directors) and a Supervisory Board (solely composed of non-executive directors). The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Board of Management and ensures a strong external presence in the governance of the company. The two Boards are independent of each other and are accountable to the annual meeting of shareholders (AGM) for the performance of their functions.\n\nOur corporate governance framework is based on the company's Articles of Association, the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') and all applicable laws and regulations, including securities laws. The Code contains principles and best practices for Dutch companies with listed shares. Deviations from the Code are explained\n\nin accordance with the Code's 'comply or explain' principle. For the full version of the Code, visit www.mccg.nl\n\nWith the exception of those aspects of our governance which can only be amended with the approval of the AGM, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board may make adjustments to the way the Code is applied, if this is considered to be in the best interests of the company. Where changes are made, these will be reported and explained in the annual report for the relevant year and discussed at the subsequent AGM.\n\n## BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE  COMMITTEE\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. When it comes to the management of our business, it operates in the context of an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee comprises the members of the Board of Management (currently the Chief Executive Offi cer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Offi cer (CFO)), the Chief Supply Chain Offi cer, the General Counsel and the Chief Human Resources Offi cer. The former Chief Operating Offi cer was also a member of the Executive Committee, until stepping down as of May 27, 2020.\n\nCommercial\n\nShare-\n\nholders\n\nIntegrated Supply Chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupport functions\n\nThe composition of the Executive Committee ensures that functional, operational and commercial expertise is entrenched at the highest level of the organization. Among other responsibilities, the Board of Management defi nes the company's strategic direction. It establishes and maintains internal policies and procedures for effective risk management and control, manages the realization of the company's operational and fi nancial targets, its sustainability performance and its pursuit of long-term value creation. In fulfi lling their duties, Board of Management members are assisted by the Executive Committee and guided by the interests of the company and its affi liated enterprises, taking into consideration the relevant interests of the company's stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of Management and Executive Committee promote openness and engagement through a SpeakUp! grievance mechanism and have established a Code of Conduct, policies, rules and procedures incorporated in the company's Policy framework, in order to drive a culture of good governance, consistency and functional excellence. The values of good governance, sustainability and teamwork adopted by the Board of Management are incorporated in these documents.

Since 2018, Insight surveys have been performed involving all employees, focused on our wider organizational health (see Note 1 of the Sustainability statements). The Executive Committee and Supervisory Board regularly discuss the results of the survey, the targets and the actions taken to achieve such targets.\n\nThe Board of Management takes precedence; all Executive Committee decisions require a majority of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Management can decide to reserve decisions for itself. The members of the Board of Management remain accountable for all decisions made by the Executive Committee. The Board of Management is accountable for its performance to the Supervisory Board and is accountable to the shareholders of the company at the AGM. The Executive Committee members who are not also members of the Board of Management report to the CEO.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has regular, direct interaction with all members of the Executive Committee and all Executive Committee members attend most Supervisory Board meetings.\n\nThe CEO leads the Executive Committee in its overall management of the company. He is the main point of liaison\n\nwith the Supervisory Board. The CFO is responsible for overseeing AkzoNobel's finances, its corporate control, investor relations and information management.\n\nThe tasks, responsibilities and procedures of the Board of Management and Executive Committee are set out in their Rules of Procedure. These rules have been approved by the Supervisory Board and are available on our website. Authority to represent the company is vested in the two members of the Board of Management, acting jointly. The Board of Management has also delegated a level of authority to corporate agents, including the other members of the Executive Committee. The list of authorized signatories is filed with, and available from, the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Managing Directors of the company's business units and the Corporate Directors in charge of the different functions report to individual Executive Committee members with specific responsibility for their activities and performance.\n\n## Appointment\n\nBoard of Management members are appointed and removed from office by the AGM. The current Board of Management members were appointed by EGMs (Extraordinary General Meetings) held in 2017. The other members of the Executive Committee are appointed by the CEO, after consultation with the Supervisory Board. Board of Management members are appointed for a term not exceeding four years, with the possibility of reappointment.\n\nAs described later in this section, the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares has the right to make binding nominations for the appointment of members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.

Peer voting and an executive survey are also used to determine the final placing.\n\n## of Management are (with the exception\n\nof those circumstances described later in this section) appointed on the basis of non-binding nominations by the Supervisory Board. In such cases, resolutions to appoint a member of the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management require a simple majority of the votes cast by shareholders.\n\nUnder certain conditions specified in the Articles of Association, shareholders may also be entitled to nominate Supervisory Board or Board of Management members for appointment. Such appointments require a two-thirds majority, representing at least 50% of the outstanding share capital, in order to be adopted at an AGM (or EGM).\n\n## Diversity\n\nAkzoNobel believes in the strength of diversity, and in accordance with the Code, a Diversity Policy has been adopted for the composition of the Board of Management and Executive Committee. The objective of the Diversity Policy is to enrich the Board of Management's perspective, improve performance, increase member value and enhance the probability of achievement of the company's goals and objectives. The Diversity Policy addresses concrete targets relating to diversity, including nationality, age, gender, education and work background. As part of our commitment",

AkzoNobel currently diverges from the gender target of at least 30% female and at least 30% male Board of Management members.\n\nwhich was of material significance to the company and to the relevant member.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management was lastly amended following approval by the AGM held on April 23, 2020, to implement the Shareholder Rights Directive II. The details of this policy can be found in the Remuneration report. The service contracts of the members of the Board of Management contain change of control provisions. Further details can be\n\n## AkzoNobel has a gender diversity of 40% female representatives at Executive Committee level.\n\nIt is believed that due to the size of the Board of Management (being only two members), this divergence is justified and has ensured the best candidates for the roles were nominated by the Supervisory Board and appointed by shareholders. Following the appointment of Jo\u00eblle Boxus as the new Chief Human Resources Officer (as of March 9, 2020), and the steppng down of the Chief Operating Officer (as of May 27, 2020), AkzoNobel has a gender diversity of 40% female representatives at Executive Committee level. More information on AkzoNobel's overall diversity and inclusion efforts can be found on page 33.\n\n## Outside directorships\n\nSpecific rules on outside board positions of members of the Executive Committee - which are more stringent than the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code can be found in the Rules of Procedure.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDuring 2020, no transactions were reported under which a member of the Board of Management or Executive Committee had a conflict of interest\n\nfound in the Remuneration report and Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements. The service contracts of the Board of Management are compliant with the Code. The main elements of these contracts are available on our website.\n\n## Operational Control Cycle\n\nThe Executive Committee holds regular meetings to discuss the implementation of the company's strategy and functional agendas. Additional meetings are held to discuss specific topics as required. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have delegated authorities to individual Executive Committee members and to certain committees and councils. To help plan for success and ensure alignment within the entire AkzoNobel organization on the strategic and operational plan, the Board of Management and Executive Committee implemented an Integrated Business Planning (IBP) process across the company's global businesses and functions. IBP provides, on a monthly basis, visibility on the long-term integrated business and financial plan, which covers the product portfolio, demand and supply. It therefore ensures early attention and remedial actions, where appropriate, on any potential gaps. The monthly IBP cycle ends with the Corporate Management Business Review (CMBR), which is chaired by the CEO. The Executive Committee attends the CMBR meetings, where\n\nit reviews the consolidated long-term company perspective, including risks and opportunities, decides on escalation and possible scenarios and supervises the key performance indicators with corrective actions, if applicable.\n\n## COMMITTEES\n\n## Sustainability Council\n\nThe Executive Committee has established a Sustainability Council to advise on sustainability developments. The council monitors the integration of sustainability into management processes and oversees the company's sustainability targets and sustainability performance. The council, which meets quarterly, consists of representative business and functional directors, as well as the CEO.\n\nSignificant sustainability aspects material to the company are reviewed annually, with input from internal and external\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe launched a new bio-based wall paint in Vietnam which actively improves indoor air.

The Audit Committee takes an active role in assessing the quality and reliability of sustainable performance reporting and PwC has been engaged to perform an assurance engagement on specifi c indicators included in the Sustainability statements. Their report can be found on page 138 of the Financial information.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance Committee\n\nThis committee reviews investigations into material violations of laws, regulations and internal rules, and SpeakUp! reports.

Matters proposed for consideration, approval or adoption are tabled as separate agenda items and explained in writing in advance of the meeting.\n\nThese proposals include, where relevant:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption of the financial statements\n- \u00b7  Dividend proposal\n- \u00b7  Discharge of members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management\n- \u00b7  (Re-)election of members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board\n- \u00b7  Remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board\n- \u00b7  Material changes to the Remuneration Policy of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Advisory vote on Remuneration report\n- \u00b7  Other important matters, such as major acquisitions or the sale or demerger of a substantial part of the company, as required by law\n- \u00b7  Authorization of the Board of Management to issue new shares\n- \u00b7  Authorization of the Board of Management to repurchase shares\n- \u00b7  Amendments to the Articles of Association (for more details see art. 57 of the Articles of Association available on our website)\n\nThe company provides remote voting possibilities to its shareholders. Holding shares in the company on the record date determines the right to exercise voting rights and other rights relating to the AGM. All resolutions are made on the basis of the 'one share, one vote' principle (assuming an equal par value for each class of shares). All resolutions are adopted by absolute majority, unless the law or the company's Articles of Association stipulate otherwise.\n\nHolders of common shares in aggregate representing at least 1% of the total issued capital, or, according to the Official List of Euronext Amsterdam N.V., representing a value of at least \u20ac50 million, may submit proposals for the AGM agenda. Such proposals must be adequately substantiated and submitted in writing, or electronically, to the company at least 60 calendar days in advance of the meeting. Draft minutes of the AGM are made available on the company's website within three months of the meeting date. The final minutes are made available online within six months of the meeting date.\n\n## Share classes\n\nbe found in the 'Register of substantial holdings and gross short positions' at www.afm.nl\n\nThe majority of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V. are included in a global certificate and held through the system maintained by the Dutch Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Nederland). In the past, Akzo Nobel N.V. also issued (physical) bearer share certificates (Bearer Certificates). A limited number of Bearer Certificates has not yet been surrendered to Akzo Nobel N.V., although holders of Bearer Certificates are entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V.. It is noted that, as a result of Dutch legislation which became effective as of July 2019, the relevant shares were registered in the name of Akzo Nobel N.V. by operation of law as per January 1, 2021. Pursuant to this legislation, owners of Bearer Certificates will continue to be entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V. until January 2, 2026. On that date, their entitlement will expire by operation of law.\n\n## Related information\n\nAkzoNobel has three classes\n\nFor more details about AkzoNobel shares and Bearer Certificates, contact Investor Relations:\n\ninvestor.relations@akzonobel.com\n\nThe priority shares are held by the Foundation Akzo Nobel (Stichting Akzo Nobel). The priority shares are limited in transferability and profit entitlement (see Note F of the Company financial statements). The Foundation's Board consists of members of AkzoNobel's Supervisory Board who are not members of the Audit Committee. The Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares has the nomination right for the appointment of members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as the right to approve amendments to the Articles of Association of the company.\n\nof shares: common shares, cumulative preferred shares and priority shares. Common shares are traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Common shares are also traded over-the-counter on OTCQX in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts (each American Depositary Receipt representing one-third of a common share). On December 31, 2020, a total of 190.6 million common shares and 48 priority shares had been issued. This includes shares held in treasury which cannot be voted on and which are not eligible for dividend. Shareholders owning 3% or more of the issued capital and/or voting rights must report this to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) as soon as the threshold is reached or exceeded.

Cumulative preferred shares merely have a financing function, which means if necessary, and possible, they will be issued at or near the prevailing quoted price for common shares.\n\nThe AGM held on April 23, 2020, authorized the Board of Management for a period of 18 months after that date or, if earlier, until the date on which the AGM again extends the authorization - subject to approval from the Supervisory Board - to issue shares in the capital of the company free from preemptive rights, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital. The Board of Management was also given a mandate to acquire, and to cancel held or acquired, common shares in the company's share capital. The maximum number of shares that the company will hold in its own share capital at any time shall not exceed 10% of its issued share capital.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions and control\n\nAccording to the Code, the company is required to provide an overview of its actual or potential anti-takeover measures, and to indicate in what circumstances it is expected that they may be used.\n\nThe priority shares may be considered to constitute a form of anti-takeover measure, in relation to the right of the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares to make binding nominations for appointments to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The Foundation Akzo Nobel has confirmed that it intends to make use of such rights in exceptional circumstances only. These circumstances include situations where, in the opinion of the Board of the Foundation, the continuity of the company's management and policies is at stake.\n\nThis may be the case if a public bid for the common shares of the company has been announced, or has been made, or the justified expectation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur new regional headquarters for South America was opened in Brazil. Known as the AkzoNobel House, it's a great showcase for our passion for paint.\n\nexists that such a bid will be made, without any agreement having been reached in relation to such a bid with the company. The same shall apply if one shareholder, or more shareholders acting in a concerted way, hold a substantial percentage of the issued common shares of the company without making an offer. Or if, in the opinion of the Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel, the exercise of the voting rights by one shareholder or more shareholders, acting in a concerted way, is materially in conflict with the interests of the company. In such cases, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management, in accordance with their statutory responsibility, will evaluate all available options with a view to serving the best interests of the company, its shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel has reserved the right to make use of its binding nomination rights for the appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and of the Board of Management in such circumstances. Although a deviation from provision 4.3.3 of the Code, the Supervisory Board\n\nand the Board of Management are of the opinion that these provisions will enhance the continuity of the company's management and policies.\n\nIn the event of a hostile takeover bid, or other action which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board consider adverse to the company's interests, the two Boards reserve the right to use all available powers (including the right to invoke a response time in accordance with provisions 4.1.6 and 4.1.7 of the Code), while taking into account the relevant interests of the company and its affiliate enterprises and stakeholders.\n\n## AUDITORS\n\nThe external auditor is appointed by the AGM on proposal of the Supervisory Board. The appointment is reviewed every four years and the results of this review and assessment are reported to the AGM. The external auditor attends all regular Audit Committee meetings, as well as the majority of the additional meetings, and the meeting of the",

In particular, the key audit matters are highlighted. The auditor receives the fi nancial information and underlying reports of the quarterly fi gures and can comment on and respond to this information. The external auditor is present at the AGM and shareholders may ask questions with regard to the audit.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nThe Audit Committee and Board of Management report their dealings with the external auditor to the Supervisory Board annually, and also discuss the auditor's independence.\n\n## Other services\n\nOne area of particular focus in corporate governance is the independence of the auditors. The Audit Committee has been delegated direct responsibility for the compensation and monitoring of the auditors and the services they provide to the company. Pursuant to the Audit Profession Act, the auditors are prohibited from providing the company with services in the Netherlands other than 'audit services aimed at providing reliability concerning the information supplied by the audited client for the benefi t of external users of this information and also for the benefi t of the Supervisory Board as referred to in the reports mentioned.'\n\nThe company has taken the position that no additional services may be provided by the external auditor and its global network that do not meet these requirements, unless local statutory requirements so dictate. In order to anchor this in our procedures, the Supervisory Board adopted the AkzoNobel Rules on External Auditor Independence and Selection and the related AkzoNobeI Guidelines on Auditor Independence. These documents are available on our website.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit function is mandated to provide the Board of Management, Executive Committee and Audit Committee with independent, objective assurance on the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness of the internal control framework described below. The Internal Auditor reports to the Board of Management and has direct access to the Audit Committee and its chair. The function performs its mandate based on a risk-based audit plan, which is approved by the Board of Management and the Audit Committee. It reports a summary of the audit fi ndings quarterly to the Board of Management and Executive Committee, and the Audit Committee, which culminates in an annual assessment of the quality and effectiveness of the company's internal control systems.\n\n## SHARE DEALING RULES AND RULES ON DISCLOSURE CONTROL\n\nIn accordance with Dutch Iaw and regulations (including the European Market Abuse Regulation), the company maintains insider lists and exercises controls around the dissemination and disclosure of potentially price sensitive information.\n\nAll employees and the members of the Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board are subject to the AkzoNobel Share Dealing Rules, which limit their opportunities to trade in AkzoNobel securities. Transactions in AkzoNobeI shares carried out by Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board members (including their closely associated persons) are, as and when required, notifi ed to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM).\n\nThe Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board members require authorization from the General Counsel prior to carrying\n\nout any transactions in respect of AkzoNobeI securities, even in a so-called 'open period'. In relevant cases, the General Counsel can prohibit carrying out transactions in respect of other companies' securities. In addition, all employees are subject to the AkzoNobeI Rules on Disclosure Control.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe company has strict procedures for internal controls. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have established several Risk, Control and Compliance Committees, which are explained on page 68. In 2020, we invested in enhancing our Internal Control Framework and Process, alongside the continued work on system embedded controls, standard role design and segregation of duty monitoring. An integrated Risk and Internal Control department supports all businesses and functions in their work.\n\n## Risk management\n\nOur risk management system is explained in more detail later in the next chapter.

Risk management is an essential element of our corporate governance and strategy development.

For more information on our risk management framework, visit the Risk management section on our website.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT IN 2020\n\nRisk management is a company-wide activity, under the responsibility of the Board of Management and Executive Committee, focused on the areas of major risk exposure.\n\nDuring 2020, we held a signifi cant number of enterprise risk workshops across the organization, including dedicated workshops on fraud risks in response to the rapidly changing environment due to COVID-19.

        "page_content": "We're committed to leading with integrity in our industry. It's one of our three core values. We continue to further advance and expand our Integrity and Compliance program to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations and guide our employees to make fair and honest decisions every day.\n\nBelow is a summary of the 2020 priorities and activities, and the outcomes thereof, as required pursuant to the Dutch Decree on the publication of non-financial information.\n\n## GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATION\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for maintaining a culture of integrity and ensuring an effective compliance control framework. The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees this responsibility. The Executive Committee has delegated certain responsibilities to the following committees (for more details visit our website):\n\n## Integrity and Compliance Committee\n\nReviews investigations into material violations of laws, regulations and internal rules, and SpeakUp! reports. Also decides on disciplinary measures and control improvement actions, and monitoring and responding to any trends or irregularities. By submitting these cases through a central Integrity and Compliance Committee, we ensure transparency and consistency of measures throughout the organization.\n\n## Risk, Control and Compliance Committees (RCC)\n\nResponsible for supervising the effectiveness of the control environment and reviewing weaknesses in this\n\nenvironment, as well as progress on improvement actions. There are eight Business Unit RCCs and four Functional RCCs, in addition to a Group RCC. They each met quarterly in 2020.\n\n## Human Rights Committee\n\nResponsible for supervising our Human Rights Control Framework and driving further expansion of the human rights program. To learn more, including details of how our approach to human rights helped our EcoVadis rating improve, see Note 4 of the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Privacy Committee\n\nResponsible for supervising the company's Privacy Control Framework and driving further expansion of the data privacy program. In 2020, several critical projects were delivered. These included the launch of a new tool for cookie compliance, which helps to ensure required consent is given by website visitors before cookies are used for analytics and other marketing purposes. We also introduced automated workflows for handling data subject requests to ensure they are handled in line with applicable privacy laws.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance function\n\nDay-to-day management of our Integrity and Compliance Framework is delegated to the Integrity and Compliance team, led by the Director of Integrity and Compliance, who reports to the General Counsel. The team includes legal experts in competition law; anti-bribery and anti-corruption; export control and sanctions; data privacy; and human rights.\n\nTo ensure we maintain and strengthen our culture of integrity, the Integrity and Compliance team - together with various functions and stakeholders - focuses efforts on three key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  Help leaders to lead by example\n- \u00b7  Build capabilities through training\n- \u00b7  Build awareness through communication campaigns\n\nThe Integrity and Compliance managers contribute to further strengthening the culture of integrity by identifying and ad dressing local risks and cooperating with other functions to monitor controls and follow up on SpeakUp! cases. In 2020, the heads of Integrity and Compliance, Internal Control and Internal Audit met monthly to discuss findings and actions.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nEvery year, each business unit (BU) and major function identifies its key compliance risks and defines actions to mitigate these risks. These actions form part of the BU/function integrity and compliance plan, which in turn forms part of a larger BU/function legal plan.\n\n## POLICY MANAGEMENT\n\nIn 2020, we continued to expand our Policy Portal, a one-stop-shop for key policies, rules and procedures relating to our global processes. By reducing complexity and increasing transparency, it's easier for employees to access and understand which rules apply to their job. For example, during the year we issued rules and procedures on who has authority to approve certain decisions, receiving or offering gifts, and hospitality events. We also distributed businessfriendly do's and don'ts, for example regarding parallel imports in Europe and e-commerce globally. Our policies and supporting tools increase awareness and knowledge across the company. No major risks or issues have been identified in these compliance fields.\n\n## AWARENESS AND EDUCATION\n\nIn 2020, we continued to counsel and educate employees on integrity and compliance rules and controls through e-learnings and in-person sessions. Business-friendly do's and don'ts were also issued to designated employees in specific compliance fields.",

        "page_content": "## Communication campaigns\n\nEmployees are regularly informed about compliance risks and duties. For example, in 2020, we ran campaigns to educate employees about external fraud threats, hospitality and gifts compliance and our internal reporting system. We also focus on a different aspect of integrity every month to help employees make fair and honest decisions every day. In November, a global Integrity Week was held focused on protecting company data.\n\n## E-learning\n\nEmployees are required to follow mandatory e-learnings on various subjects, including our Code of Conduct, Life-Saving Rules, operating a diverse and respectful workplace, fraud, competition law, export control, information security and data privacy.\n\n## Training sessions\n\nA number of face-to-face and virtual trainings are provided on integrity and compliance related topics. Due to the challenges posed by COVID-19, video conference trainings (including polls and Q&As) were offered to help increase employee engagement.\n\n## DUE DILIGENCE\n\nWe have processes in place to perform due diligence screenings on M&A targets and business partners. During 2020, we automated the screening of customers, suppliers and transactions in the area of export control and sanctions.\n\n## MONITORING\n\nWe have several processes to monitor compliance with our rules by employees and business partners. Managers are also required to self-assess and confirm compliance with company rules as part of the internal control self-assessment. Supplier performance is monitored through the EcoVadis self-assessment and Together for Sustainability audits. We also periodically screen high risk\n\nbusiness partners registered in the third party compliance management tool.\n\nDuring 2020, we launched our annual Code of Conduct declaration to senior leadership, with a 100% completion rate in two weeks. All our employees were then asked to reconfirm compliance.\n\nInternal Audit performs numerous audits on our operations. Their audit plan is risk-based and takes account of prior compliance and internal control findings. In 2020, several internal audits were held to validate compliance with our rules in certain units; and we advanced our Gift, Hospitality and Conflict of Interest Register for more transparency on gifts received and provided, and on potential conflicts between the company's interests and personal interests.\n\n## GRIEVANCE AND INVESTIGATION\n\nOur whistleblowing framework was named #1 out of all top companies in the Netherlands by Transparency International NL. Our SpeakUp! grievance mechanism enables employees and third parties to raise concerns about compliance with our Code of Conduct. Strict principles of confidentiality, respect for anonymity, non-retaliation, objectivity and the right to be heard are applied. A strict protocol means investigators must follow certain planning, investigation and reporting steps to ensure the right quality and speed.\n\nIn 2020, the total number of reports increased slightly, partly due to COVID19 related concerns. We continue to see higher levels of reporting through our SpeakUp! hotline and online (180 SpeakUp! vs 70 direct reporting). All reports and alerts led to 35 dismissals and various other disciplinary measures and control improvements, confirming the value of our grievance framework.\n\n## For more details, visit https://akzo.no/SpeakUp\n\n## REPORTING\n\nDuring 2020, the Director of Integrity and Compliance reported twice to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on material developments of the Integrity and Compliance Program. Should there be any material investigation matters, these are discussed with our external auditor on a quarterly basis. No individual matters or disciplinary actions have been discussed with the Integrity and Compliance Committee that would warrant separate disclosure in this annual report. Should there be any material compliance matters or material internal control weaknesses or improvements in the future, these will be addressed through the RCCs and discussed with the Audit Committee and external auditor and, where appropriate, disclosed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.\n\n## SpeakUp! reports\n\n|                                            | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total reports and alerts registered        | 238    | 222    | 250    |\n| Reports received through SpeakUp!          | 104    | 164    | 180    |\n| Integrity                                  | 50     | 59     | 61     |\n| Safety                                     | 6      | 5      | 21     |\n| Sustainability                             | 48     | 100    | 98     |\n| Dismissals resulting from SpeakUp! reports |        |        | 6      |\n| Conclusions SpeakUp! reports:              |        |        |        |\n| Substantiated                              | 14     | 28     | 27     |\n| Unsubstantiated                            | 42     | 82     | 70     |\n| Other (e.g. referred)                      | 48     | 54     | 46     |\n\nIn 2020, 56 reports and alerts were received outside our SpeakUp! mechanism, 43 of which were unsubstantiated, leading to 29 dismissals.",

Our strategy is aimed at long-term value creation.\n\nTo realize our strategy and create the long-term value we aim for, it's essential that we can attract and retain high caliber members to our Board of Management and Supervisory Board. This is reflected in the remuneration policies for each of these boards.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management (the 'Policy') was first adopted by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2005. It has undergone several amendments since then - most recently in 2018 - and was adopted by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 2020 (with 92% of votes in favor). Details about its implementation in 2020 can be found below in chapter 1.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board was adopted by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, with some limited changes being approved at the AGM in 2020 (with 99% of votes in favor). Details about the implementation of the current policy in 2020 are in chapter 2.\n\nThe execution of remuneration for both the Board of Management and Supervisory Board has been fully compliant with the applicable policies. The revised European directive on the encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement (SRD II), and its codification in Dutch law, have been considered in the disclosure presented in this report.\n\nFor a full description of the Remuneration Policy for both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, please visit our website.\n\nThe remuneration for the financial year 2020, as described in this report, is subject to an advisory vote at the 2021 AGM. Questions raised in the 2020 AGM regarding remuneration items were addressed in the respective meeting, resulting in 94% votes in favor of the 2019 Remuneration report.\n\n## 1.  REMUNERATION FOR THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Policy is designed to enable the Board of Management to achieve the company's objectives, while balancing the perspectives of shareholders and other key stakeholders. The focus on performance is achieved by including both short- and long-term incentives, to ensure that the Board of Management reaches the annual expected level of performance, while bearing in mind the sustainability of the company.\n\nThe remuneration principles that apply for the Board of Management are aligned with those applied more broadly in the company. This provides a shared sense of purpose and direction at different management levels and a shared reward when success is achieved.\n\nWhen implementing the Policy, the Remuneration Committee consults with external remuneration professionals to obtain appropriate benchmark data, and on other matters where it requires independent advice.\n\nVariable remuneration provides an incentive to realize long-term value creation. For the short term, the Supervisory Board sets operational targets over a one-year period that are crucial to the company and are pre-conditions to value creation. The biggest portion of the remuneration packages of Board of Management\n\nmembers is directly aimed at strategic priorities that will contribute to building sustainable long-term value creation, with targets for the return for shareholders and the return on invested capital. Following the separation of Specialty Chemicals, a one-off long-term incentive to reward bringing value creation at a higher level has been added for the performance period 2018-2020.\n\nPrior to agreeing on incentives, the Remuneration Committee conducted scenario analyses of the possible financial outcomes of meeting different performance levels, and how they may affect the structure and value of the Board of Management's total remuneration.\n\nIn 2020, the labor market peer group, as referred to in the Policy, consisted of the following companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Ahold Delhaize\n- \u00b7 RELX Group\n- \u00b7 Air Liquide\n- \u00b7 ASML\n- \u00b7 DSM\n- \u00b7 Sherwin-Williams\n- \u00b7 Ferro Corporation  \u00b7 Signify\n- \u00b7 Henkel\n- \u00b7 Sika\n- \u00b7 KPN\n- \u00b7 The Linde Group\n- \u00b7 LafargeHolcim\n- \u00b7 Vopak\n- \u00b7 PPG Industries\n- \u00b7 Wolters Kluwer\n- \u00b7 Randstad\n\nOne table on page 79 specifies the elements of the Remuneration Policy, describing purpose, design and the link to our company strategy, as well as their (potential) value. The other table on page 79 gives an overview of the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management who were in office in 2020. Although we temporarily suspended our financial ambition as a result of COVID-19, no changes were made to the incentive plans of the Board of Management.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of members of the Board of Management during the year, considering market data, inflation data\n\n- \u00b7 RPM International",

The test also included an assessment of the progress made with the strategic objectives under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee subsequently determined that bonus payments for the Board of Management would be:\n\n- \u00b7  Thierry Vanlancker, CEO: \u20ac1,139,124 (110.22% of salary)\n- \u00b7  Maarten de Vries, CFO: \u20ac498,256 (71.64% of salary)\n\nNo matching shares were granted to the CEO or CFO in 2020, as this arrangement has been suspended for the period 2018 to 2020. The value of the share-matching plan for these three years is invested in the 2020 Performance Incentive Plan.\n\n## LONG-TERM INCENTIVES (LTI)\n\n## Conditional grant LTI share plan 2020-2022\n\nThe Remuneration Committee determines the grant levels to be made in respect of members of the Board of Management, within the limits and plans that have been approved by shareholders. In 2020, the CEO and CFO received a conditional grant of shares equivalent to the face value of 150% of their annual base salaries. The grant price was determined based on the average share price of an AkzoNobel common share in the two weeks following publication of the annual results on February 12, 2020:\n\n- \u00b7  18,747 shares were conditionally granted to Thierry Vanlancker, CEO\n- \u00b7  12,616 shares were conditionally granted to Maarten de Vries, CFO\n\nVesting of the conditional grant is linked to two performance metrics:\n\nreturn on investment (ROI) and relative total shareholder return (TSR), equally weighted and independently determining 50% of the LTI vesting. The Supervisory Board reviews ROI performance measure and target each year and ensures that both are directly linked to the strategic direction.\n\nThe performance level determines: (i) the performance level below which no shares vest; (ii) the performance level at which the target number of shares vest; and (iii) the performance level at which the maximum number of shares vest.\n\nTSR is measured relative to an industry peer group, consisting of the following nine companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Asian Paints\n- \u00b7 PPG\n- \u00b7 Axalta\n- \u00b7 Kansai Paint\n- \u00b7 Masco Corp\n- \u00b7 Sherwin-Williams\n- \u00b7 Nippon Paint\n- \u00b7 Tikkurilla\n\nThis industry peer group is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the companies in the group remain appropriate peers.\n\nThe vesting schedule that will apply to the relative TSR metric is listed in the table below. When making the performance assessment, the TSR result of AkzoNobel is included within the ranked peer group.\n\n## Relative TSR vesting scheme for the conditional grants\n\n| Rank   |   Vesting (as % of 50%  of conditional grant) |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1      |                                           150 |\n| 2      |                                           135 |\n| 3      |                                           120 |\n| 4      |                                           100 |\n| 5      |                                            75 |\n| 6      |                                            50 |\n| 7      |                                            25 |\n| 8-10   |                                             0 |\n\n## Vesting of the LTI Share Plan 2018-2020\n\nUnder the LTI Share Plan 2018-2020, a conditional grant of 20,200 shares was\n\n- \u00b7 RPM International\n\nmade to the CEO and a conditional grant of 17,200 shares made to the CFO.\n\nIn line with the Remuneration Policy, vesting of 50% of the shares conditionally granted is linked to AkzoNobel's ROI performance. The company's ROI performance at the end of the performance period was reviewed by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board recognized that the initial ROI target was not fully in line with the company's new strategy. They decided not to adjust the target, but to apply their discretionary power and to evaluate performance against the ROI target as defined and communicated at the beginning of 2020. This resulted in a vesting of 106% for this specific part of the long-term incentive.\n\nFor the 2018 conditional grant, 50% was linked to AkzoNobel's relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance compared with the companies in a defined industry peer group. Independent external experts conducted an analysis to calculate the number of shares that will vest according to the TSR ranking. In order to adjust for changes in exchange rates, all local currencies were converted into euros.\n\nAkzoNobel's TSR performance during the period 2018 to 2020 resulted in the sixth position within the ranking of the peer group companies. This ranking resulted in a vesting of 50% for this part of the long-term incentive.\n\nBased on the company's combined ROI and TSR performance, the final vesting percentage of the 2018 conditional grant - after including the dividend yield of 14.37% during the performance period equaled 89.21%.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee determined that:\n\n- \u00b7  Thierry Vanlancker would vest 18,020 shares, subject to a further two-year holding requirement. At December 31, 2020, these shares had a market value of \u20ac1,583,237",

It supports achievement of 15% ROS (excluding unallocated corporate center cost) by the end of 2020, presented to shareholders as financial guidance towards upper quartile industry performance.\n\nThe Supervisory Board set the ROS to be achieved by the end of 2020 as shown in the table below.\n\nIn determining the outcome of the Performance Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee applied a reasonableness test in which the actual level of the performance was critically assessed in light of the assumptions made at the beginning of the year and\n\nthe decision to pause and suspend the 15 by 20 ambition. The test also included an assessment of the progress made with the strategic objectives under prevailing market conditions.\n\nActual ROS performance was 15.0% (excluding unallocated cost). The Remuneration Committee subsequently determined that payments for the Board of Management would be:\n\n- \u00b7  Thierry Vanlancker, CEO: \u20ac2,067,000 (200% of salary)\n- \u00b7  Maarten de Vries, CFO: \u20ac1,391,000 (200% of salary)\n\n## Claw back and value adjustment\n\nIn 2020, there was no cause for a claw back or value adjustment by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe company does not grant loans, advance payments or guarantees to members of the Supervisory Board, members of the Executive Committee or any family member of such persons.\n\n## Shareholding requirements and share matching\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, CEO Thierry Vanlancker held 43,518 shares, of which 1,720 qualified for share-matching under the Share-Matching Plan on a ratio 1:1. The matching shares were conditionally granted in 2018 and will be released in 2021, subject to the terms of the Share-Matching Plan. Shares acquired in 2020 by the CEO contribute towards his required shareholding. On December 31, 2020, he fulfilled this requirement by holding the equivalent of 370% of his annual base salary in shares.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, CFO Maarten de Vries held 5,678 shares. The shares acquired by the CFO during 2020 contribute towards his required shareholding. On December 31, 2020, he did not yet fulfill the shareholding requirement of 150%, as the shares represented a value at that date of 72% of his annual base salary.\n\nShares obtained by members of the Board of Management under the performance-related share plan are\n\n## Performance range - 2020 Performance Incentive Plan\n\n|                 | Below threshold   | Threshold   | Target      | Maximum     |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 2020 ROS target | <14%              | 14%         | 15%         | \u226517%        |\n| Award level     | 0% of             | 100% of     | 200% of     | 400% of     |\n| Award level     | base salary       | base salary | base salary | base salary |",

become unconditional. This includes vested shares to be retained during the blocking period of two years after vesting.\n\n## Comparative information\n\nIn compliance with point (b), paragraph 1 of Article 9b of the EU Directive on long-term shareholder engagement, we present on this page:\n\n- \u00b7  The annual change of remuneration of each individual member of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  The performance of the company\n- \u00b7  The average remuneration on a fulltime equivalent basis of company employees over at least the five most recent financial years\n\nOver the last few years of transition, the company's performance fluctuated significantly as the table above shows. In 2018, net profit increased sharply, mainly due to the divestment of Specialty Chemicals, with a deal result of \u20ac5,811 million after tax. The transition was also reflected in the development of remuneration. Restructuring due to\n\ndiscontinued operations, for example, resulted in a reduction of the average salary per employee, followed by increases when operations stabilized and profits increased again. In 2018, the increase in average salary was also influenced by the inclusion of a one-off \u20ac57 million pension cost for the UK guaranteed minimum pension equalizations.\n\nThe pay ratio between the total com pensation of the CEO in 2020 and the total compensation of an AkzoNobel employee (calculated as an average of all employees as of December 31, 2020) is 99.2* (2019: 65.0).\n\n*The increase is mainly due to the 2020 Performance Incentive Plan payment. Without this one-off special payment the ratio would have been 62.3.\n\n## Post-contract compensation\n\nBoard of Management members receive contributions towards postcontract benefits, which are defined as a percentage of income, as deter mined by the Supervisory Board. Currently, they are based on age. Contributions are paid over the base salary in the current\n\nyear and vary de pending on the Board member's age.\n\n## Board contracts\n\nAgreements for members of the Board of Management are concluded for a period not exceeding four years. After the initial term, re-appointments may take place for consecutive periods of up to four years each. The notice period by the Board member, and by the company, shall be subject to a six-month term. Members of the Board of Management normally retire in the year they reach legal retirement age.\n\n## 2.  REMUNERATION FOR THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board receive a fixed remuneration based on roles and responsibilities. Travel expenses and facilities are borne by the company and reviewed by the Audit Committee.\n\nImplementation of the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board in 2020",

REMUNERATION POLICIES FOR THE NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board evaluated the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board considered input from stakeholders, the requirements of the EU Directive on the encouragement of longterm shareholder engagement (SRD II), and the Dutch regulation implementing this directive. As a result, a new policy was prepared for the remuneration of the Board of Management, to be submitted for approval at the AGM in April 2021.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management\n\nSince 2017, AkzoNobel has been focused on its Winning together: 15 by 20 strategy to deliver 15% ROS (excluding unallocated cost) in 2020. The company's new Grow & Deliver strategy, including ambitions for 202123, balances growth (at least in line with relevant markets) and profitability improvement (an average 50 basis points increase in ROS per year). The\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs official paint and coatings partner of the McLaren Racing team through our Sikkens brand, we were delighted to see them finish third in the 2020 F1 constructor standings. As well as supplying products for all painted parts of the race car, we also provided heat-shielding via our International product range.\n\nSupervisory Board has concluded that the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management should provide adequate and balanced remuneration in support of the new company strategy. For that purpose, a revised Remuneration Policy will be submitted to the AGM. The updated Remuneration Policy seeks to:\n\n- \u00b7  Attract and retain high caliber people to the Board of Management by offering competitive remuneration against a European peer group\n- \u00b7  Incentivize realization of the company's Grow & Deliver strategy and the short- and long-term ambitions through aligning metrics and targets around growth and delivery in STI and LTI\n- \u00b7  Deliver sustainable value creation for shareholders and other stakeholders, by setting focused LTI metrics and simplifying share matching\n\n## Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded that the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board - adopted by the AGM in 2014 and approved with some limited changes in 2020 - is in line with the objectives of the company, but a proposal is made to use a European peer group going forward to benchmark the remuneration levels it provides. This change in the Remuneration Policy will be submitted to the AGM in April 2021.\n\n## Comparative table of remuneration of the Supervisory Board over last five reported financial years\n\n| in \u20ac                                 | 2016    | 2017    | 2018      | 2019    | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Nils Smedegaard Andersen, Chairman 5 | -       | -       | 111,373   | 162,500 | 157,500 |\n| Anthony Burgmans 6                   | 165,000 | 169,400 | 53,215    | -       | -       |\n| Peggy Bruzelius 7                    | 113,800 | 116,200 | 119,318   | 37,710  | -       |\n| Byron Grote, Deputy Chairman 2       | 105,800 | 134,300 | 135,500   | 130,500 | 114,250 |\n| Louis Hughes 6                       | 116,200 | 120,000 | 32,322    | -       | -       |\n| Pamela Kirby 1                       | 57,050  | 100,000 | 92,500    | 92,500  | 87,500  |\n| Dick Sluimers                        | 87,500  | 95,000  | 107,500   | 107,500 | 90,000  |\n| Ben Verwaayen 9                      | 91,200  | 95,000  | 95,000    | 92,500  | 32,775  |\n| Sue Clark 4                          | -       | 7,900   | 87,995    | 92,500  | 87,500  |\n| Patrick Thomas 4                     | -       | 10,400  | 90,659    | 97,500  | 92,500  |\n| Michiel Jaski 4                      | -       | 5,400   | 78,159    | 87,500  | 85,000  |\n| Sari Baldauf 3                       | 107,500 | 100,000 | -         | -       | -       |\n| Jolanda Poots-Bijl 8                 | -       | -       | -         | 59,166  | 85,000  |\n| Total remuneration                   | 844,050 | 953,600 | 1,003,541 | 959,876 | 832,025 |\n| % change total remuneration          | 12.68   | 12.98   | 5.24      | (4.35)  | (13.32) |\n\n- 1 As of May 1, 2016. 2 Deputy Chairman as of October 18, 2016. 3 From May 1, 2016, until December 1, 2017. 4 As of November 30, 2017.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CON\u00ad SOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNote 1\n\n## Summary of signi/ficant accounting policies\n\n## GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a company headquartered in the Netherlands.The address of our registered office is Christian Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam; the Chamber of Commerce number is 09007809. We have attached a list of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, drawn up in conformity with Articles 379 and 414 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, as an Appendix to our annual report.\n\nWe have prepared the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. They also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Management report within the meaning of Article 391 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code consists of the following parts of the annual report:\n\n- \u00b7  2020 results at a glance\n- \u00b7  CEO statement\n- \u00b7  How we delivered on 15 by 20\n- \u00b7  How we created value\n- \u00b7  Strategy and operations\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Our Board of Management and Executive Committee\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Statement of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Corporate governance statement\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Risk management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Integrity and compliance management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Remuneration report\n- \u00b7  Financial information: Note 6 Operating income\n- \u00b7  Financial information: Note 27 Financial risk management\n\nThe section How we created value provides information on the developments during 2020 and the results. This section also provides information on cash flow and net debt, capital expenditures, innovation activities and employees.\n\nOn February 16, 2021, the Board of Management authorized the financial statements for issue. The financial statements as presented in this report are subject to adoption by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on April 22, 2021.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Akzo Nobel N.V. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are companies over which Akzo Nobel N.V. has control, because it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect returns through its power over the subsidiary. Non-controlling interests in equity and in results are presented separately.\n\n## CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND FIRST TIME APPLICATION\n\nAccounting pronouncements, which became effective for 2020 (amendments to IFRS 3 'Definition of a Business', amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1', amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 'Definition of Material', 'Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards' and the amendment to IFRS 16 'COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions') had no material impact on our Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (NOTE 2)\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of our business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed\n\nof or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction within one year rather than through continuing use. When reclassifying assets and liabilities as held for sale, we recognize the assets and liabilities at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated and amortized but tested for impairment. In case of discontinued operations, the comparative figures in the Consolidated statement of income and Consolidated statement of cash flows are represented. The balance sheet comparative figures are not represented.\n\n## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (NOTE 4)\n\nOur Alternative Performance Measures (APM) are based on IFRS measures and exclude so-called identified items. Identified items are special charges and benefits, results on acquisitions and divestments, major restructuring and impairment charges, and charges and benefits related to major legal, environmental and tax cases.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are used to judge the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most critical accounting policies involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of valuation and for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those recorded in the financial statements are the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Scope of consolidation (Note 2)\n- \u00b7  Discontinued operations and held for sale (Note 2)\n- \u00b7  Income tax and deferred tax assets, including uncertain tax positions (Note 9)",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7  Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (Note 11, 12, 13)\n- \u00b7  Post-retirement benefit provisions (Note 19)\n- \u00b7  Provisions and contingent liabilities (Note 20)\n\n## COVID-19 IMPACT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe pandemic situation in 2020 has been closely monitored and appropriate measures have been taken to continue serving our customers and save costs, while at the same time keeping the organization intact and able to respond quickly to changes in end market demand. The overall impact on AkzoNobel for the full-year 2020 was limited. An overall positive impact was noted for the Decorative Paints segment, whereas there was an overall adverse impact in the Performance Coatings segment. The pandemic has not impacted our going concern assumption.\n\nAkzoNobel has a strong balance sheet and solid cash position. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were \u20ac1.6 billion and financial leverage (net debt/ EBITDA) was 0.8. AkzoNobel is committed to retain a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nIn 2020, a detailed assessment was performed of potential valuation adjustments to the overall asset base, either due to the direct impact of COVID-19 or due to its impact on future profitability. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests have been performed based on most recently updated forecasts. Recoverability of deferred tax assets has also been reassessed based on these forecasts. Furthermore, an assessment was performed with regard to the allowance for impairment of trade receivables, also taking into account potential additional risk associated with COVID-19.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on the Financial Statements has been considered for each of the relevant notes, and additional disclosures have been provided in case COVID-19 had a material impact on a specific Financial Statements section. The Financial Statements sections for which this is relevant include:\n\n- \u00b7  Government support received and recorded as credit to employee benefits (Note 7)\n- \u00b7  Income tax and the valuation of deferred tax assets (Note 9)\n- \u00b7  Intangible assets and the annual impairment testing process (Note 11)\n- \u00b7  Valuation of trade receivables (Note 17).\n\nIn our 2020 figures, all COVID-19 related impacts have been treated as normal operations; none of these impacts have been included in identified items.\n\n## STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n\nWe have used the indirect method to prepare the statement of cash flows. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated at transaction rates. Acquisitions or divestments of subsidiaries are presented net of cash and cash equivalents acquired or disposed of, respectively. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged items.\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nWe determine and present operating segments based on the information that is provided to the Executive Committee, our chief operating decision-maker during 2020, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Segment results reported to the Executive Committee include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly of corporate assets and corporate costs and are reported in 'Corporate and other'.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCIES\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the foreign exchange rate at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Resulting foreign currency differences are included in the statement of income in financing income and expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at acquisition date.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of entities with other functional currencies are translated into euros, the functional currency of the parent entity, using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The income and expenses of entities with other functional currencies are translated into the functional currency, using the exchange rates at transaction date.\n\nWhen a subsidiary is operating in a hyperinflationary country, the financial statements of this entity are restated into the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period. Hyperinflation accounting is applied for Argentina.\n\nForeign exchange differences resulting from translation into the functional currency of investments in subsidiaries and of intercompany loans of a permanent nature with other functional currencies are recorded as a separate component (cumulative translation reserve) within other comprehensive income. These cumulative translation adjustments are reclassified (either fully or partly) to the statement of income upon disposal (either fully or partly) or liquidation of the foreign subsidiary to which the investment or the intercompany loan with a permanent nature relates to. Foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a financial liability designated as an effective hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in the cumulative translation reserve (in other comprehensive income).\n\n## EXCHANGE RATES OF KEY CURRENCIES\n\nThe principal exchange rates against the euro used in preparing the balance sheet and the statement of income are:\n\n|                |   Balance sheet |   Balance sheet | Balance sheet   |   Statement of income |   Statement of income | Statement of income   |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                |        2019     |        2020     | %               |              2019     |              2020     | %                     |\n| US dollar      |           1.121 |           1.229 | 9.6             |                 1.12  |                 1.143 | 2.1                   |\n| Pound sterling |           0.854 |           0.9   | 5.4             |                 0.878 |                 0.889 | 1.3                   |\n| Chinese yuan   |           7.808 |           7.992 | 2.4             |                 7.742 |                 7.875 | 1.7                   |\n| Brazilian real |           4.507 |           6.384 | 41.6            |                 4.414 |                 5.887 | 33.4                  |",

        "page_content": "## REVENUE RECOGNITION (NOTE 5)\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nAkzoNobel's main business consists of straightforward selling of goods (paints and coatings) to customers at contractually determined prices and conditions without any additional services. Although the transfer of risks and rewards is not the only criterion to be considered to determine whether control over the goods has transferred, it is in most situations considered to be the main indicator of the customer's ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the asset and largely also coincides with the physical transfer of the goods and the obligation of the customer to pay.\n\nVariable considerations, including among others rebates, bonuses, discounts and payments to customers, are accrued for as performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized. Variable considerations are only recognized when it is highly probable that these are not subject to significant reversal. In case of expected returns, no revenue is recognized for such products, but a refund liability and an asset for the right to recover the to be returned products are recorded. A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, generally based on historical warranty data.\n\nRevenue is recognized net of rebates, discounts and similar allowances, and net of sales tax.\n\n## Equipment provided to customers\n\nAkzoNobel regularly provides mixing machines, store interior and other assets to its customers at the start of a paints or coatings delivery contract. The delivery of such assets qualifies as a separate performance obligation. Revenue can only be recognized at the moment of transfer of such assets, when there is an agreed sales price or when there is a binding take-or-pay commitment for a minimum quantity of paints or coatings to be acquired by the customer.\n\n## Services\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain training, technical or support services to customers as well as shipping and handling activities for its customers. Service revenue is recognized over time when the related services are being provided. When not separately invoiced, part of the sales price of paints or coatings is allocated to such services.\n\n## POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS (NOTE 7, 19)\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of income as incurred.\n\nMost of our defined benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated in a trust or foundation. We also provide post-retirement benefits other than pensions to certain employees, which are generally not funded. Valuations of both funded and unfunded plans are carried out by independent actuaries based on the projected unit credit method. Post-retirement costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for projected benefits based on employee service during the year and interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset. When the calculation results in a benefit to AkzoNobel, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on the settlement of the plan liabilities. The effect of these so-called asset ceiling restrictions and any changes therein are recognized in other comprehensive income. Remeasurement gains and losses, which arise in calculating our obligations, are recognized in other comprehensive income. When the benefits of a plan improve, the portion of the increased benefits related to past service by employees is recognized as an expense in the statement of income immediately. We recognize gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nInterest on the net defined benefit liability/asset is included in financing expenses related to post-retirement benefits. Other charges and benefits recognized are reported in operating income, unless recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n## OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (NOTE 7, 20)\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits are measured at present value, using actuarial assumptions and methods. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (NOTE 7)\n\nAkzoNobel has a performance-related and a restricted share plan as well as a share-matching plan, under which shares are conditionally granted to certain employees. The fair value is measured at grant date and amortized over the three-year period during which the employees normally become unconditionally entitled to the shares with a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. Amortization is accelerated in the event of earlier vesting or settlement. In case of a plan modification, the fair value is increased when the change is beneficial to the employee.\n\n## INCOME TAX (NOTE 9)\n\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax, including effects of changes in tax rates. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax we also take into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. Income tax is recognized in the statement of income, unless it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or equity.\n\nCurrent tax includes the expected tax payable and receivable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at reporting date, as well as (any adjustments to) tax payables and receivables with respect to previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated financial statements. We do not recognize deferred tax for the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future and we can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.\n\nMeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted or substantially enacted tax",

        "page_content": "rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Income tax consequences are taken into account in the determination of deferred tax liabilities to the extent earnings are expected to be distributed by subsidiaries in the foreseeable future and AkzoNobel has control over dividend distribution. Deferred tax positions are not discounted.\n\n## EARNINGS PER SHARE (NOTE 10)\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year adjusted for any repurchased shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year for the diluting effect of the shares of the performance-related share plan, the restricted share plan and the sharematching plan.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share represents the basic earnings per share from continuing operations excluding identified items, after taxes.\n\n## GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n\nGovernment grants related to costs (which include grants related to COVID-19) are deducted from the relevant costs to be compensated in the same period. Government grants to compensate for the cost of an asset are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Emission rights granted by the government are recorded at cost. A provision is recorded if the actual emission is higher than the emission rights granted.\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS (NOTE 11)\n\nIntangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill and certain brands, are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually using the value-in-use method. Goodwill in a business combination represents the excess of the\n\nconsideration paid over the net fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of an acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of income. The effects of all transactions with non-controlling interest shareholders are recorded in equity if there is no change in control.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life, such as licenses, know-how, certain brands, customer relationships, intellectual property rights, emission rights and capitalized development and software costs, are capitalized at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which generally ranges from 5 to 40 years for brands with finite useful lives, 5 to 25 years for customer lists and 3 to 15 years for other intangibles. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Research expenditures are recognized as an expense as incurred.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (NOTE 12)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including borrowing cost of capital investment projects under construction.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life of the asset components.The useful life of plant equipment and machinery generally ranges from 10 to 25 years, and for buildings ranges from 20 to 50 years. Land is not depreciated. In the majority of cases, residual value is assumed to be not significant. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.\n\nCosts of major maintenance activities are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life. Maintenance costs which cannot be separately defined as a component of property, plant and equipment are expensed in the period in which they occur. We recognize conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the cash outflow.\n\n## LEASES (NOTE 13, 21)\n\nWe assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of cars we have elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nWe recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the present value of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset value contains lease prepayments, lease incentives received, the initial direct costs and an estimate of restoration, removal and dismantling costs.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term or shorter economic life. In addition, the value of right-of-use assets is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe net present value of the lease liability is measured at the discounted value of the lease payments. The liability includes payments to be made in optional periods if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The lease payments comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives\n- \u00b7  Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate\n- \u00b7  The exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised\n- \u00b7  Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease\n- \u00b7  Amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees",

        "page_content": "These lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease contract, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate is used. We determine our incremental borrowing rates by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and make certain adjustments to reflect the term of the lease and type of the asset leased. At the lease commencement dates, we assess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. We reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options, if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within our control.\n\nAt the commencement date, we assess whether it is reasonably certain that:\n\n- \u00b7  An option to extend is exercised; or\n- \u00b7  An option to purchase is exercised; or\n- \u00b7  An option to terminate the lease is not exercised In making these assessments, all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for us to exercise, or not to exercise, the option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option are considered.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nWe do not record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. We recognize the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## IMPAIRMENTS (NOTE 11, 12, 13)\n\nWe assess the carrying value of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, for goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, the carrying value is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income on the function level of the asset impaired. The assessment for impair-\n\nment is performed at the lowest level of assets generating largely independent cash inflows. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life, we have determined this to be at business unit level (one level below segment).\n\nExcept for goodwill, we reverse impairment losses in the statement of income if and to the extent we have identified a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\n## ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (NOTE 14)\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Consolidated financial statements include our share of the income and expenses of the associates and joint ventures, whereby the result is determined using our accounting principles. When the share of losses exceeds the interest in the investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, unless we have legal or constructive obligations on behalf of the investee.\n\n## INVENTORIES (NOTE 16)\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of inventories comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. The costs of inventories are determined using weighted average cost.\n\n## PROVISIONS (NOTE 20)\n\nWe recognize provisions when a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits is required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at net present value. The increase of provisions as a result of the passage of time is recognized in the statement of income under financing income and expenses.\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities are recognized when a detailed and formal restructuring plan has been approved, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. We do not provide for future operating costs.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Classi/fication\n\nAll assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets are classified according to a model based on:\n\n- \u00b7  A contractual cash flow characteristics test A business model dictating how the reporting entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows as either:\n- 1. Hold to collect contractual cash flows\n- 2. Collect contractual cash flows and sell 3. Neither 1 or 2\n- \u00b7  Election of the fair value option in some specific cases in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is determined at initial recognition, but if certain conditions are met, an asset might be subject to reclassification.\n\n## Valuation and impairment\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for impairment either according to the general approach or a simplified approach.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the general approach uses the following stages:\n\n- \u00b7  12-month expected credit losses; taking in account possible default events within one year\n- \u00b7  Lifetime expected credit losses in case of an increase in credit risk; through recognition of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the exposure\n- \u00b7  Lifetime expected credit losses, where interest is calculated on the net amount of the receivables less impairment loss\n\nIn all above stages, the impairment calculation used at AkzoNobel is based on external credit ratings of involved parties or default rates published by well-known credit risk agencies.",

        "page_content": "The financial assets included in the general impairment approach are long-term loans and other long-term receivables.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the simplified approach requires recognition of lifetime expected credit loss (no tracking of changes in credit risk). The financial assets included in the simplified impairment approach are trade receivables and the remaining financial assets.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegular purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized on trade date. The initial measurement of all financial instruments is at fair value. Except for derivatives and cash and cash equivalents, the initial measurement of financial instruments is adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Derivative /financial instruments (Note 27)\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair values are derived from market prices and quotes from dealers and brokers or are estimated using observable market inputs. When determining fair values, credit risk for our contract party, as well as for AkzoNobel, is taken into account.\n\nChanges in the fair value are recognized in the statement of income, unless cash flow hedge accounting or net investment hedge accounting is applied. In those cases, the effective part of the fair value changes is deferred in other comprehensive income and released to the related specific lines in the statement of income or balance sheet at the same time as the hedged item.\n\nFinancial non-current assets (Note 15) and Trade and other receivables (Note 17)\n\nLoans and receivables are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.\n\nCash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments (Note 21)\n\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are measured at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and other investments that are directly convertible into known amounts of cash. Changes in fair values are included in financing income and expenses.\n\nLong-term and Short-term borrowings (Note 21, 27) and Trade and other payables (Note 22)\n\nLong-term and short-term borrowings, as well as trade and other payables, are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. The interest expense on borrowings is included in financing income and expenses. The fair value of borrowings, used for disclosure purposes, is determined based on listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, the fair value is calculated based on the present value of principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the interest rate at the reporting date, considering AkzoNobel's credit risk.\n\n## NEW IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nIFRS standards and interpretations thereof not yet in force, which may apply to our Consolidated financial statements for 2021 and beyond, have been assessed for their potential impact. These include among others amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2', amendments to in IFRS 3 'References to the Conceptual Framework', amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use', amendments to IAS 37 'Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract', AIP IFRS 9 'Financial instruments - Fees in the '10 percent' test for derecognition of financial liabilities', IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' and Amendments to IAS 1 'Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current'. These changes are not expected to have a material effect on AkzoNobel's Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\n## Material subsidiaries\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 283 legal entities. We consider legal entities material when they represent, for at least two subsequent years, more than 5% of either revenue or adjusted operating income or based on qualitative aspects. Material subsidiaries included in the table in this Note are fully owned at year-end 2020.\n\n## Material subsidiaries related to continuing operations\n\n| Legal entity                         | Principal place of  business/country of  incorporation   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings Inc.             | US                                                       |\n| Akzo Nobel Paints (Shanghai) Co Ltd. | China                                                    |\n| Imperial Chemical Industries Limited | UK                                                       |\n| Akzo Nobel Decorative Coatings B.V.  | Netherlands                                              |\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings SPA              | Italy                                                    |\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn November 8, 2019, we acquired Mapaero in France to further strengthen our global position in the aerospace coatings industry. In 2019, we performed a preliminary purchase price allocation, resulting in \u20ac83 million of goodwill, that has been fully allocated to business unit Automotive and Specialty Coatings. The purchase price allocation was completed in 2020, resulting in \u20ac6 million higher goodwill, \u20ac10 million lower intangibles and \u20ac4 million lower deferred tax liabilities.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Mauvilac Industries Limited, a leading paints and coatings company on Mauritius, for \u20ac33 million. The business generated revenue of \u20ac17 million (unaudited) in 2019. This transaction resulted in \u20ac12 million goodwill and \u20ac19 million of intangibles, both fully allocated to business unit Decorative Paints Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n\nOn December 23, 2020 we completed the acquisition of New Nautical Coatings Inc. in the US for \u20ac59 million. This company owns the globally and nationally recognized brands of Sea Hawk Paints, Flexdel and Blue Water Marine Paint. The business generated revenue of",

The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at grant date (opening of first trading date from grant date), expected volatility (based on the share price development over the past three years of AkzoNobel), and risk-free interest rate (based on a Dutch zero-coupon government bond).\n\n## Share-matching plan\n\nThe members of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee are eligible to participate in the share-matching plan. However, they will not be eligible for matching shares for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. Under certain conditions, members who invest part of their short-term incentive in AkzoNobel shares may have such shares matched by the company. During 2020, 3,361 potential matching shares were matched, leading to a total of 1,720 potential matching shares on December 31, 2020.

Including these results, the effective consolidated tax rate is 27.1% (2019: 28.4%).\n\nNon-deductible expenses are mainly related to base erosion, non-deductible interest and the effects of Argentina hyperinflation accounting. The non-taxable income is mainly related to the Innovation box in the Netherlands, R&D credits and the tax exemption for investments.\n\nThe impact of non-refundable withholding tax on the tax rate is dependent on our relative share in the profit of subsidiaries in countries that levy withholding tax on dividends and on the timing of the remittance of such dividends. Based on the Dutch tax system there is a limited credit for such taxes.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\n| in/uni00A0%                                          | 2019   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Corporate tax rate in the Netherlands                | 25.0   | 25.0   |\n| Effect of tax rates in other countries               | (2.2)  | (0.4)  |\n| Weighted average statutory income  tax rate          | 22.8   | 24.6   |\n| Non-taxable income                                   | (1.0)  | (1.2)  |\n| Non-deductible expenses                              | 3.2    | 1.8    |\n| (De)recognition of deferred tax assets               | 5.8    | (0.1)  |\n| Non-refundable withholding taxes                     | 0.4    | 0.6    |\n| Adjustment for prior years                           | (0.2)  | 0.2    |\n| Deferred tax adjustment due to changes  in tax rates | (1.7)  | 0.3    |\n| Effective tax rate                                   | 29.3   | 26.2   |",

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could change in the near term if future estimates of projected taxable income during the carryforward period are revised. The majority of the amount of the non-current portion of deferred or current taxes will be recovered or settled after more than 12 months.\n\nIn 2020, deferred tax asset recoverability has been assessed using taxable profit forecasts, which take the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future results into account. These assessments showed sufficient taxable profit to recover previously recognized deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions, whilst in some jurisdictions this resulted in minor derecognitions or re-recognitions, with a net effect of a re-recognition of deferred tax assets of \u20ac4 million. Deferred tax assets not recognized relate to tax loss carryforwards.\n\nDue to the divestment of the Specialty Chemicals business in 2018, the company has been reorganizing itself into a focused Paints and Coatings company. In 2019, this resulted in a simplification of the intercompany financing structure, enlarging the scope of the global business support services, centralizing R&D and supply chain functions and implementing other cost saving initiatives. This has substantially affected the income generated and expenses incurred by subsidiaries in most countries, because intercompany interest, cost sharing and royalty flows, albeit all remaining at arm's length, have changed following these changes in the business set up. For subsidiaries in several countries in Europe, these changes in future profitability led to the derecognition or re-recognition of deferred tax assets. In aggregate, the net effect of the derecognition and re-recognition of deferred tax assets in 2019 was a charge of \u20ac47 million.\n\nFrom the total amount of recognized net deferred tax assets, \u20ac196 million (2019: \u20ac345 million) is related to\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities 2020\n\n| In \u20ac millions                      | Balance at  January 1, 2020   | Changes in  exchange rate   | Recognized in  income   | Recognized in  equity/Other  comprehensive  income   | Acquisitions   | Balance at  December 31,  2020   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|\n| Intangible assets                  | (410)                         | 24                          | (31)                    | -

The impairment test is in principle based on cash flow projections of the five-year plan. Elements considered to determine if a different approach would be more appropriate are, among others, high growth/emerging economies, geo expansion opportunities, introduction of new product ranges and opportunities from market consolidation. In 2020, the above exception was applied for Decorative Paints Asia and Decorative Paints South America, for which the revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA-margin development projections were extrapolated beyond the five-year explicit forecast period for another five years, applying reduced average growth rates.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the projections for annual impairment testing are:\n\n- \u00b7  Revenue growth per year: based on actual experience, analysis of markets and GDP growth and the expected market share developments\n- \u00b7  Adjusted EBITDA-margin development per year: based on actual experience and management's long-term projections\n- \u00b7  Weighted average cost of capital per year: the pre-tax discount rate determined per business unit, reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifically associated with the business units\n\nFor all business units, a terminal value was calculated based on the long-term inflation expectations of 1.0%. The estimated pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. The discount rates are determined for each business unit and range from 8.9% to 14.5% (2019: 8.8% to 12.7%), with a weighted average of 9.6% (2019: 9.4%).\n\nSensitivity tests were performed for growth assumptions, adjusted EBITDA margin development assumptions and for the weighted average cost of capital. These sensitivity tests show that reasonably possible changes in these key assumptions would not cause carrying amounts to exceed recoverable amounts for any of the business units.\n\nIn 2020 and 2019, no impairment charges were recognized in relation to the annual impairment test.\n\nImpact COVID-19 on annual impairment testing process\n\nThe situation around COVID-19 is being closely monitored to ensure that the impact on estimated future cash\n\nflows is reflected in the models which are used to assess the valuation of the carrying value of AkzoNobel's asset base. In addition to the beforementioned annual impairment testing process, AkzoNobel has made a detailed assessment in the second quarter, specifically focussing on the potential impact of the pandemic. The outcome of both assessments showed sufficient headroom in all business units.\n\n## Speci/fic asset impairments\n\nIn 2020, no impairment charges were recorded in relation to specific assets. In 2019, impairment charges were recorded for Performance Coatings, following the implementation of our strategic portfolio review, which was determined to be a triggering event. As this portfolio review also included certain recently acquired and not yet integrated businesses to be divested, the goodwill related to these businesses was also included in the impairment review and subsequently impaired.\n\nNote 12\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Investments in property, plant and equipment\n\nThroughout 2020, AkzoNobel has continued to assess all investment opportunities to ensure the right capital and capacity allotment and have taken decisions accordingly. With an aim to reinforce capability to support customers and enhance our manufacturing and supply chain, AkzoNobel has, among others, invested in the Powder Coatings site in Como, Italy, which is expected to enable further automatization and operational efficiency with automated and integrated production lines. Another major investment has been initiated in Turkey to increase the product range in decorative and wood care paints and unlock further value engineering opportunities.\n\nWe continued to invest in High Point, North Carolina, to transform our wood coatings facility into a best-in-class manufacturing site.\n\n## Impairments\n\nIn 2020, no significant impairments were recognized. In 2019, impairments were recognized in Performance Coatings, following the implementation of our strategic portfolio review.",

This excludes so-called 'evergreens' or perpetual leases.\n\nTotal net cash out flow from financing activities related to leases recognized on the balance sheet was \u20ac105 million (2019: \u20ac108 million).

We propose a 2020 final dividend of \u20ac1.52 (2019: \u20ac1.49) per common share, which would equal a total 2020 dividend of \u20ac1.95 (2019: \u20ac1.90).\n\nIn line with our announcement on April 19, 2017, we have returned the vast majority of the net proceeds from the separation of the Specialty Chemicals business to our shareholders. The Extraordinary General Meeting of November 13, 2018, approved to return an amount of \u20ac2.0 billion to shareholders by means of a capital repayment and share consolidation, which was executed in\n\nJanuary 2019. A share consolidation ratio of 9:8 was applied.\n\nWe distributed \u20ac1.0 billion by means of a special cash dividend of \u20ac4.50 per common share (post consolidation) on February 25, 2019, in addition to the \u20ac1.0 billion special cash dividend already distributed in December 2017. The share buyback program to repurchase common shares up to the value of \u20ac2.5 billion was completed at the end of 2019, acquiring 31.2 million common shares, which all have been cancelled. On October 23, 2019, a \u20ac500 million share buyback program was announced, for which 0.4 million common shares were acquired in 2019 and 6.2 million shares in 2020, which have all been cancelled.\n\nOn October 21, 2020, a new \u20ac300 million share buyback program was announced for which 0.7 million shares were acquired in 2020, that have not yet been cancelled. The share buyback program is to be completed in the first half of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Post-retirement bene/fit provisions\n\nPost-retirement benefit provisions relate to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, including healthcare or welfare plans. The largest defined benefit pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the Akzo Nobel (CPS) Pension Scheme in the UK which together account for 86% of defined benefit obligations (DBO) and 91% of plan assets. Other pension plans include among others the largely unfunded plans in Germany, the plans in the US and certain other smaller plans in the UK. The benefits of these pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' compensation. The funding policy for the plans is consistent with local requirements in the countries of establishment. We also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands.\n\nValuations of the obligations under the plans are carried out regularly by independent qualified actuaries. We accrue for the expected costs of providing such postretirement benefits during the service years of the employees. Governance of the benefit plans is the responsibility of the Executive Committee Pensions. This committee provides oversight of the costs and risks of the plans including oversight of the impact of the plans on the company in terms of cash flow, pension expenses and the balance sheet. The committee develops and maintains policies on benefit design, funding, asset allocation and assumption setting.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nAlmost all of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new members since the early to mid-2000s, although in many plans long-serving employees continue to accrue benefits. For plans in the US, benefit accrual is frozen and employees participate in defined contribution plans for future service. In countries where plans are closed, new employees are eligible to join a defined contribution arrangement. In countries in high growth markets, pension schemes currently are not material. Unless mandated by law, it is our policy that any new plans are established as defined contribution plans.\n\nThe most significant risks that we run in relation to defined benefit plans are investment returns falling short of expectations, low discount rates, inflation exceeding\n\nexpectations, retirees living longer than expected and legislation changes. The assets and liabilities of each of the funded plans are held outside of the company in a trust or a foundation, which is governed by a board of fiduciaries or trustees, depending on the legal arrangements in the country concerned. The primary objective with regards to the investment of pension plan assets is to ensure that each individual plan has sufficient funds available to satisfy future benefit obligations in accordance with local legal and legislative requirements. For this purpose, we work closely with plan trustees or fiduciaries to develop investment strategies. Studies are carried out periodically to analyze and understand the trade-off between expected investment returns, volatility of outcomes and the impact on cash contributions. We aim to strike a cautious balance between these factors in order to agree affordable contribution schedules with plan fiduciaries.\n\nPlan assets principally consist of insurance (annuity) policies, long-term interest-earning investments and (investment funds with holdings primarily in) quoted equity securities. Our largest plans use derivatives (such as index futures, currency forward contracts and swaps) to reduce volatility of underlying variables, for efficient portfolio management and to improve the liability matching characteristics of the assets. Limits have been set on the use of derivatives which are periodically subject to review for compliance with the pension fund's investment strategy.\n\nIn line with our proactive pension risk management strategy, we seek to reduce risk in our pension plans over time. We continue to evaluate different potential derisking strategies and opportunities on an ongoing basis. Some future de-risking transactions may have both cash flow and balance sheet impacts which may be substantial, as have some of the de-risking actions already taken. The cost of fully removing risk would exceed estimated funding deficits.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2020, ICIPF and a smaller UK plan, the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund (ISCPF), have invested in annuity buy-in contracts that aim to hedge all key risks related to their pensioner populations. CPS has an insurance contract to hedge longevity risk in respect of a portion of its pensioners. In 2020, the Trustee of the ICIPF entered into a further annuity buy-in agreement with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited and the Trustee of the ISCPF entered into a further annuity\n\nbuy-in agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation plc. Together they cover, in aggregate, \u00a384 million (\u20ac94 million) of pensioner liabilities (insurer valuation). The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy under which the insurer will pay to ICIPF and ISCPF amounts equivalent to the benefits payable to members who have recently become pensioners. The pension liabilities remain with, and the matching annuity policies are held within, ICIPF and ISCPF. The accounting impact of the transaction is a lower valuation of the plan assets giving a reduction in Other comprehensive income of \u00a321 million (\u20ac23 million) of which \u00a318 million (\u20ac20 million) relates to ICIPF and \u00a33 million (\u20ac3 million) relates to ISCPF.\n\nBy purchasing bulk annuities, the ICIPF and ISCPF Trustees have both taken significant steps in actively de-risking liabilities and reducing the risk that AkzoNobel will be required to contribute additional cash in the future.\n\nIn October 2018, the UK High Court provided clarity for trustees and employers on providing equal pension benefits for men and women where they are in receipt of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs) as a result of the Lloyds Banking Group judgment. According to this judgment, pension schemes were required to retrospectively equalize GMPs by uplifting pensions to the same level, as far as needed, for men and women. On November 20, 2020, the High Court ruled that pension schemes will need to revisit individual transfer payments made since May 17, 1990, to check if any additional value is due as a result of GMP equalization. As a result, a past service cost of \u00a35 million (\u20ac6 million) has been charged across the AkzoNobel pension schemes in the UK in 2020.\n\nIn setting the discount rate assumption for calculating the DBO of each plan, the so called Willis Towers Watson (WTW) RATE:Link model is used for the majority of the plans in the group. RATE:Link had previously been using a Bloomberg fixed income securities Bloomberg Industry Classification Standard (BICS) framework to provide the relevant inputs. However, due to a change in the Bloomberg BICS framework in 2020, this framework is no longer deemed suitable and RATE:Link now uses the Bloomberg BCLASS framework. Although the curve-fitting methodology has not changed in 2020, the change in Bloomberg framework used by RATE:Link has resulted in an estimated net \u20ac170 million remeasurement gain included in Other comprehensive income.

Broadly this is expected to result in RPI inflation being 1% lower in the longer term than under the existing methodology. The inflation assumption continues to be calculated using a market breakeven inflation rate. However, the CPI inflation assumption, on which the benefits of some plans are based, is set with reference to RPI. Until 2030, the CPI inflation assumption is calculated as 1% below RPI and from 2030 onwards as 0.1% below RPI. The impact has been recognized within remeasurements in Other comprehensive income. The impact on the actuarial loss due to liability financial assumption changes in the DBO is partially offset by an impact on the experience gain in plan assets in respect of the UK buy-in annuity policies and is not material.\n\nThe remaining pension plans primarily represent plans accounted for as defined contribution plans. This includes, among others, the Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands and the 401k Plan in the US. The ITP2 plan in Sweden is financed through insurance with the Alecta insurance company and is classified as a multi-employer defined benefit plan. As AkzoNobel does not have access to sufficient information from Alecta to enable a defined benefit accounting treatment, it is accounted for as a defined contribution plan.\n\nContributions in 2020 were \u20ac1 million (2019: \u20ac1 million). Alecta's funding ratio in 2020 is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 175%. The most recently quoted ratio at December 2020 stood at 148%. The expenses of all plans accounted for as defined contribution plans in AkzoNobel totaled \u20ac82 million in 2020 (2019: \u20ac86 million).\n\n## Other post-retirement bene/fit plans\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands. The risks to which the US healthcare plans expose AkzoNobel include the risk of future increases in the cost of healthcare which would increase the cost of maintaining the plans. The benefit payments to retirees under the Dutch plan are frozen. Both plans expose AkzoNobel to the risk of a further decline in discount rates, which increases the plan obligations, and longevity risk as the plans generally pay lifetime benefits.\n\n## Reconciliation balance sheet\n\nThe closing net balance sheet position of \u20ac827 million (2019: \u20ac668 million) includes the pension plans",

Administrative expenses are incurred, especially for the UK pension funds, of \u20ac18 million (2019: \u20ac19 million), which are included in operating income. In addition, we directly incurred asset management expenses of \u20ac2 million (2019: \u20ac4 million), which have been included in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Interest costs\n\nInterest costs on DBO for both pensions and other postretirement benefits, together with the interest income on plan assets, comprise the net financing income related to post-retirement benefits of \u20ac14 million (2019: \u20ac21 million), refer to Note 8.\n\n## Pension plans in asset position\n\nPension balances recorded under Financial non-current assets totaled \u20ac1,543 million (2019: \u20ac1,418 million). The increase in 2020 was due to \u20ac145 million of net actuarial gains, \u20ac45 million of employer contributions and net income of \u20ac7 million, partially offset by \u20ac72 million of exchange rate translation losses in the relevant plans. These assets could be recognized under IFRIC 14 because economic benefits are available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, either during the life of the plan or on the (final) settlement of the plan liabilities.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe equities and government bond debt assets have quoted prices in active markets, although most are held through funds comprised of such instruments which are not actively traded themselves. The total value of plan assets not quoted in active markets is \u20ac8,354 million (2019: \u20ac8,812 million, including the UK buy-in annuity policies totaling \u20ac7,595 million (2019: \u20ac8,018 million), investments in real estate, totaling \u20ac381 million (2019: \u20ac405 million) and other investments in infrastructure, catastrophe bonds, insurance policies and high-yield credit strategies. The UK buy-in annuity policies have a value that is equal to the DBO of the pensioners covered by the policies.

We expect to pay a further \u20ac11 million (2020: \u20ac13 million) to our other post-retirement benefit plans. No allowance is made for any special one-off contributions that may arise in relation to new de-risking opportunities.\n\nThe sensitivity effect on DBO shown allows for an alternative value for each assumption while the other actuarial assumptions remain unchanged. While this table illustrates the overall impact on DBO of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the total DBO. In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for each plan.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of the DBO under market",

Its results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in the key actuarial assumptions may have on the total DBO. Furthermore, the analysis does not indicate a probability of such changes occurring and it does not necessarily represent our view of expected future changes in DBO. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-retirement defined benefit plans are not reflected in this analysis, as they would normally be reflected in plan asset changes rather than DBO changes.\n\nThe sensitivities in the table only apply to the DBO and not to the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet.

unless indicated otherwise.\n- 2 Based on local valuation regulations.\n- 3 Actual rate at time of transfer.\n\nNote 20\n\n## General\n\nProvisions are recognized when an outflow of economic benefits for settlement is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated. It should be understood that, in light of possible future developments, such as: (a) potential additional lawsuits; (b) possible future settlements; and (c) rulings or judgments in pending lawsuits, certain cases may result in additional liabilities and related costs. At this point in time, we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts with sufficient certainty to allow such amount or range of amounts to be meaningful. While the outcome of said cases, claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe, based upon legal advice and information received, that the final outcome will not materially affect our consolidated financial position but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.\n\n## Provisions for restructuring of activities\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities comprise of accruals for certain employee benefits and for costs which are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific activities and closing down of facilities. For all restructuring provisions, a detailed formal plan exists and the implementation of the plan has started or the plan has been announced before the balance sheet date. Most restructuring plans are expected to be completed within one year from the balance sheet date.\n\n## Environmental liabilities\n\nWe are confronted with costs arising out of environmental laws and regulations, which include obligations to eliminate or limit the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain wastes or substances at various sites. Proceedings involving environmental matters, such as the alleged discharge of chemicals or waste materials into the air, water, or soil, are pending against us in various countries. In some cases, this concerns sites divested in prior years or derelict sites belonging to companies acquired in the past.\n\nThe provision has been discounted using an average pre-tax discount rate of 0.3% (2019: 1.4%).",

The majority of the cash outflows related to liabilities to (former) employees is expected to occur after five years. In calculating the liabilities to (former) employees, a pretax discount rate of on average 0.6% (2019: 1.0%) has been used.\n\n## Sundry provisions\n\nSundry provisions relate to a variety of provisions, including provisions for (customer) claims, sales returns, guarantees and other operational provisions. The majority of the cash outflows related to sundry provisions is expected to occur within one to five years. In calculating the sundry provisions, a pre-tax discount rate of on average negative 0.2% (2019: 1.2%) has been used.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nEnvironmental liabilities can change substantially due to the emergence of additional information on the nature or extent of the contamination, the geological circumstances, the necessity of employing particular methods of remediation, actions by governmental agencies or private parties, or other factors. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental exposures, it is reasonably possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs which,\n\nin management's opinion, based on information currently available, would not have a material effect on the company's financial position but could be material to the company's results of operations in any one accounting period.\n\nA number of claims against AkzoNobel are pending, all of which are contested. This includes a lawsuit filed in April 2019, by PT DWI Satrya Utama (PTDSU) against Akzo Nobel N.V., certain subsidiaries as well as certain subsidiary directors at the Tangerang District Court, Indonesia. PTDSU owns a 45% interest in PT ICI Paints Indonesia (PTICIPI), an indirect subsidiary of Akzo Nobel N.V., PTDSU alleges that it suffered damages as a result of defendants' improper management of PTICIPI. In March 2020, the District Court dismissed the case on the grounds that they do not have jurisdiction, against which the claimant appealed. In January 2021, the High Court of Indonesia rejected this appeal.\n\nWe are also involved in legal disputes and disputes with tax authorities in several jurisdictions. AkzoNobel has provided various indemnities and guarantees in respect of past divestments to the relevant purchasers and their permitted assigns (if applicable), which in general are capped in time and/or amount (in proportion to the value received). The provided guarantees and indemnities have varying maturity periods. AkzoNobel has received various claims under such indemnities and guarantees. In some\n\ninstances, AkzoNobel has been named as a direct defendant despite the divestments.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has withdrawn its declarations of joint and several liability under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for certain Dutch former Specialty Chemicals subsidiaries divested as per October 1, 2018, and is following the procedures to terminate its residual liability under those declarations under Article 404 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. One objection against the termination of residual liability is still pending and Akzo Nobel N.V. and Nouryon continue to cooperate to get this resolved.\n\n## Current portion of provisions\n\nThe current portion of post-retirement benefit provisions (\u20ac52 million) and the current portion of other provisions (\u20ac180 million) add up to \u20ac232 million (2019: \u20ac231 million), as reflected in the balance sheet.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe discount rates used in calculating the provisions recognized at December 31, 2020, are mentioned in the paragraphs on provisions for environmental costs, liabilities to (former) employees and sundry provisions. Changes in the discount rate will affect our consolidated financial position. A sensitivity test showed that a one percentage point increase or decrease of discount rates will have an impact down or up, respectively, of \u20ac9 million on the provisions recognized at December 31, 2020.",

This facility does not contain financial covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on adverse changes in ratings or material adverse change. At year-end 2020 and 2019, this facility has not been drawn.\n\nIn April 2020, a bond was issued with a nominal value of \u20ac750 million maturing in 2030 at a coupon rate of 1.625%.\n\nThe blended incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities at year-end 2020 was 1.9% (2019: 2.2%).\n\nAt year-end 2020 and 2019, none of the borrowings was secured by collateral.\n\n## Short-term borrowings\n\nWe have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the \u20ac1.3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility is not used.

These risks are inherent to the way we operate as a multinational with a large number of locally operating subsidiaries. Our overall risk management program seeks to identify, assess, and - if necessary - mitigate these financial risks in order to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance.\n\nOur risk mitigating activities include the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Board of Management is ultimately responsible for risk management. We centrally identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks, and monitor compliance with the corporate policies approved by the Board of Management, except for commodity risks, which are subject to identification, evaluation, hedging and monitoring in the businesses. We have treasury hubs located in Brazil and China that are primarily responsible for regional cash management and short-term\n\n## Maturity of liabilities and cash outflows\n\n| In \u20ac millions            | Less than  1/uni00A0year   | Between  1/uni00A0and/uni00A05/uni00A0years   | Over 5  years   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| At December 31, 2019     |                            |                                               |                 |\n| Borrowings               | 79                         | 1,259                                         | 521             |\n| Interest on borrowings   | 69                         | 182                                           | 8               |\n| Lease liabilities        | 90                         | 183                                           | 79              |\n| Trade and other payables | 2,388                      | -                                             | -               |\n| FX contracts (hedges)    |                            |                                               |                 |\n| Outflow                  | 2,468                      | -                                             | -               |\n| Inflow                   | (2,456)                    | -                                             | -               |\n| Total                    | 2,638                      | 1,624                                         | 608             |\n| At December 31, 2020     |                            |                                               |                 |\n| Borrowings               | 33                         | 1,259                                         | 1,274           |\n| Interest on borrowings   | 64                         | 152                                           | 54              |\n| Lease liabilities        | 86                         | 180                                           | 58              |\n| Trade and other payables | 2,572                      | -                                             | -               |\n| FX contracts (hedges)    |                            |                                               |                 |\n| Outflow                  | 1,570                      | -                                             | -               |\n| Inflow                   | (1,572)                    | -                                             | -               |\n| Total                    | 2,753                      | 1,591                                         | 1,386           |\n\nfinancing. We do not allow extensive treasury operations at subsidiary level directly with external parties.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe primary objective of liquidity management is to provide for sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all times and any place in the world to enable us to meet our payment obligations. We aim for a well-spread maturity schedule of our long-term borrowings and a strong liquidity position. At year-end 2020, we had \u20ac1.6 billion available as cash and cash equivalents (2019: \u20ac1.3 billion) and \u20ac250 million available as short-term investments (2019: \u20ac138 million), refer to Note 21.\n\nIn addition, we have a multi-currency revolving credit facility, which was amended in 2020 from \u20ac1.8 billion to \u20ac1.3 billion and extended to 2025. This facility does not contain financial covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on adverse changes in ratings or on other material adverse changes. At year-end 2020 and 2019, this",

We have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the \u20ac1.3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility is not used. We had no commercial paper outstanding at year end 2020 and 2019. The table on maturity of liabilities and cash outflows in this Note shows our cash outflows per maturity group. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.\n\n## CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCredit risk arises from financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, deposits with financial institutions, money market funds, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. We have a credit risk management policy in place to limit credit losses due to non-performance of financial counterparties and customers. We monitor our exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis at various levels. We only deal with financial counterparties that have a sufficiently high credit rating. Generally, we do not require collateral in respect of financial assets. Investments in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and transactions involving derivative financial instruments are entered into with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and a good reputation. Derivative transactions are concluded mostly with parties with whom we have contractual netting agreements and ISDA agreements in place. We set limits per counterparty for the different types of financial instruments we use. We closely monitor the acceptable financial counterparty credit ratings and credit limits and revise where required in line with the market circumstances. We do not expect non-performance by the counterparties for these financial instruments. Due to our geographical spread and the diversity of our customers, we were not subject to any significant concentration of credit risks at balance sheet date.\n\nThe credit risk from trade receivables is measured and analyzed at a local operating entity level, mainly by means of ageing analysis, refer to Note 17. Additionally, trade receivables and financial assets measured at amortized cost are subject to the expected credit loss impairment model either using the general or the simplified approach. For more information on the applied impairment approaches per financial asset type, refer to Note 1.\n\nGenerally, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of financial assets in the balance sheet.\n\nAt year-end 2020, the credit risk on consolidated level was \u20ac4.2 billion (2019: \u20ac3.7 billion) for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, loans, trade and other receivables. Our credit risk is well spread among both global and local counterparties. Our largest counterparty risk amounted to \u20ac450 million at year-end 2019 (2019: \u20ac380 million).\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Trade and /financing transactions\n\nWe operate in a large number of countries, where we have clients and suppliers, many of whom are outside of the local functional currency environment. This creates currency exposure which is partly netted out on group level. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the functional currency net cash flows resulting from trade or financing transactions are adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our policy is to hedge our transactional foreign exchange rate exposures above predefined thresholds from recognized assets and liabilities. Cash flow hedge accounting on forecasted transactions is applied by exception. Derivative transactions with external parties are bound by limits per currency.\n\nIn general, our forward exchange contracts have a maturity of less than one year. When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity. Currency derivatives are not used for speculative purposes.\n\n## Hedged notional amounts at year-end\n\n| In \u20ac millions   | Buy 2019   | Sell 2019   |   Buy 2020 | Sell 2020   |\n|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| US dollar       | 605        | 739         |        174 | 379         |\n| Pound sterling  | 599        | 136         |        485 | 31          |\n| Chinese yuan    | 48         | -           |         31 | -           |\n| Other           | 238        | 574         |        205 | 493         |\n| Total           | 1,490      | 1,449       |        895 | 903         |\n\nInvestments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nDuring 2020 and 2019, net investment hedge accounting was applied on hedges of certain net investments in foreign operations, which were partly hedged. The main net investments included were related to Chinese yuan (2020 and 2019) and Vietnamese dong (2020 and 2019), which were hedged with forward exchange contracts for the same currencies. The spot results related to these hedges were recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation reserves. At year-end 2020 one hedge of net investments in Polish zloty was outstanding. During 2020 and 2019, these hedges were fully effective.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe are partly financed with debt in order to obtain more efficient leverage. Fixed rate debt results in fair value interest rate risk. Floating rate debt results in cash flow interest rate risk. We treat fixed rate debt maturing within one year as floating rate debt for debt portfolio purposes. At the end of 2020 and 2019, the fixed/floating ratio of our outstanding bonds was 100% fixed as we have no outstanding bonds maturing within one year. During 2020 and 2019, we have not used any interest rate derivatives.\n\nIBOR reform refers to the global reform of interest rate benchmarks, which includes the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBOR) with alternative benchmark rates. Since our long-term borrowings have fixed interest rates and we currently do not have any interest related hedging instruments, the interest rate benchmark reform will not have a material impact on the company's financial statements. Fallback language has been added to our contracts while preparing for the transition to new rates.\n\n## CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOur objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our ability to satisfy our capital providers and to maintain a capital structure that optimizes our cost of capital. For this we maintain a conservative financial strategy, with the objective to remain a strong investment grade company as rated by the rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The capital structure can be altered, among others,",

In April 2020, a bond was issued with a nominal value of \u20ac750 million maturing in 2030 at a coupon rate of 1.625%. Consistent with other companies in the industry, we monitor capital headroom based on the leverage ratio net debt/EBITDA, for which we have set a target range of 1 to 2. The ratio was 0.8 in 2020 (2019: 0.7). EBITDA is the sum of operating income, depreciation and amortization; for 2020 amounting to \u20ac1,324 million (2019: \u20ac1,201 million). Net debt is calculated as the total of long and short-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments; for 2020 amounting to \u20ac1,034 million (2019: \u20ac802 million).\n\n## Fair value of /financial instruments and IFRS 9 categories\n\nIn the table 'Fair value per financial instrument category' insight is provided in the recognition of the respective financial instruments per IFRS 9 category. The total carrying value is based on the accounting principles as outlined in Note 1. Financial instruments are recognized at fair value and subsequently recognized either at fair value or at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. The financial instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are derivative financial instruments and securities included in financial non-current assets, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The remaining financial instruments are accounted for at amortized cost.\n\nThe following valuation methods for financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are distinguished:\n\n- \u00b7  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- \u00b7  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)\n- \u00b7  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable)\n\nFor the purpose of determining the fair value per financial instrument category, shown in the column 'Fair value', the following valuation methods were used:\n\nA level 1 valuation method was used to estimate the fair value of the bonds issued included in our long-term\n\n## Fair value per financial instrument category\n\n## Carrying value per IFRS 9 category\n\n| In \u20ac millions                | Carrying  amount   | Out of scope   of IFRS 7*   | Measured at  amortized  cost   | Measured  at fair value  through profit  or loss   | Total   carrying value   | Fair value   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|\n| 2019 year-end                |                    |                             |                                |                                                    |                          |              |\n| Financial non-current assets | 1,862              | 1,526                       | 210                            | 126                                                | 336                      | 364          |\n| Trade and other receivables  | 2,133              | 149                         | 1,975                          | 9                                                  | 1,984                    | 1,984        |\n| Short-term investments       | 138                | -

The estimate is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt with similar maturities.\n\nA level 2 valuation method was used to determine the fair value of marketable securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments by obtaining the market price at reporting date. The fair value of foreign currency contracts and swap contracts was determined by level 2 valuation techniques using market observable input (such as foreign currency interest rates based on Reuters) and by obtaining quotes from dealers and brokers. A level 2 valuation method was used to determine the fair value of time deposits included in cash and cash\n\nequivalents and short-term investments using the market interest rate. The carrying amounts of cash and banks, trade receivables less allowance for impairment, other short-term borrowings and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity period of those instruments and were determined using level 2 fair value methods. For \u20ac122 million of Financial non-current assets a level 3 fair valuation method (discounted cash flow) was used resulting in a deviation between the fair value and the carrying value.",

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of transactions outstanding in the same currency may be aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances\n\n- - e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs - all outstanding transactions under the agreement may be terminated, the termination value is assessed and a net amount is payable in settlement of the transactions. We have evaluated the potential effect of netting agreements, including the effect of rights of set-off and concluded the impact is immaterial.

Due to an intra-group funding restructuring, several intercompany loans were transferred in 2019 and 2020 from certain foreign subsidiaries to Akzo Nobel N.V.. Intercompany loans are priced at fair value at the date of the transfer, taking factors like the credit quality of AkzoNobel, country and currency risks into consideration.\n\nLoans to subsidiaries that will mature in 2021 amounted to \u20ac705 million and the remaining amount of \u20ac2,015 million will mature between 2022 and 2025. The remainder of the loans to subsidiaries has no fixed repayment schedule.\n\nNote E\n\nShort-term receivables\n\n## Short-term receivables\n\n| In \u20ac millions                 |   2019 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Receivables from subsidiaries |    117 |    125 |\n| FX contracts                  |      9 |     10 |\n| Other receivables             |     34 |     47 |\n| Total                         |    160 |    182 |\n\nShort-term receivables are expected to be settled within a year. Receivables from subsidiaries include interest to be received on intercompany loans in the amount of \u20ac9 million (2019: \u20ac2 million).\n\nThe holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. The holders of the priority shares are entitled to a dividend of 6% per share or the statutory interest in the Netherlands, whichever is lower, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. They are entitled to 800 votes per share (in accordance with the 800 times higher nominal value per share) at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. In addition, the holders of priority shares have the right to draw up binding lists of nominees for appointment to the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management; amendments to the Articles of Association are subject to the approval of the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares.\n\nPriority shares may only be transferred to a transferee designated by a Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares and against payment of the par value of the shares, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum or the statutory interest in the Netherlands, whichever is lower, for the period between the beginning of the year and the date of transfer. There are no restrictions on voting rights of holders of common or priority shares. The Articles of Association set out procedures for exercising voting rights. The Annual General Meeting of shareholders has resolved in 2020 to authorize the Board of Management for a period of 18 months (i) to issue shares (or grant rights to shares) in the capital of the company up to a maximum of 10%, which in case of mergers or acquisitions can be increased by up to a maximum of 10%, of the total number of shares outstanding (and to restrict or exclude the pre-emptive rights to those shares) and (ii) to acquire shares in the capital of the company, provided that the shares that will at any time be held will not exceed 10% of the issued share capital. The issue or repurchase of shares requires the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nDuring 2020, 9,331,481 common shares repurchased in 2019 and 2020 were cancelled (2019: 28,433,528 common shares). We held 695,776 common shares to be cancelled at year-end 2020 (year-end 2019: 3,165,967).\n\nOf the shareholders' equity of \u20ac5.7 billion, an amount of \u20ac5.4 billion (2019: \u20ac6.0 billion) was unrestricted and",

The contracts mainly related to US dollars and pound sterling and all have maturities within one year. These contracts offset the foreign exchange contracts concluded by the subsidiaries, and the fair value changes are recognized in the statement of income to offset the fair value changes on the contracts with the subsidiaries. For information on risk exposure and risk management, see Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note J Contingent liabilities\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is parent of the group's fiscal unity in the Netherlands, and is therefore liable for the liabilities of said fiscal unity as a whole.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has declared in writing that it accepts joint and several liability for contractual debts of certain Dutch consolidated companies (Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code). These debts, at year-end 2020, aggregating \u20ac0.4 billion (2019: \u20ac0.4 billion), are included in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has withdrawn its declarations of joint and several liability under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for certain Dutch former Specialty Chemicals subsidiaries divested as per October 1, 2018 and is following the procedures to terminate its residual liability under those declarations under Article 404 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. One objection against the termination of residual liability is still pending and Akzo Nobel N.V. and Nouryon continue to cooperate to get this resolved.\n\nAdditionally, at year-end 2020, guarantees were issued on behalf of consolidated companies for an amount of \u20ac0.3 billion (2019: \u20ac0.3 billion).\n\nThe debts and liabilities of the consolidated companies underlying these guarantees are included in the Consolidated balance sheet.\n\nA number of claims against Akzo Nobel N.V. are pending, all of which are contested. This includes a lawsuit filed in April 2019, by PT DWI Satrya Utama (PTDSU) against Akzo Nobel N.V., certain subsidiaries as well as certain subsidiary directors at the Tangerang District Court, Indonesia. PTDSU owns a 45% interest in PT ICI Paints Indonesia (PTICIPI), an indirect subsidiary of Akzo Nobel N.V.. PTDSU alleges that it suffered damages as a result of defendants improper management of PTICIPI. In March 2020, the District Court dismissed the case on the grounds that they do not have jurisdiction, against which the claimant appealed. In January 2021, the High Court of Indonesia rejected this appeal.\n\n## Note K Auditor's fees\n\nOur independent auditor, PwC, has rendered, for the period to which the audit of the financial statements relates, in addition to the audit of the statutory financial statements, mainly statutory audits of controlled entities.\n\n## Fees PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n| In \u20ac millions                      | In the   Netherlands   | Network  outside the  Netherlands   | 2020 Total   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Audit of the financial  statements | 4.3                    | 5.3                                 | 9.6          |\n| Other audit                        | 0.1                    | 0.2                                 | 0.3          |\n| Tax services                       | -                      | -                                   | -            |\n| Other non-audit  services          | -                      | -                                   | -            |\n| Total                              | 4.4                    | 5.5                                 | 9.9          |\n\n## Fees PricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n| In \u20ac millions                      | In the   Netherlands   | Network  outside the  Netherlands   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Audit of the financial  statements | 4.5                    | 6.0                                 | 10.5    |\n| Other audit services               | 0.3                    | 0.1                                 | 0.4     |\n| Tax services                       | -                      | -                                   | -       |\n| Other non-audit  services          | -                      | -                                   | -       |\n| Total                              | 4.8                    | 6.1                                 | 10.9    |\n\n2019\n\n## Amsterdam, February 16, 2021\n\nThe Board of Management\n\nThierry Vanlancker Maarten de Vries\n\nThe Supervisory Board\n\nNils Smedegaard Andersen Jolanda Poots-Bijl Sue Clark Byron Grote Michiel Jaski Pamela Kirby Dick Sluimers Patrick Thomas",

('the Company') give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2020 and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n\n## What we have audited\n\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements 2020 of Akzo Nobel N.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The financial statements include the Consolidated financial statements of the Group and the Company financial statements.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7  The Consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2020\n- \u00b7  The following statements for 2020: the Consolidated statement of income, the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows\n- \u00b7  The notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nThe Company financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7  The balance sheet as at December 31, 2020\n- \u00b7  The statement of income for the year then ended\n- \u00b7  The notes, comprising the accounting policies applied and other explanatory information\n\nThe financial reporting framework applied in the preparation of the financial statements is EU-IFRS and the relevant provisions of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Consolidated financial statements and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Company financial statements.\n\n## The basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with the European Union 'Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities', the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview and context\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a global paints and coatings company headquartered in the Netherlands and with operations in over 150 countries. Our group audit scope and approach are set out in the section 'The scope of our group audit'. In our audit we paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group, as set out below.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the Board of Management made important judgments, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and consider-\n\ning future events that are inherently uncertain. In Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, the Company describes areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement in the valuation of the post-retirement benefit provisions and the accounting for and valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, we considered these matters as key audit matters as set out in the section  'Key audit matters' of this report.\n\nThe Company continued the transformation programs under the 'Winning together: 15 by 20' strategy, which include centralization of finance activities in global business service hubs and simplification of the information technology (IT) environment, impacting the company's systems, processes and controls. Inherently transformation processes have the potential to disrupt the organization, processes and culture. We therefore extended our audit procedures during the planning phase of our audit, in order to evaluate the impact of the transformation. Due to the significance of the transformation to the Company and the extended audit procedures, we included the transformation as a key audit matter, as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report.\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic and related government restriction measures affected the Company's production and distribution, caused changes in sales volumes and product mix, and required staff to work from home. We considered the impact of the pandemic on our audit approach, including our scoping, materiality, and risk assessment. We concluded this to be an area of focus, that is not considered as a key audit matter. In particular we assessed the impact on significant management accounting judgments, including future business and cash flow projections underpinning impairment assessments, deferred tax asset recoverability and the going concern assumption. We also considered the risk of fraud inherent to increased remote working. In terms of the execution of our audit, we considered the impact of the travel and other restrictions on our audit and on the review and supervision of our teams. Our teams globally largely worked remotely and digitally, supported by video-meetings and PwC's digital tooling. We increased the frequency of communication between the Group and component PwC teams, including additional joint meetings with Group and compo-",

        "page_content": "nent management. While maintaining compliance with local health regulations, we performed sufficient physical checks of inventory and documents.\n\nOther areas of focus, that were not considered as key audit matters, were related to the impairment testing of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives, testing of valuation of the other provisions and information technology general controls (ITGCs). The ITGCs are the policies and procedures used by the Company to ensure IT operates as intended and provides reliable data for financial reporting purposes.\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams at both group and component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of the Group. We therefore included in our team experts in the areas of pensions, share based payments and valuations and specialists in the areas of tax, IT and treasury.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the section\n\n## The outline of our audit approach was as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\nOverall materiality: \u20ac45 million (2019: \u20ac39 million).\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u00b7  We conducted audit work at 50 components in 18 countries.\n- \u00b7  Site reviews were virtually conducted to 9 countries (34 components).\n- \u00b7  Audit coverage: 65% of consolidated revenue, 72% of consolidated total assets and 68% of consolidated profit before tax.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7  Transformation to deliver towards the 'Winning together: 15 by 20' strategy\n- \u00b7  Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions\n- \u00b7  Valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.\n\n## 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements'.\n\nBased on our professional judgment we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and on our opinion.\n\nWe also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgment, are material for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u20ac2 million (2019: \u20ac1.5 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Materiality\n\n| Overall group materiality          | \u20ac45 million (2019: \u20ac39 million).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basis for determining  materiality | We used our professional judgment to  determine overall materiality. As a basis for  our judgment we used 5% of total profit  before tax                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Rationale for bench- mark applied  | We used profit before tax as the primary  benchmark, a generally accepted auditing  practice, based on our analysis of the  common information needs of users of  the financial statements. On this basis, we  believe that profit before tax is an important  metric for the financial performance of the  Company. |\n| Component materiality              | To each component in our audit scope, we,  based on our judgment, allocate materiality  that is less than our overall group materiality.  The range of materiality allocated across  components was between \u20ac7 million and  \u20ac38 million.                                                                             |\n\n## The scope of our group audit\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities managed by the Board of Management and Executive Committee. The financial information of this Group is included in the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.\n\nThe group audit included 24 components which were subjected to audits of their complete financial information, selected on the basis of the relative size of their operations. None of the components are individually significant to the group. We further subjected 13 components to specific risk-focused audit procedures as they include significant or higher risk areas. Additionally, we selected 13 components for audit procedures to achieve appropriate coverage on financial line items in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:\n\n|                   | 2020   |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Revenue           | 65%    |\n| Total assets      | 72%    |\n| Profit before tax | 68%    |\n\nNone of the remaining components represented more than 2% of total group revenue, total group assets or profit before tax. For those remaining components we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within those components.\n\nFor all components we used component auditors who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform",

        "page_content": "the audit work. We collectively performed hard close audit procedures on the interim October balance sheet positions and results. These hard close audit procedures included substantive audit work on certain material balances and transactions. Roll-forward procedures and top-up testing were performed at year-end to cover the full year period.\n\nWhere component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the Consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe issued instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included amongst others our risk analysis, materiality and scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified, the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We had individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams throughout the audit. During these calls, we discussed the significant accounting and audit matters identified by the component auditors, their reports, the findings of their procedures and other matters which could be of relevance for the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe group engagement team virtually attended site review meetings with a selection of the component teams and local management. During these meetings we discussed the strategy and financial performance of the local businesses, as well as the audit plan and execution, significant risks and other relevant audit topics. The most significant components are selected every year and other components are selected depending on specific considerations which include, amongst others audit observations, specific risks identified and other major events. In view of developing a broader understanding of the local impact of the pandemic we increased the number of components covered compared to prior year. In the current year components in the following countries were selected: United States, China, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, South Korea, Turkey and the Netherlands.\n\nThe group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items and processes controlled\n\nand monitored centrally by Akzo Nobel N.V. These include impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, share-based payments, treasury, ITGCs and the Akzo Nobel N.V. standalone entity.\n\nThe group engagement team also performed central procedures over controls performed by the business units and other central functions, where relevant for our audit. This included indirect entity level controls (e.g. to prevent and detect fraud), including the code of conduct, corporate directives, whistle-blower policy, internal representations, business partnering program and internal audits.\n\nBy performing the procedures above at components, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group's financial information, as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Our focus on the risk of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nThe primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations lies with the Board of Management with the oversight of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption. We, together with our forensics specialists, evaluated the risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We conducted interviews with both members of the Board of Management, and with members of the Executive Committee, the Supervisory board and of others within the company to obtain an understanding the Company's fraud risk assessment and of the processes for identifying and responding to the risks of fraud and the internal control that management has established to mitigate these risks.\n\nIn addition, we performed procedures to obtain an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable for the Group. We identified provisions of those laws and regulations, generally recognized to have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements such as the financial reporting framework and tax and pension laws and regulations.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. The audit procedures to respond to the assessed risks include, amongst others, that we evaluated the design and the implementation of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks, retrospective review of prior year's estimates, procedures on unexpected journal entries with the support of data-analytics and we incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. In addition, we assessed matters reported on the Group's whistleblowing and complaints procedures and results of management's investigation of such matters if deemed applicable and discussed this with the Audit Committee.\n\nWe refer to the key audit matter 'Transformation to deliver towards the Winning together: 15 by 20 strategy' for the impact of the transformation on the risk of management override of internal controls. We refer to the key audit matters 'Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions' and 'Valuations of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions', that are examples of our approach related to areas of higher risk due to significant accounting estimates where management makes significant judgments.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## Our audit work and observations\n\n## Transformation to deliver towards the 'Winning together: 15 by 20 strategy'\n\nIn line with 2018 and 2019, the group continued its focus on transforming the company as part of management's three-year strategy 'Winning together: 15 by 20'. The transformation programs include further steps in centralization of finance activities in global business service hubs and simplification of the IT environment, impacting the Company's systems, processes and controls. Inherently, transformation processes have the potential to lead to a disruption of the organization, processes and culture.\n\nThe specific and ambitious external target of 15% ROS by 2020 inherently increases pressure on management to achieve such targets, and as such contributes to the risk of management override of internal controls risk, which is a presumed audit risk in our audit. This risk was partially mitigated by management's announcement in April 2020 of suspension of the financial target as a result of the uncertainty of the impact of the pandemic on AkzoNobel. The remuneration targets remained in place.\n\nIn addition, the planned increase in profitability of the company is expected to be reflected in management estimates, such as the forecasts used in the valuation of deferred tax assets and goodwill impairment analysis.\n\n## Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions\n\n## Note 19\n\nThe post-retirement benefit provisions consist of defined benefit obligations (\u20ac14.2 billion) more than offset by plan assets (\u20ac15.0 billion). The largest pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the AkzoNobel (CPS) Pension Scheme in the UK which together account for 86 percent of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and 91 percent of the plan assets.\n\nWe consider this to be a key audit matter because positions are significant to the company and the assessment process is complex and involves significant management judgment. The actuarial assumptions used include demographic assumptions (rates of employee turnover, disability, early retirement and mortality) and financial assumptions (discount rate, future salary, benefit increases/indexation and inflation), as disclosed in Note 19 of the Consolidated financial statements. Technical expertise is required to determine closing positions.\n\n## Valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions\n\n## Note 9\n\nThe Group operates globally and is therefore subject to income taxes in various tax jurisdictions. The assessment of the valuation of deferred tax assets, resulting from net operating losses, tax credits and temporary differences, and provisions for uncertain tax positions is significant to our audit as the positions are significant to the company, calculations are complex and depend on high estimation uncertainty and judgmental assumptions. The key assumptions include long-term projected revenue growth, savings supported by the transformation plans and programs, margin development and local fiscal regulations. The company's disclosures concerning income taxes are included in note 9 to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe extended our audit procedures to evaluate the impact of the transformation on systems, processes and controls. During the planning phase of our audit we updated our understanding of the transformation programs, as well as our understanding of the project governance, detailed timeline, scope of entities and processes of the transition of finance activities to global business service hubs. We held discussions directly with the different business service hubs in Poland, India, China and United States, in order to understand the status of the transition, understand the processes and controls in place to address the changes in the internal controls and evaluate the maturity of the processes. In order to obtain further evidence of the effectiveness of the controls in place, we also performed walkthroughs on selected controls in the business service hub in India. We used this information as part of our risk assessment procedures, determination of the scope of our audit and communication to our component teams.\n\nFor the simplification of the IT environment we involved our IT specialists. We obtained an understanding of the project governance and the validation approach and we tested the data migration. We used data analytics to identify unexpected journal entries.\n\nIn addition, for the testing of management's estimates, such as forecasts used in the valuation of deferred tax assets and goodwill impairment analysis, we validated the planned increase in profitability supported by, amongst others, approved plans and incurred costs savings.\n\nFrom the procedures performed, we did not have material findings with respect to the balance sheet positions and results recorded and disclosed.\n\nWith the assistance of our actuarial experts, we evaluated management's actuarial assumptions, the valuation methodologies applied, and we assessed the objectivity and competence of the company's external pension experts used for the calculation of the post-retirement benefit positions.\n\nWe have challenged management, primarily on their assumptions applied to which the post-retirement benefit provisions are the most sensitive, by performing independent testing over the assumptions and methodologies used and comparing to the published actuarial tables, amongst others, with support of our actuarial experts. We paid particular attention to the discount rate changes as described by the company in note 19, given the significance.\n\nWe also tested the participant census data and the valuation of the plan assets through independent price testing (e.g. by reconciling to independently published market prices).\n\nFurthermore, we tested the transactions as described in note 19 and we verified the appropriate accounting. We also assessed the adequacy of the company's disclosure in note 19 to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur procedures did not result in material findings with respect to the valuation and disclosure of post-retirement benefit provisions at December 31, 2020.\n\nWith respect to the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions we performed the following procedures with the assistance of our tax specialists:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested management's assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets, by challenging their key assumptions. We specifically focused on the development of the budget compared to the actual results, the impact of COVID-19 on the country results, the impact of the structural nature of (transformation) savings and the completeness of the future cost included in the forecasts compared to the current cost base.\n- \u00b7  We obtained an understanding and assessed completeness of the tax exposures and uncertain tax positions recognised, through discussions with group and local management. We evaluated the probability of future cash outflows related to the uncertain tax positions identified by the company.\n- \u00b7 We also assessed the applicable local fiscal regulations and developments, in particular those related to changes in the statutory income tax rate and the statutes of limitation, since these are key assumptions underlying the valuation of the deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. We analysed the tax positions and evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used.\n- \u00b7 In addition, we assessed the adequacy of the company's disclosures on deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions and assumptions used.\n\nOur procedures did not result in material findings with respect to the valuation of deferred tax assets, the uncertain tax positions recorded and related disclosures at December 31, 2020.\n\nmatters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.\n\nWe addressed the key audit matters in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide separate opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any comment or observation we",

Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Management.\n- \u00b7  Concluding on the appropriateness of the Board of Management's use of the going-concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on\n- the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nConsidering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the Consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or\n\nregulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

Amsterdam ('AkzoNobel' or 'the company'). Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected non-financial indicators in the annual report 2020 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with AkzoNobel's reporting criteria.\n\n## What we have reviewed\n\nThe object of our assurance engagement concerns selected non-financial indicators for the year ended December 31, 2020. The selected indicators are marked with the symbol (the 'indicators') in the annual report 2020 of Akzo Nobel N.V. (the 'annual report'), and are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Organizational health score\n- \u00b7  Female executives (in %)\n- \u00b7  Fatalities employees (number)\n- \u00b7  Fatalities contractors - temporary workers plus independent (number)\n- \u00b7  Lost time injury rate employees/temporary workers (per 200,000 hours worked)\n- \u00b7  Lost time injury rate contractors (per 200,000 hours worked)\n- \u00b7  Regulatory actions - Level 4 (number)\n- \u00b7  Total reportable injury rate employees/temporary workers (per 200,000 hours worked)\n- \u00b7  Total reportable injury rate contractors (per 200,000 hours worked)\n- \u00b7  Loss of primary containment - Level 1 (number)\n- \u00b7  Loss of primary containment - Level 2 (number)\n- \u00b7  Process safety event - Level 3 (number)\n- \u00b7  Occupational illness rate employees (per 1,000,000 hours worked)\n- \u00b7  Volatile organic compounds (in kilotons)\n- \u00b7  Volatile organic compounds (kg per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Energy use (in 1000 TJ)\n- \u00b7  Energy use (GJ per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Total waste (total kg per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Hazardous waste to landfill (in kilotons)\n- \u00b7  Hazardous waste to landfill (total kg per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Renewable energy - own operations (in %)\n- \u00b7  Renewable electricity - own operations (in %)\n- \u00b7  Greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2(e) per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Greenhouse gas emissions - direct CO2(e) emissions (Scope 1) (in million tons)\n- \u00b7  Greenhouse gas emissions - indirect CO2(e) emissions (Scope 2) (in million tons)\n- \u00b7  Greenhouse gas emissions - direct CO2(e) emissions (Scope 1) (total kg per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Greenhouse gas emissions - indirect CO2(e) emissions (Scope 2) (total kg per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Total waste - reusable (in kilotons)\n- \u00b7  Total waste - non-reusable (in kilotons)\n- \u00b7  Total non-reusable waste (total kg per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Fresh water use (in million M3)\n- \u00b7  Fresh water use (M3 per ton of production)\n- \u00b7  Scope 3 upstream (million tons)\n- \u00b7  Scope 3 downstream (million tons)\n- \u00b7  Cradle-to-grave carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2 and 3) (million tons)\n- \u00b7  Suppliers in sustainability program - in line with our expectation (in %)\n- \u00b7  Suppliers in sustainability program - under development (in %)\n- \u00b7  Suppliers participating in CSR program (in % against baseline)\n- \u00b7  Eco-premium solutions (in % of revenue)\n\n## The basis for our conclusion\n\nWe conducted our review in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standard 3000A 'Assurance engagements, other than audits or reviews of historical financial information (attestation-engagements)'. This engagement is aimed to provide limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities for the review' of our report.\n\nWe believe that the assurance information we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance\n\nwith the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct).\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for quality systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Applicable criteria\n\nThe indicators need to be read and understood in conjunction with the reporting criteria. The Board of Management of AkzoNobel is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting.\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Indicators are AkzoNobel's reporting criteria developed by the company, as disclosed in the 'Managing sustainability' paragraph of the annual report and further elaborated in The Reporting Principles 2020 which were made available online* www.akzonobel.com/en/about-us/sustainability-/ reporting-principles-. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.",

The procedures performed in this context consisted primarily of making inquiries with officers of the entity and determining the plausibility of the information included in the indicators. The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nMisstatements may arise due to fraud or error.

This includes the evaluation of the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the review in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control\n- \u00b7  Identifying areas with a higher risk of material misstatement within the indicators, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. These procedures consisted, among others, of:\n- - Interviewing management (and/or relevant staff) responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results\n- - Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data in the indicators\n- - Determining the nature and extent of the review procedures for the group components and locations. For this, the nature, extent and/or risk profile of these components are decisive. Based thereon we selected the components and locations to visit. We have performed remote review procedures in Turkey to validate our understanding of local processes. In addition, during our procedures in Turkey we also validated source data and evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls and validation procedures\n- - Obtaining assurance evidence that the indicators reconcile with underlying records of the company\n- - Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation\n- - Performing an analytical review of the data and trends in the information submitted for consolidation at corporate level\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the consistency of the indicators with the information in the annual report, which is not included in the scope of our review\n- \u00b7  To consider whether the indicators as a whole, including the disclosures, reflect the purpose of the reporting criteria used\n\nWe communicated with the Supervisory Board and Board of Management on the planned scope and timing of the engagement and on the significant findings that result from our engagement.\n\nAmsterdam, February 16, 2021\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.\n\nOriginal has been signed by Fernand Izeboud RA",
