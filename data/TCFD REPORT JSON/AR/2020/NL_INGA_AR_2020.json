This report describes how we live up to our purpose and create value as a bank, as an employer and in society.

The net result was heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the current environment, however, our digital business model continues to be a clear advantage as we added another 578,000 primary retail customers in 2020, while mobile interactions further increased.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Return on equity ING Group\n\n4.8%\n\n## Addition to loan loss provision\n\n+139%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nING Group's RoE was 4.8% compared to 9.4% in 2019. ING's return on equity is calculated using IFRS-EU shareholders' equity after excluding 'reserved profit not included in CET1 capital'. The 2020 ROE was affected by several sizeable negative incidentals in the P&L as well as IFRS 9 provisioning, other Covid-19 related effects, negative rates, regulatory impacts on RWA and a CET1 ratio well above our long-term ambition.\n\nRisk costs increased to \u20ac2,675 million in 2020, or 43 bp s of average customer lending (which is above ING's through-the-cycle average of ~25 bps). Approximately 30% of the 2020 risk costs were Stage 1 and Stage 2, mainly due to Covid-19, reflecting IFRS 9-related provisioning based on macroeconomic scenarios, management overlays to reflect a delay in observed defaults that are still expected and close monitoring of the loan book. The quality of the loan book is strong with a Stage 3 ratio of 1.7%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CET1 ratio ING Group\n\n15.5%\n\n## Cost/income ratio\n\n63.2%\n\nThe CET1 ratio strengthened to 15.5% from 14.6% at year-end 2019, due to lower RWA and is well above our CET1 ratio ambition of around 12.5%. Total RWA decreased by \u20ac20 billion to \u20ac306 billion, mainly due to currency impacts, lower lending volumes and a better overall profile of the loan book. CET1 capital was slightly lower at \u20ac47.3 billion.\n\nThe cost/income ratio increased to 63.2% from 56.6% in 2019, as expenses rose 7.7% (mainly due To several incidental items, including impairments and restructuring provisions, and higher regulatory costs), while income declined 3.7% (partly due to an impairment on our equity stake in TMB). Excluding regulatory costs and these incidental items, the 2020 cost/income ratio was 52.5%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe result before tax declined 44% to \u20ac3.8 billion in 2020. This was mainly caused by higher risk costs and higher expenses (largely caused by incidental costs due to restructuring provisions and impairments). Although fee income increased, total income declined mainly due to margin pressure on liabilities and an impairment on our equity stake in TMB. Net core lending fell by \u20ac2.5 billion in 2020, while net customer deposits grew by \u20ac41.4 billion.",

CEO Steven van Rijswijk reflects on ING's performance and developments in digitalisation, innovation and sustainability, while considering a year in which our digital model was put to the test.\n\n## Steven, let's start with the obvious question, how do you look back on coronavirusdominated 2020?\n\nThe global pandemic indeed cast its shadow over the whole year, and it continues to do so -although we see light on the horizon with the start of mass vaccination programmes in many countries. Each and every one of us has been affected in some way by the coronavirus. It has placed all of us under a lot of pressure, both personally and professionally. Even so, there are positives I'm able to take from this situation.\n\nIt has given us further opportunities to live up to our purpose of empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. For example, by helping out people in need in the societies in which we are active -from donating computer equipment so that children could continue their education remotely to making our real estate available as extra hospital capacity if needed. Since the start of the pandemic, ING has raised and donated millions through initiatives in 25 countries, as well as contributing more than \u20ac2 million to UNICEF's global coronavirus appeal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > In conversation with our CEO\n\nWe also see this crisis as an opportunity to build back a better world . It's encouraging to see governments and businesses take ownership and define new ways of doing business that align economic recovery with positive environmental and social impact. I'm hopeful this mark s a turning point for sustainable growth going forward. We have been supporting a number of projects that focus on longer-term economic recovery -by developing digital skills, promoting social entrepreneurship and providing financial health education. Financial health, together with climate action, is the focus of our sustainability direction. We want to create a healthy planet with prosperous people.\n\nWe have reached out pro-actively to many of our clients, staying closely connected and having regular conversations to see how they're doing and to understand how their business models are holding up to the new challenges they're facing. We've been there to advise and support, and have also provide d a tangible helping hand through payment holidays totalling \u20ac 19.4 billion to around 196,000 customers, as well as giving prudent financial support to business customers facing liquidity issues.\n\n## You've covered customers and communities. How did we support ING colleagues through this challenging period?\n\nThe health and safety of our colleagues was top of mind for me and my fellow Board members throughout the year, and continues to be so. We kept a close eye on the wellbeing of our workforce through regular 'pulse' surveys, supplemented by informal check -ins by managers with their teams. ING employees also received assistance in setting up suitable workspaces in their home 'offices', and online wellbeing information and tools were distributed to all. This included specific resources aimed at supporting parents with their home-schooling responsibilities.\n\nThe way our people held up during very challenging circumstances, continuing to deliver for our customers, has been fantastic. Seeing examples of our Orange Code in action every day -with colleagues supporting one another and helping each other to be successful - has been a source of pride for me and my colleagues in the Management Board Banking.\n\nAnd we continued to serve our customers with a mostly virtual workforce, as on average 80 percent of our global workforce was working from home since mid-March. The speed with which we were able to move over to a remote-working model was truly impressive and is testament to our digital model and solid Tech foundation.\n\nWe are now applying learnings from this to design a way of working best suited to the 'new normal' of a post -Covid-19 world, with the health and safety of colleagues still our top priority. We have created global guiding principles that aim to balance the advantages of working from home and working from the office. We will test and pilot these guiding principles in several countries when local health guidelines allow, taking a step-by-step approach that provides flexibility in implementation and respects local labour laws.\n\n## What about ING's performance?\n\nThe economic situation of course impacts our results. It affects our customers, and it therefore affects us. The economic damage we expect from the pandemic is reflected in the forward-looking loan loss provisions we took in 2020. It is also likely the very low interest rate environment is here to stay for the foreseeable future. This has meant continued pressure on our net interest income, exacerbated by weakened demand for consumer and business loans in a number of markets. Yet our results remained resilient throughout the year. We managed to further diversify our income, with good fee growth. In particular we saw strong results in investment products for retail customers, who turned to our accessible digital investment solutions in greater numbers during the pandemic, reinforcing our position in the mobile and online banking space. And we ended the year with improving cost control and a strong capital position.\n\nWe also announced a new capital plan and dividend policy. Our new long-term CET1 ratio ambition level of around 12.5 percent translates into an approximate 200 bps buffer over current minimum regulatory requirements, and while Covid-19-related uncertainties remain we will maintain our CET1 ratio well above this ambition level. The new dividend policy is a 50 percent pay-out ratio over resilient net profit, to be distributed in the form of cash or a combination of cash and share repurchases. However, we continue to comply with the European Central Bank's r ecommendations on shareholder distributions, and in line with these we paid an interim cash dividend of \u20ac0.12 per share after publishing our 4Q2020 results. Further distributions are intended after end-September 2021, as per the current ECB guidance.\n\n## What stands out for you in terms of non-financial measures of success?\n\nI'm particularly pleased with the growth of primary customer relationships. Over the course of the year we saw our retail primary customers total grow by 578,000 to 13.9 million.",

        "page_content": "- > In conversation with our CEO\n\nAnd with safety of our customers paramount, we empowered them to do their banking and payments at a distance with our digital and contactless solutions. Mobile card payment volumes more than doubled compared to 2019, and 40 percent of active customers only interact with us using the mobile app.\n\nCustomers seem to appreciate the ING experience, with ING ranked as the number one bank in six of our 14 retail countries and a top-three position in 12 countries, as measured by the Net Promoter Score (NPS). In Wholesale Banking our NPS over the course of 2020 was 13 percent higher than the industry average.\n\nThese achievements highlight the ongoing relevance of our mobile-first digital strategy, which has been given a boost by the accelerated digitalisation of society resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. To keep pace with the growing demand for mobile banking we're now taking steps to build on the foundation we've laid over the past years and further improve the digital customer experience end to end.\n\n## ING has been undergoing a transformation these past few years, with the stated aim of ' delivering a differentiating customer experience ' that is mobile-first and consistent. Are you satisfied with further implementation of the Think Forward strategy in 2020?\n\nOur purpose can be considered the 'why' of what we do, with our Think Forward strategy as the 'what'. My focus since becoming CEO is on the 'how' and 'where' of our strategy implementation. I want to steer ING to deliver on our strategic priorities with more certainty on execution delivery.\n\nThe increased focus on execution resulted in recent changes to the geographical footprint of our Wholesale Banking business line, with the announced closure of offices in South America and some in Asia. We continue to serve the international needs of clients in those countries from our regional hubs in New York, Singapore and Hong Kong. Alongside the simplification of our footprint, we also decided to concentrate our efforts on a streamlined number of core clients.\n\nIn addition, we stopped our Maggie transformation programme (formerly Model Bank), which was launched in late 2016 to integrate the product offering and provide a standardised easy, personal and smart digital experience for customers in four of our Challenger markets. Given the coronavirus-related economic headwinds and our learnings from the complexities and costs of cross-border system and product integration, we instead decided to further develop our universal digital bank by focusing on the global use of ING's technology foundation, the re -use where possible of already-developed mobile app components, and the rollout of global digital product offerings in the areas of insurance, investments and consumer lending.\n\nThese decisions will regrettably impact approximately 1,000 of our colleagues, mainly over the course of 2021.\n\n## You've stressed that data and digitalisation are your two main focus areas when it comes to executing the Think Forward strategy. Did we make progress in these specific areas?\n\nThe number one priority for ING is to ensure that we are safe, secure and compliant. Data and end-toend digitalisation are key to our non-financial risk and know your customer enhancement efforts, and in 2020 we joined forces with four other Dutch banks to monitor transactions in the Netherlands in the collective fight against money laundering. We also stepped up our KYC training with an internationally recognised certification and connected all ING countries in scope to our digital pre-screening transaction tool as part of our standardisation efforts.\n\nBeing data-driven will bring many benefits for our customers and our organisation. At the same time, the basics need to be right, and so the focus in 2020 has been on further improving data quality and data accessibility, which means getting goodquality data properly 'ingested' into our shared data lakes. We now have the right governance in place, and we continue to work on the process, with the ambition to be 'dat adriven by design'. Part of this is, of course, data safety and security, ensuring that our own data and that entrusted to us by our customers, is secure and protected from loss, misuse or theft. These improvements are helping us to deliver on our external regulatory commitments.",

In 2020, we made further progress in building out our global digital solutions in the areas of insurance and investments, with digital investment products in particular contributing to growth in fee income, especially in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Another example I'd like to highlight is also in Belgium, where all private individual customers can now use our OneWeb online banking solution and the mobile OneApp also used (and highly rated) in Germany and the Netherlands.\n\n## Increasing the pace of innovation is another one of Think Forward's priorities. Did we succeed in speeding innovation up in 2020?\n\nThere's another innovation -related priority as well, and that's to 'think beyond traditional banking' by developing new services and business models. So yes, innovation remains a key component of our strategy, not only in improving the customer experience but also in supporting our income diversification and cost-containment goals.\n\nTo help make sure that our innovation efforts deliver tangible value at an increased pace, we'll focus our efforts on solutions that either improve the customer experience or improve ING's own internal processes and way of working. To support this more-focused approach, as of the beginning of 2021 we have brought all innovation initiatives under a new business area, ING Neo.\n\nIn 2020, we introduced several new innovative services such as CoorpID and Blacksmith, two solutions that digitalise the know your customer process for our corporate clients, and Dealwise, a shopping platform that offers cashback deals and discounts to consumers. We gave our innovation culture a boost by reintroducing the Innovation Bootcamp where employees can develop their innovative ideas into tangible products and services.\n\n## The coronavirus pandemic has ar guably diverted the world's attention away from a very pressing problem -that of climate change. How did ING contribute in 2020 to building back a better world?\n\nAlthough the coronavirus did indeed consume much of our attention, we pressed on with our sustainability efforts. I believe that ING is already a sustainability leader in the financial sector,\n\nespecially when it comes to climate action and the contribution to a low-carbon society. That view is confirmed by the external recognition we get for our environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) profile from independent research and ratings providers such as Sustainalytics, S&P Global and MSCI, which upgraded us to 'AA' .\n\nWe play a role by financing change, sharing knowledge and using our influence to encourage the transition of clients and peers to more sustainable business models. We continued to align our lending portfolio with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, guided by our Terra approach, which now covers nine carbon-intensive sectors most responsible for climate change. Terra helps us to put our technology expertise to work in combatting climate change, by assessing the sector-by-sector technology shift necessary to slow global warming and then measuring this against the actual technology clients are using -or plan on using in the future. We then advise on, support and finance the transitions clients need to make to their business models to ensure a sustainable future. And in 2020 we supported 33 sustainability improvement loans and 60 green, social and sustainability bonds. This funding supports projects that advance renewable energy solutions, low-carbon buildings, lowcarbon transport and the circular economy, for example.\n\n## You were appointed as CEO half-way through 2020, after serving on the board as chief risk officer. How have you experienced your change in role?\n\nI was humbled to be offered the role of CEO. I have worked for ING for most of my professional life, and it is truly an honour to lead this company now and into the future. It was of course challenging to take up the role in the midst of a global pandemic and its resulting economic crisis, but I did it knowing that I could rely on the support and guidance of our Supervisory Board and my colleagues in the Man agement Board Banking, and with full confidence in ING's strategic direction and in the capabilities and commitment of colleagues all over the ING world.\n\nI'd like to pay tribute to my predecessor Ralph Hamers, whose vision has put us on our strategic path -a digital and mobile-first path whose relevance was further confirmed in 2020. Ralph also led us through the first few months of the pandemic, overseeing our successful switch to a 'work from home' model.\n\nI aim to continue his good work by giving the organisation further focus so that we execute our Think Forward strategy with certainty, continuing our transformation into a leading universal data-driven digital bank.",

The biggest of these in 2020 was the coronavirus pandemic, which was an unprecedented public health challenge and which also caused devastating economic and social disruption.\n\nING has had to adapt to the implications this had for customers and employees, as well as to new market trends and stakeholder expectations. At the same time, our business continues to be affected by regulatory changes and the persistent low interest rate environment. Our coronavirus response aims to offer short-term relief as well as deliver long-term value for our stakeholders and society. Read more in ' How we make a difference ' .\n\nTo improve as an organisation we need to identify, understand and closely manage our performance on the most important topics for our stakeholders, balancing their interest whenever we make decisions. That's why we engage with our internal and external stakeholders in various ways. We also constantly monitor external shifts in regulatory developments and market trends. Both of these give insight into which topics are most important for which stakeholders, and how these topics relate to our business. Our annual materiality assessment then helps us identify which economic, environmental and social topics we should focus on. These are highlighted in this report.\n\nThis chapter will address some of the material topics as well as other important themes and developments in 2020: the Covid-19 pandemic, macroeconomic developments, climate change, financial crime risks, cybersecurity resilience, personal data protection, and culture and ethics.\n\n## Material topics 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomer privacy and information security\n\nSystem availability\n\nDigitalisation and interconnectivity\n\nEmployee development\n\nCulture, ethics and integrity\n\nCybercrime resilience\n\nFinancial performance\n\nCustomer experience\n\nClimate resilience\n\nThe materiality assessment is subject to reasonable assurance by KPMG.

National and local governments across the world introduced measures aimed at preventing the further spread of the virus. These included the closure of schools, sports facilities, bars and restaurants; bans on public events; and travel restrictions and border controls. Such measures disrupted the normal flow of business operations in most countries, including those where ING operates. It affected global supply chains, manufacturing, tourism, consumer spending and asset prices, and has increased volatility and uncertainty across the global economy and in financial markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInnovation\n\nEnvironmental and social risk management",

        "page_content": "- > World around us\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the economic consequences, governments introduced measures to protect households and companies. These included tax-payment holidays, guarantee schemes and compensation for heavily affected sectors in the economy. Still, the economic consequences had -and may continue to have -a significant impact on ING's customers, employee s, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThere were also regulatory developments in light of Covid-19. The European and other central banks took steps to help by relaxing rules on capital buffers that banks need to hold and made recommendations on paying dividends, which remain in effect until at least September 2021. This gives banks more buffer capital available to lend to businesses during coronavirus restrictions, and to absorb losses when businesses can't repay those loans. The European Central Bank (ECB) also undertook various monetary policy measures to provide liquidity to the economy and banks in particular. See more in ' Our p erformance' .\n\nING also took steps to protect and provide relief for our customers, employees and communities. For example, we offered customers payment holidays and provided business clients with liquidity. Read more in 'Our business' . We worked hard to safeguard the wellbeing of our employees. We built on our digital foundation and equipped employees with the necessary facilities to work from home without interrupting the high standards of service we offer customers. Read more in ' Our people ' . For communities, we encouraged our businesses and employees to donate time and funds to help address the initial challenges the coronavirus brought, as well as looking towards the future and how we can help build back better. Read more in 'How we make a difference' .\n\n## Macroeconomic developments\n\nAs a global financial services company, our profitability, solvency and liquidity are influenced by the state of the economy and the market environment for business, liquidity, funding and capital. The year's volatility had a marked impact on our performance.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic threw the world economy into turmoil. The global economy shrank in 2020 as demand and supply, trade, and finance were severely disrupted. Although we started to see a recovery mid-year as lockdowns were relaxed, a second wave of the virus caused governments to slow reopening and/or re-impose lockdowns, and the economic recovery lost momentum. In most advanced economies, despite effective monetary and fiscal policy support, output remained substantially below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWestern European economies were hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and associated mobilityreducing measures. In Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, economic activity in the first half of 2020 dropped by 10-15%. Economic activity in the second quarter of 2020 recorded the largest contractions since World War II.\n\nFollowing a rapid implementation of sizeable policy support measures and after most economic activities were allowed to resume (subject to social distancing and hygiene measures), the economic environment turned more favourable during the summer. However, despite a strong economic rebound in the third quarter, the level of economic activity at the end of the year was still below yearend 2019 levels as a resurgence of new coronavirus cases necessitated the re-imposition of lockdown measures.\n\nHelped by job retention schemes, the rise in unemployment was relatively mild and levelled off in the second half of the year. Despite the unemployment rate having increased, housing markets remained firm, helped by interest rates remaining low.\n\nThere was an asymmetric impact across the euro area, with southern countries (Spain, Italy) generally hit the hardest during the first wave of the coronavirus. This was partly due to the variation in the length and strictness of containment measures, the size of discretionary fiscal support, and differences in the economic importance of international tourism.\n\nAs in the eurozone, economic performance in Poland was heavily influenced by lockdown measures, the introduction of job protection schemes and increased public expenditure. Uncertainty about domestic factors and the economic recovery held back private investment, as in most other European countries. The central bank of Poland reduced the benchmark interest rate to 0.1% and purchased assets in the secondary market to improve banks' liquidity.",

To help ING's leadership in their strategic planning, we developed scenarios for various potential outcomes to these developments so we are better prepared for different possible futures. The ongoing negative interest rate environment is also making it a priority for ING to diversify our income.\n\nLarge amounts of fiscal stimulus deployed by governments worldwide in 2020 were combined with monetary stimulus. The US Federal Reserve lowered key interest rates and the ECB stepped up bond purchasing. In the eurozone, the yield curve flattened. In general, the euro appreciated compared with its main trading partners, reflecting perceived changes in global risk sentiment and interest rate developments. Towards the end of the year, positive news about vaccines improved financial market sentiment, although a strong eruption of new coronavirus cases and the emergence of new, more contagious variants are sobering the economic outlook.\n\nUncertainty around the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom continued throughout the year, compounding the impact of Covid-19, which weakened the British pound vis-\u00e0vis the euro. In July, we announced that due to Brexit we will move ING's European trading activities from London to Amsterdam. The successful conclusion of an EU/UK-trade deal at year-end avoided economic disruption at the start of 2021.\n\nChina regained control of the outbreak of the coronavirus relatively swiftly by implementing strict sanitary and economic measures, and in the second half of the year almost all activities had restarted and exceeded pre-pandemic levels. However, the number of cases began increasing again towards the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021.\n\nAustralia was hit less severely by the coronavirus pandemic than other countries. The Australian authorities introduced considerable fiscal and monetary support to the economy. The central bank reduced its policy rate and three-year Australian government bond yield target to 0.1% and extended its long-term, low-cost funding to banks to boost business loans. The central bank also introduced an asset purchase programme targeted at long-term bonds to ease further financial conditions.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is one of the world's most urgent problems. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it will have a potentially catastrophic environmental, human and economic toll if left unaddressed. We believe that ING can make the biggest impact in fighting climate change through our financing.\n\nWe work with our clients to finance and facilitate their transition to lowcarbon technologies. We've developed a comprehensive suite of sustainability products and services to help them, including green loans and green bonds. Read more in 'Our business' .\n\nWith our Terra approach, we aim to align our loan book with the Paris Agreement's well -below twodegrees Celsius goal in the nine sectors most responsible for climate change. In 2020, we released our second Terra progress report. The report includes quantitative results and targets for all of these nine sectors, fulfilling the commitment we made the previous year. One of these targets is a 19% reduction in our financing to upstream oil and gas by 2040 compared with 2019 levels . It's important to note that this target is in line with the International Energy Association's sustainable development scenario, and that it's not static. If mo re or quicker action is needed and the scenario is adjusted, our target will adjust accordingly. For more details on our targets and exposure in these nine sectors, please see the latest Terra progress report on ing.com.\n\nOur approach to climate action is collaborative and inclusive. We helped develop an open-source climate methodology with our partner, the 2\u02da Investing Initiative (2DII). This was published in 2020 for all banks to use. We're working with other banks to make this an industry -wide standard, as we believe this will lead to greater transparency and help the financial sector make a bigger impact. In December 2018, ING and four peers signed the Katowice Commitment and in September 2020 these same banks published a blueprint of how we 'll all use the methodology developed with 2DII.",

        "page_content": "- > World around us\n\nOur work with the Katowice Commitment laid the groundwork for the Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA) , now signed by 38 banks globally. This is the banking sector's farthest -reaching commitment to climate alignment. ING is co-lead of the implementation of the CCCA. In December 2020 an overview was published of the concrete measures CCCA signatory banks took in the first 12 months to deliver on their commitment. ING is a founding signatory of the Principles for Responsible Banking, adopted by more than 200 banks, representing a third of the world's banking assets.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the 'UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking' section of the Non-financial appendix at the back of this report.\n\nWhile our Terra approach helps measure the impact of our loans on the climate, we are increasingly aware of the risks associated with climate change. These include physical risks, which can be acute (such as floods and wildfires) or chronic (temperature increases and rising sea levels); and transition risk, which is driven by policy, technology or market changes as we shift towards a low-carbon global economy and potentially lead to stranded assets. Our climate risk programme helps measure the impact of climate change on our loan book. Following a year of floods, droughts and wildfires, climaterelated risk again topped the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 2020 global risk ranking in terms of likelihood of occurrence and impact. The IMF is examining the impact of climate on the world's financial markets and whether it is priced into market valuations. The European Central Bank (ECB) published a guide in 2020 on how they expect banks to prudently manage and transparently disclose climaterelated and environmental risks under current prudential rules.\n\nWe are continuing to advance our understanding and approach to climate risks and opportunities. In 2020 ING published our first Climate Risk Report, setting out our approach to managing this emerging strategic and credit risk. We're integrating climate risk into our risk management framework, governance and business strategy. Please see the Environmental, social and governance risk chapter for more information.\n\n## Financial crime risks\n\nMoney laundering is a crime in and of itself. It also facilitates other crimes, such as people trafficking and drug smuggling. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, suspicious transactions continue to reach as much as $2 trillion a year. This scale illustrates the scope of the problem -it is not something one bank can fight on its own.\n\nTo be more effective in our efforts to fight financial economic crime, we work closely with our peers, regulators and law enforcement. This includes initiatives with other Dutch and Belgian banks to jointly monitor transactions, and further professionalising our KYC organisation by means of internationally recognised certifications.\n\nNext to this, improving customer due diligence and transaction monitoring activities are top priorities for ING. Since 2017 , we've been running a programme to enhance our know your customer activities in all customer segments of all ING business units. This has led to standardised KYC policies, global governance and consistent processes, tools and training, which contribute to becoming sustainably better in the way we address money laundering risks and comply with laws and regulations.\n\nStructural solutions include interventions aimed at addressing undesirable behavioural patterns identified within the organisation and encouraging desirable behaviours that will positively influence KYC execution. Read more in 'How we make a difference' and 'Risk management'.\n\n## Cybersecurity resilience\n\nDigital technology has connected the world in an unprecedented way. The Covid-19 outbreak highlighted just how much people rely on the internet to work, socialise and shop. At the same time, there are growing concerns about unequal access, a lack of governance, data privacy and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.",

        "page_content": "- > World around us\n\nCybercrime is a growing threat to companies in general and to the financial system in particular. The expansion of mobile and online banking, and ING's own reliance on cloud technology especially at a time when many employees are working from home -have increased the risk of criminals gaining unauthorised access to ING networks. The global lockdowns due to the pandemic also presented opportunities for criminals to continue to target customers with phishing attacks, identity theft and online fraud.\n\nOne of our top priorities is to keep our bank safe, secure and compliant and to retain customers ' trust . Our multi-faceted approach aims to anticipate threats and prevent them from becoming reality. Safeguards include security and communication-monitoring capabilities that use behavioural analysis, machine learning and rules engines. We are also partnering with fintechs and others to facilitate security innovation for the bank and our industry. Read more in 'How we make a difference' .\n\n## Personal data protection\n\nAlong with cybersecurity, safeguarding customer data and data privacy are also important responsibilities. This is required by an increasing legislative focus, for example through the EU's second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It requires financial institutions to walk the fine line between privacy protection and fostering data sharing.\n\nAn ING International Survey released in October 2020 found that while open banking -the sharing of financial data between service providers with the user's permission is providing more tools that make people's financial lives ea sier, not everyone is using them. Carried out in 13 European countries, the survey revealed differing attitudes to sharing personal data and interacting with technology. In Austria and Germany, for example, around two-thirds of people were happy for companies to share their information with their consent. In the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech Republic, this was only around one in 10 people.\n\nThere are also different attitudes to security around accessing data. This could range from simple passwords to voice, face and fingerprint recognition or a combination. The value of the global fingerprint-sensor market, for example, is expected to rise to $5.2 billion in 2026 from $2.9 billion today, according to market research. This is partly as a result of the increasing numbers of smartphones, tablets and wearable devices. Yet the survey found that just about a third of Europeans think fingerprint logins are 'very secure'.\n\nOur customers trust us with their money and their data, a responsibility we take very seriously. This is supported by our global data protection policy (GDPP), which is aligned with the EU 's general data protection regulation. Our global and local data ethics councils guide our decisions around the use of data, based on ING's Orange Code values. Read more in 'How we make a difference' .\n\n## Culture and ethics\n\nTrust in the financial sector has been rising since the financial crisis of 2008/2009 and rose in the first half of 2020 according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, driven by banks' response to the Covid -19 outbreak. ING adheres to a comprehensive set of policies and rules designed to protect our customers and our bank from conduct that will jeopardise people's trust in our business and our sector. Th is includes policies to prevent insider trading, price-fixing and market manipulation, as well as regulations to detect and prevent tax evasion, fraud and financial crime.\n\nTrust is about more than regulatory compliance and internal controls that ensure a company sticks to the rules. It's built on the values and behaviours the company exhibits. ING's Orange Code places integrity above all else. It defines the principles we stick to no matter what and the behaviours we are committed to. Our Orange Code also guides our decisions when we're faced with dilemmas. In addition, all ING employees are expected to adhere to our global Code of Conduct. Introduced at the start of 2020, it builds on our Orange Code, giving employees tangible guidance on how to put it into practice. The global Code of Conduct is in addition to local codes of conduct in various countries.\n\nWe will not ignore, tolerate or excuse behaviour that breaches our values. We encourage employees to speak up against discrimination and strive to create a diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone feels free to be themselves. Read more in 'Our people' .",

We do that by providing our clients with finance and insights to support them in their transition. And through the projects and sectors we choose to finance -or not, like coal. Throughout my career I've been involved in sustainability. In 2015, I joined ING's global Sustainability team where I built up the environmental programme. I was in the right place at the right time. When the Paris Agreement was signed, it became clear to me that financing is crucial to achieving climate goals and that the financial sector needed to get more involved. Measurement is key to achieving the Terra objectives. Much of my team's work is focused on understanding the impact of our portfolio in relation to climate goals and what data we need to analyse how our financing relates to those goals. Our influence goes beyond ING and its clients. Our financial institutions clients have come to us to say they're really interested in learning from what we've done.

With our data-driven digital and mobilefirst approach we're continuing to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business -also at a time of social and economic disruption. The global coronavirus pandemic has illustrated just how digital society has become, reinforcing trends like the shift to mobile banking and contactless payments.\n\nDelivering on our strategy is about living up to our customer promise to be clear and easy, anytime, anywhere, empowering and keep getting better. Digitalisation remains central to this and we're adapting our processes and service models to make banking even safer, more personal, easier and smarter. Combined with mastering data, it's how we can stand out as a bank that truly knows its customers and anticipates their evolving needs, finding innovative ways to add value, both within and beyond banking.\n\nW e're doing all of this while striving to live up to the highest possible standards of integrity. Being a safe, secure and compliant bank remains a top priority for ING. Our Orange Code of values and behaviours places integrity above all else.\n\n## Factors influencing our business in 2020\n\nThe spread of Covid-19, and the global measures to contain it, affected ING in a number of ways in 2020, impacting our customers, our employees and our communities. However, it was not the only factor influencing our business. The negative interest rate environment in the eurozone and low interest rates elsewhere, have posed a significant challenge to banks' business models since 2016, eroding margins on customer deposits and putting pressure on net interest income. Until 2020, we were able to counter the effects of this mainly through profitable lending growth and a presence in non-eurozone countries.\n\nHowever, the pandemic made these levers less effective in 2020, resulting in a decrease of net interest income, as loan demand weakened in a number of markets due to strong direct government support, while the inflow of customer deposits accelerated and interest rates in non-eurozone countries significantly reduced. In response to the pressure on net interest income we introduced negative interest rates on deposits for retail customers in some markets and amplified our focus on income diversification through fee income growth, particularly in retail investment products.\n\nThat said, the impact of the global pandemic is still reverberating through societies worldwide. The second wave that surged through Europe and the US in the autumn continued to pile pressure on consumers, businesses, communities and economies. It has fundamentally changed the way people work, travel, shop and socialise and the expected economic consequences will be felt for some time yet. We are considering various post-coronavirus scenarios focused on the next two to five years that take account of the severity of the economic downturn and level of global cooperation in the recovery period.\n\n## Universal digital bank\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has accelerated the urgency of implementing end-to-end digitalisation, both to meet the growing demand for mobile banking and to enhance operational excellence. Operational excellence in particular helps to ensure that our customers are able to do their daily banking without disruption, even during global lockdowns, and makes it possible for employees to work safely and securely from home.\n\nNow we're taking steps to deliver on our strategic priorities , not least to keep pace with society's accelerated adoption of digital resources during the coronavirus. We've been working on transforming our organisation to become a mobile-first digital platform, offering all of our 39.3 million customers a harmonised customer experience everywhere. But there's still work to do to be come the leading datadriven digital bank we aspire to be.\n\nBuilding on what we've learnt and achieved over the past five years, we took steps in 2020 to further consolidate our business and reinforce alignment. This includes uniting all our Retail operations -including the Business Banking segment serving small and medium-sized businesses and midcorporate clients -under one global management team with one consistent unified approach.

For Wholesale Banking this means deepening our relationship with our core clients, reducing our geographic footprint in Asia and closing our offices in South America. In Retail Banking it means stopping the Maggie transformation programme (to standardise the customer experience and product offering in four Challengers Markets) and instead focusing on using and reusing existing apps and modular components to drive scaling and speed of delivery.\n\nRecognising the need to move even faster if we want to stay a step ahead of the changes and evolutions in the world, we announced in 2020 that we are combining all our innovation activities into a dedicated business area called ING Neo. This will help sharpen our focus and create more impact, ultimately deepening our relationships with our customers as their primary bank for financial and other needs.\n\nThe introduction in 2020 of our first global tagline 'do your thing' moved the ING brand another step closer to looking, sounding and feeling the same everywhere. It articulates ING's purpose. We want to make banking frictionless, removing barriers to progress and giving people confidence in their ability to move forward.\n\n## Think Forward\n\nING's purpose is empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. Our Think Forward strategy promises customers we'll make banking clear and easy, anytime anywhere, empower them to make informed financial decisions and keep getting better. Where our purpose guides us, the\n\nstrategic priorities set out in our Think Forward strategy help us to focus on the elements we need to be successful.\n\nThese strategic priorities are: earning the primary relationship, mastering data, being innovative to serve changing customer needs, and developing new services and business models beyond banking. We achieve this by simplifying and standardising our products and processes, being operationally excellent, enhancing our performance culture and expanding our lending capabilities. These are the strategic enablers for executing on our strategy. See the graphics in this chapter for more information about our strategic priorities and enablers.\n\n## Platform approach\n\nWhile many businesses struggled in 2020 to survive global lockdowns, many Big Tech companies thrived on society's growing reliance on technology and the online economy. ING's competitive landscape is also increasingly shaped by these companies, which offer an engaging digital experience on an open platform that meets a range of needs in one go-to digital ecosystem.\n\nWe believe platform providers are all about customer experience. They use data to pinpoint what customers need and partner with third parties to ensure there is always a fitting product or service to meet this. Platforms are empowering. To remain relevant, ING has to be where our (future) customers ar e, on the platforms they're on , while maintaining the highest possible standard of integrity.\n\nIn an age of disruption and changing customer expectations we have to keep adapting our banking services to become clearer, easier and more accessible while empowering our growing global customer base to stay a step ahead in life and in business. Open banking creates opportunities for ING to add value for customers by connecting to the products and services of others, both within and beyond banking.",

        "page_content": "- > Our Strategy\n\nWhen it comes to platforms, we are developing our own solutions. We're building digital channels on top of our technology platform , like ING's mo bile OneApp, which is used by customers in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany . We're investing in independent initiatives such as Spanish finance app Fintonic , and we're connecting to third -party platforms offering relevant products and services. Among these are initiatives that have evolved into stand-alone platforms such as smart money app Yolt and corporate multibank platform Cobase.\n\n## Touchpoint platform\n\nSupporting our ambition to be the leading data-driven digital bank , we're using a modular technology foundation to create business-wide propositions that are globally scalable. This includes an open technology platform called Touchpoint. The Touchpoint platform provides ready-made solutions, modular components and reusable services the business and IT can use to build and run scalable business services and global value propositions. They can also distribute these to a large third-party ecosystem. In this way we can share innovations, use and re-use standardised components, and bring new products to customers faster and in more countries.\n\nThrough the Touchpoint platform, new and existing ING business initiatives have access to 25.2 million customers (around 65 percent of our customer base) in an internal and third-party ecosystem. It is enabling scalable business solutions that aim to harmonise the customer experience. And it connects ING to third parties through common architecture and shared application programming interfaces (APIs). The Amazon partnership was made possible by using Touchpoint to integrate fintech Lendico 's lending platform for small and medium-sized businesses with ING in Germany.",

We use data to personalise our customer interactions and gain insights to deliver a differentiating experience. It also helps us make sound business decisions and drives innovation. At the same time, we want to protect people's data and their privacy and are committed to handling data safely and being open about how we use it.\n\nIncrease the pace of innovation to serve changing customer needs\n\nThinking beyond traditional banking to develop new services and business models\n\nNew technologies enable new ways to do things and disrupt the status quo. To stay relevant it's essential that we evolve too. This means coming up with disruptive products, services and experiences that support our strategic ambitions and keep ING a step ahead.\n\nPersistent low/negative interest rates offer savers little incentive, challenging our traditional business model. Digital platforms are an opportunity to become relevant to customers by providing new products and services, also in areas beyond banking, which offer new revenue streams for ING and provide a better customer experience.\n\nBy this we mean increasing the number of customers who have multiple ING products (including a current account into which a recurring income, such as a salary, is paid) or Wholesale Banking clients with anchor products such as lending and transaction services. It's closely linked to customer experience and satisfaction: the more satisfied customers are, the more likely they'll choose ING for additional products and services. Over the past five years we've consistently increased the number of primary customers.\n\n## Read more in\n\n## 'Our business'\n\nMaterial topics: financial performance, usability and accessibility of our products\n\n## Read more in\n\n'Mastering data' below and in ' World around us', 'and 'Our business'\n\nMaterial topics: customer privacy, culture, ethics and integrity, digitalisation and interconnectivity, cyber resilience\n\n## Read more in\n\n'Innovating to stay a step ahead' below and in 'Our business'\n\nMaterial topics: innovation, usability and accessibility of our products, digitalisation and interconnectivity\n\n## Read more in\n\n'Platform approach' above and 'Our business'\n\nMaterial topics: innovation, digitalisation and interconnectivity, customer privacy, culture, ethics and integrity",

        "page_content": "- > Our Strategy\n\n## Mastering data\n\nData is the lifeblood of organisations like ING. We use data to personalise our customer interactions and gain insights to deliver a differentiating experience. It helps us make better business decisions, while being mindful of using our data responsibly and in line with people's expectations . We rely on data-driven models to manage our capital and risk-weighted assets and improve risk management. Data on customers and their transactions is also essential in the fight against money laundering and other financial economic crime. Not least, data drives innovation. It is the main ingredient for artificial intelligence and robotics solutions.\n\nHowever, to make data meaningful it needs to be sorted, harmonised and put into context. The accuracy of our models relies heavily on the quality of the data that's used to develop them. It's essential to have one common approach for using and storing data. ING's data management strategy includes standardised data definitions (ING Esperanto) and data models (Esperanto Warehouse Model), which contribute to the availability, quality, integrity, usability, control and governance of our data. Read more in 'Laying the foundation' below.\n\n## Ethics and privacy\n\nW e acknowledge the need to protect people's privacy and are committed to handling our data safely and being honest about how it's used. This means we inform our customers and employees about how we use their data and respect their privacy when processing it. Read more about our approach to data privacy in ' How we make a difference ' .\n\n## Analytics and building our data capabilities\n\nBecoming a truly data-driven organisation requires stepping up our analytics capabilities. This means promoting data fluency among our employees and strengthening our analytics delivery. ING's Analytics Unit is responsible for coordinating these activities globally and aligning them with our business strategy, as well as building one analytics and data community. To enhance our data science capabilities -which we have identified as one of the 'Big 6' capabilities ING needs to succeed we have a n Analytics Academy, we've added an analytics track to our International Talent Programme for graduates, and we collaborate with academic institutions like Dutch Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) on artificial intelligence research. Read more about the 'Big 6' capabilities in ' Our people ' .\n\nOur analytics delivery is focused on solutions in nine areas: customer interactions, customer dialogue, risk and pricing, financial crime and regulatory technology (Regtech), intelligent operations, innovation and beyond banking, people and finance, and Wholesale Banking. In 2020, we further accelerated our advanced analytics capabilities and delivered solutions to different domains.\n\nFor example, in the Regtech space, we're using analytics solutions to identify potentially risky shell companies in corresponding networks. In the retail domain, we developed and implemented machine learning interest rate optimisation models for better-priced mortgages in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. In risk management we built more topic detection models for the early warning signals (EWS) monitoring tool, which should ultimately help reduce risk costs. We're also using analytics to develop acceptance models for consumer and business lending in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain, which help lower risk costs and increase acceptance rates. New collections models for the Netherlands and Italy help us identify clients in financial difficulty and that need our support at an early stage.\n\nIn addition, we stepped up our experiments and experience with chatbots and are creating value and scale. The benefits for customers include 24/7 contact, fewer human errors and a simpler user experience. In the Philippines, we launched a virtual assistant that directs customers to their needed answers. Similar initiatives have been or will be rolled out to other countries. In Germany, ING's virtual assistant pING answered 7.3 million customer questions in 2020, recognising 94 percent of queries on current accounts (the best chatbot out of 22 tested in various industry sectors), while our Turkish chatbot INGo not only answered customers questions, but also approved 547.6 million lira worth of personal loans (89 million lira in 2019).",

As such, it's at the heart of our Think Forward strategy. We rely on innovation to remain relevant to our customers and live up to our purpose. Developing truly disruptive products, services and experiences is also a prerequisite for realising our platform ambitions and moving beyond banking.\n\nSo far, our innovation focus has allowed us to turn great ideas into products and services that customers really need. Smart money app Yolt now has more than 1.6 million registered users. Blockchain solutions in trade finance are helping to make trades faster and simpler, for example by reducing the processing time for letters of credit from around 10 days to under 24 hours. Read more about the Contour platform and other distributed ledger technology solutions in 'Our business' .\n\nWhen the coronavirus crisis first hit, our focus shifted towards adjusting our operations to accommodate the new, more digital environment. Radical innovation moved down the priority list and certain projects were shelved: for example, an initiative to digitalise aircraft financing. Other initiatives benefitted from the growing demand for digital solutions, such as the trade finance tools of our coowned blockchain-based software company Komgo.\n\nWith the creation of ING Neo we ' re aiming to increase the speed and impact of our innovation by bringing together initiatives in Wholesale Banking, Retail Banking (platforms and beyond banking activities), the Chief Innovation Office and our venture capital vehicle, ING Ventures.\n\nING was recognised by Global Finance magazine as the most innovative bank in Western Europe at its Innovators 2020 awards. Our home-grown innovations in cash management (Zero Knowledge Proof Notary on Corda), the corporate finance category (CoorpID) and payments (FINN Banking of Things) also won individual awards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Our Strategy\n\n## How we innovate\n\nInnovative ideas come from inside and outside ING. All our employees are encouraged to think creatively and come up with ways of doing things faster, better and more efficiently. We stimulate their ideas through our bank-wide Innovation Bootcamp and local innovation ambassadors. For Innovation Bootcamp 2020, we received 444 ideas in four areas: how to disrupt lending before others do; empowering customers to strengthen their financial health; delivering a unique digital customer experience; and creating a world-class employee experience. The winning idea was ImpactING, which aims to make it easy for customers to have a positive impact on the planet via a sustainable bank account that allows them to contribute to a good cause with every transaction.\n\nIn November, we hosted the first Innovation Summit for all employees. The three-day digital event explored ING's impact on the lives of customers and employees, shed light on global digital trends and showcased our latest innovations. It was streamed to over 30 ING countries and reached approximately 1,500 unique users.\n\nING 's customised innovation methodology, PACE, combines lean start-up, design thinking and agile scrum. Its key feature is customer validation. This ensures we develop only what customers really want. More than 10,000 employees have been trained in PACE to date.\n\nIn 2020, the ING Innovation Fund allocated \u20ac25 million to accelerate innovation across the bank. Funding is available to any employee who wants to turn a breakthrough idea into reality.\n\n## External collaboration\n\nNobody knows what the future looks like or the technologies that may emerge. We recognise we don't have all the skills and knowledge in -house and we're open to investing, partnering and building with others.\n\nING Ventures is our \u20ac300 million fund investing in early -stage companies. It targets disruptive technologies that ensures customers and clients get access to best-in-class services. It also helps entrepreneurs with hands-on support, knowhow and access to ING's distri bution network. We\n\ncurrently have 34 investments, including WeLab (automated consumer loans in China and Hong Kong), Fintonic (Spanish finance app), Cobase (multi-banking platform for corporate clients), Ascent (regulatory compliance platform) and Axyon (AI-powered asset manager).\n\nING partners with those who look at banking from a different perspective. Companies like Scalable Capital in Germany, a robo-advisor, which attracted a billion euros in assets under management in its first 2.5 years. Or Eigen, a natural language processing fintech that offers ING a strategic capability in the intelligent operations domain. Deployed in use cases across retail and wholesale banking, Eigen is contributing to ING's digital transfor mation, creating tangible value for customers and employees by applying machine learning in areas such as corporate lending and SME banking.\n\nCurrently, ING has more than 200 partnerships. Not all our collaborations lead to new products or services, however, and we ' ve ended over 110 so far, mostly after unsuccessful or unsatisfactory proofs of concept.\n\nIn November 2020, in light of the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, which required us to reprioritise and reassess our programmes, we decided to stop our activities for Cumulus Park Studios . Part of the Cumulus Park innovation district in Amsterdam, where several ING buildings are located, Cumulus Park Studios is a collaborative initiative with local government and educational institutions to drive innovation and co-creation around the themes of urbanisation and digital identity. We remain committed to further developing the innovation district and will continue to collaborate with our district partners on a lower ambition level.\n\nING Labs is our incubator for potential scale-ups. Here we work with external experts, combining corporate innovation and entrepreneurial experience. We believe this contributes to a higher success rate and greater impact than either could achieve alone. We have four Labs worldwide, each with its own specific value space that matches local expertise and ecosystems. These are trade (Singapore), property, real estate and regulatory processes (London), creating minimum viable companies that are ready to scale (Amsterdam) and proofs of concept with fintechs to bring new tech solutions to market faster (Brussels, formerly Fintech Village).

        "page_content": "- > Our Strategy\n\n## Transformation\n\nTo deliver a differentiating customer experience globally we are streamlining our products and processes, enhancing operational excellence and harmonising our customer engagement platforms, supported by a global technology foundation. This foundation includes shared data lakes, cloud solutions and modular IT building blocks. It's also about monitoring and executing regulatory programmes globally that aim to ensure ING is a safe, secure and compliant bank.\n\nTo accelerate the execution of our Think Forward journey, we launched a series of transformation programmes in 2016 to unite similar businesses and bring us closer to one mobile-first digital platform offering one ING experience everywhere. These included:\n\n- \u00b7 Unite be+nl to combine the respective strengths of the Netherlands and Belgium.\n- \u00b7 Maggie (formerly Model Bank) to standardise the customer experience and product offering in four Challengers markets - Czech Republic, France, Italy and Spain.\n- \u00b7 Welcome to digitalise ING in Germany, which was completed in 2019.\n- \u00b7 WTOM to optimise, digitalise and standardise our Wholesale Banking offering in all countries.\n\nUnite be+nl involved, among other things, the large-scale integration of 600,000 Record Bank customers in Belgium in 2018, and the replacement of many existing IT systems with one digital platform. Integrating the back-end systems turned out to be more complicated. Yet despite the challenges and adjustments to the programme in response to changing circumstances, all our Belgian retail customers now use the same internet banking environment as the Netherlands (OneWeb) and 90 percent have migrated to the mobile OneApp used in the Netherlands and Germany. Unite be+nl runs until 1H 2021.\n\nGiven the coronavirus-related economic headwinds and our learnings from the complexities and costs of cross-border systems and product integration, we decided to refocus our activities in 2020 to ensure faster customer delivery and a continuously improving end-to-end digital customer experience.\n\nThis underpinned our decision in 2020 to stop Maggie as a programme. Launched in 2016 to integrate our product offering and provide a standardised easy, personal and smart digital experience for\n\ncustomers in four Challengers markets, Maggie delivered various customer experience building blocks and sales and services journeys.\n\nTo further develop our universal digital bank, we'll focus instead on using our global technology foundation, reusing already developed mobile app components, and rolling out global digital product offerings in the areas of insurance, investments and consumer lending. When identifying areas to build crossborder capabilities we'll weigh up impact versus complexity, always with the aim of increasing scalability and delivery speed. In this way we only need to develop once for multiple countries and can create a sustainable competitive advantage, accelerating customer engagement and business impact. Updating legacy IT systems with new technology standards and global solutions will also contribute to greater efficiency as we move towards becoming a global digital bank.\n\nThe creation in 2020 of one global retail management team was the next step in our journey to unify and harmonise our retail approach in all our markets. This will further reinforce alignment, improve prioritisation and drive a consistent retail strategy that aims to accelerate digitalisation, use our global technology foundation to enhance operational efficiency and excellence, and roll out global digital product offerings in areas such as insurance, investment and consumer lending.\n\nThe Wholesale Target Operating Model (WTOM) programme has come to a natural conclusion as it achieved cost, risk and income benefits for the Wholesale Banking franchise globally, the result of extensive work over the last years to replace legacy systems, applications with target solutions, and create a range of shared operational services. We have now decided to end WTOM and commence with digitalisation-orientated programmes in our Transaction Services, Lending and Financial Markets businesses.\n\n## Laying the foundation\n\nBuilding a universal digital bank requires a strong foundation that's the same everywhere: the same approach to data, the same processes, same systems and infrastructure and the same way of working.\n\nAt the heart of this is our IT strategy. ING is building a technology platform to facilitate our journey from a traditional bank to a data-driven digital bank. It is designed to create speed, scale and security as well as cost efficiency through programmes like ING Private Cloud, Touchpoint, the data lake",

This last programme supports the engineering journey from idea to working code that underlies our digital services and can easily be reused by other engineers worldwide. We continuously adjust and improve IT projects and programmes based on new insights, lessons learnt and the impact of developments such as the coronavirus. For example, at the start of the outbreak we had to increase our network capacity by 365 percent to facilitate the large numbers of users connecting from home: daily remote connections have grown by 285 percent since March.\n\nWe changed the top structure of the Tech organisation in January 2021, to better align with ING's digital and data-driven ambitions. This has brought all the assets belonging to the banking technology platform under one senior management line, helping to further the consumption and delivery of the features of the banking technology platform and improve impact.\n\nRelated to this, the ING Private Cloud (IPC) is the target platform standardising our IT infrastructure. It's where we store and process data and IT services such as our mobile phone apps to give customers a consistent experience in a secure and reliable way. Unlike traditional infrastructure, cloud computing enables pay-as-you-go usage, elasticity and full management by the user. To keep up with global usage, scalability, availability and delivery speed, ING is adding public cloud computing to our infrastructure offering. By end-2020, IPC was used in 15 countries. Around a quarter of global infrastructure now runs on IPC, up from 15 percent at the end of 2019.\n\nData lakes serve as digital repositories for all the internal and external data we collect, making it easier to share it across the co mpany. Having one 'home' for data is in line with our strategy of simplifying our banking systems. Aggregating our data allows us to exchange information and knowledge with each other more easily. To enable this data exchange we've created a universal data language called ING Esperanto . Translating local data of all ING entities is a significant challenge as it requires both subject matter expertise of local businesses and regulations and knowledge of ING Esperanto to be able to create and benefit from aggregated data in a governed way.\n\nING Business Shared Services BV (IBSS) is a fully-owned service company employing around 10 percent of ING colleagues globally. Its shared service centres in Bratislava, Manila, Katowice, Warsaw and Bucharest contribute to ING's digital transformation and cross -border scalability by centralising operational and IT support tasks in areas such as global data management, Tech services, nonfinancial risk and compliance, KYC, data analytics and modelling.\n\nRecognising the need for a strong engineering culture to achieve our Think Forward ambitions, we strive to develop and grow a global workforce of highly skilled engineers. We run global performance days, where we assess and calibrate engineers based on one engineering profile. The ING Tech Academy keeps engineers updated on the latest technology. We are pursuing initiatives to improve diversity in our teams. These include the ING Women in Engineering days and the Sparks community at ING in Australia, which aims to inspire and empower women in technology.\n\nING's one Way of Working (WoW) is based on agile, purpose-driven teams and allows us to respond quickly to changing customer demands and feedback. We've implemented ING's WoW in all retail countries as well as in Wholesale Banking and in many of our business support activities. Uniting so many different cultures requires a behavioural shift, guided by our Orange Code, and is supported by WoW ambassadors, bootcamps and training programmes. The coronavirus pandemic has made it necessary to adapt to new ways of working and collaborating remotely. Read more in 'Our people' .\n\nGovernment measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 in ING countries required us to adapt quickly to extended remote working. This accelerated certain IT programmes, such as the roll-out of cloud-based tools, enabling online collaboration and meetings. Remote working brings certain increased operational risks with respect to information security, data protection, the availability of key systems and infrastructure integrity. In 2020, ING continued to focus strongly on managing exposure to these risks and took steps to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our IT infrastructure to ensure the continuity of our business from outside the office.\n\nWe also have preventative measures in place that continuously test our resilience against cyberattacks and attempts to gain unauthorised access to our systems. These include a dedicated cybercrime expertise and response team and 'ethical' hackers. Read mor e in ' How we make a difference ' and 'Risk management' .\n\nWhen and how our employees return to the office remains hard to predict and largely depends on the situation in each country. When it is safe to do so, there are rotation schemes to allow a controlled return to the office. We will also pilot global principles that will guide our future way of working in the post-coronavirus world. These are based on feedback from employees and aim to balance the advantages of working from home and working from the office. We're taking a step -by-step approach that provides a degree of flexibility for local implementation and respects local labour laws.",

I work in the Security Defence Centre, which is part of ING's global Security Detection Response team. We're a multidisciplinary team of cybersecurity specialists based in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and Singapore. We're available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A typical day for me starts with a walk along the Amsterdam canals. Before leaving home, I always lock my door to keep out unwanted visitors. The same applies online: hackers will do everything they can to gain entry into our systems. Our job is making sure ING's connections are safe from cybercriminals. We keep a close eye on what's happening in the world around us and each day we go through the latest news about possible threats and attacks. One of the ways hackers try to gain access to our systems is through fake emails. They trick people into opening a link that spreads a virus or steals their login credentials. We investigate each incident to assess the severity and decide how serious the threat is and how we should respond so ING remains safe and secure.'\n\nSaina Moorlag is a cyberthreat manager in Amsterdam",

We want to help create a healthy planet with prosperous people. Our approach is inclusive and collaborative: working with others to ultimately make a bigger impact.\n\nWe believe that no single sector, much less one bank, can solve global issues like the climate crisis, money laundering or the impact of Covid19 on people's lives and livelihoods. When it comes to tackling challenges like these, we're more dependent upon united and collective act ion for real positive change than ever before. It's an opportunity for governments and businesses to work together on sustainable ways to revive the economy, protect the financial system against financial and economic crime and, in addition, address the climate crisis facing our world.\n\nAs well as helping customers and communities navigate the effects of the coronavirus crisis, we believe the two areas where we can have the biggest impact are climate change and financial health. We believe we can act as a catalyst for positive change in these areas through our financing decisions, by sharing our knowledge and through our innovation skills.\n\nING's biggest contribution to society is through our business: by fulfilling our function as a bank to process payments, provide loans and other financial services, and keep customers' money and their data safe and secure. We also have an important role in helping to prevent the financial system from being misused for crimes such as fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. With the migration to digital and mobile banking, operational and cybersecurity resilience remain absolute priorities. We need to ensure our networks are safe and secure for customers and employees, especially when they're accessed remotely. Read more in 'Safe, secure and compliant' below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\n- > How we make a difference\n\n## Creating value for society\n\nThere are many ways a bank can create value: it can grow financial capital, focus on human capital, produce intellectual capital and through the effects on natural capital. Customers entrust us with their financial capital. By meeting their needs and growing their capital in turn yields dividends to shareholders. We try to positively grow human capital by caring for our employees and equipping them for the future workplace. At the same time, we need to be aware of potential negative value created through our actions. For instance, financing carbon-intensive sectors puts natural capital (the environment) at risk. One of the ways we can mitigate this is through our Terra approach to steer the impact of our lending portfolio to support the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nIn living up to our purpose to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business, we are guided by our customer focus, while also balancing the interests of our other stakeholders -as well as our planet and its people. Now, more than ever, there is an opportunity for us to step forward and help the world build back better.\n\nIn our value creation model we show how value flows through our business and what we do, focusing on climate and financial health, as well as employees, innovation, and risk mitigation, for example. This is all brought together and underpinned by ING's Think Forward strategy.\n\n## Climate action\n\nWe seek to positively influence society's transition to a more sustainable, low -carbon economy through our financing. For instance, through our Terra approach. Terra is based on collaboration and ING worked with other banks to develop the open-source methodology used to measure progress in each of the nine sectors most responsible for climate change. We want this to become an industrywide standard as we believe it will increase the impact of the financial sector. We also work closely with our clients to support their transitions with products, finance and insights. Read more about our Terra approach in 'World around us' and 'Our business' .\n\nWe are also here to mitigate and manage climate risks. ING recently published its first climate risk report. Gaining a better understanding of the impact of climate risk on our business will make us more resilient and prepare us to deal with what may be ahead. Read more in ' Ris k Management' .\n\n## Prosperous people\n\nIn promoting a sustainable society we focus on financial health, giving people the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions about their finances. This is especially important at a time of economic uncertainty following the months of disruption to jobs and livelihoods caused by coronavirus-related measures. Read more about how we are supporting customers and communities to recover from the crisis in this chapter and 'Our business' .\n\nUnder the prosperous people pillar we also include human rights. Every person, everywhere has the right to be treated with dignity and have their interests considered equally. ING and its clients have the potential to impact human rights through their operations, not only as employers but also through their supply chains. We work to influence and support our business partners to respect human rights in multiple ways. Our environmental and social risk (ESR) framework includes an overarching policy on human rights to guide us when assessing the clients and transactions we finance.\n\nIn 2020, we worked on a tool to analyse salient human rights risks within our portfolio, which are forced labour, child labour and land-related issues. Gathering this data on our clients will help us strengthen our non-financial portfolio. We can use it to expand our knowledge of human rights risks, as well as gain a better understanding of how our clients are performing on human rights.\n\nING published its third annual human rights update in December 2020. These publications outline our policies, programmes and management of human rights risks. We report on human rights using the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework.\n\nThrough our approach to sustainability in the areas of climate action and financial health, and through the clients and projects we finance, we contribute to the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations: promoting climate action (goal 13), sustainable consumption and production (goal 12) and sustainable and inclusive economic growth (goal 8).

In 2020, this included a global activation on climate-related topics in 19 countries and the introduction of a series of global webinars on core themes relating to our sustainability direction and progress. These were attended by hundreds of colleagues from across the bank. In addition, colleagues around the world took part in social impact days, helping their communities respond to the pandemic. We now have a growing network of sustainability ambassadors in 14 countries and this continued to expand with the launch in November 2020 of a digital ambassador training programme.\n\n## Supporting communities through the pandemic\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic showed the willingness of our people to support their communities through a number of initiatives: f rom using ING's electric car pool in Poland to deliver groceries and medicine to those in need, to making face masks and raising money for local healthcare and disaster relief efforts. We used our digital skills to build tools to help solve challenges caused by the crisis. For example, we developed an IT solution for the Flemish government to make crisis payments to its citizens at short notice. In Germany, colleagues helped create an online platform where retailers with no web shop of their own could continue trading during the lockdown. These efforts were led by local ING teams in the various countries and supported with the creation of a global ING fund. We structured our support in three phases.\n\nIn the first phase, at the start of the outbreak in February, ING mobilised resources in 25 countries to help local organisations with relief efforts in their communities. The primary focus of these projects was to provide emergency support for hospitals, health organisations and organisations addressing food security for people impacted by the crisis. This included hardest-hit Spain and Italy, where we supported healthcare workers and the delivery and distribution of medical supplies to hospitals and first responders. We raised and contributed over \u20ac8 million to projects in the 25 countries during this initial phase.\n\n## Working with others to support financial health\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > How we make a difference\n\nExtending our support beyond ING countries, we launched our second phase in April, teaming up with UNICEF on the #Reimagine campaign to raise funds for critical medical and hygiene supplies to reduce transmission among children and vulnerable groups around the world. ING matched all donations made by customers and colleagues, contributing more than \u20ac2 million to UNICEF's global appeal .\n\nIn July, we launched the third phase, which involves funding for projects to help communities recover sustainably in the longer term. In this 'build back better' phase, we will align with other stakeholders and focus on projects in areas such as financial health, digital skills and encouraging sustainable enterprise and employment. So far we have allocated around \u20ac 3 million to support 17 initiatives for long-term corona recovery in 14 countries. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Projects to promote financial health in the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. For example, in the Netherlands, ING is supporting Humanitas 'Get a Grip,' which aims to help young people aged 16 to 27 stay on top of their finances, offering mentors and debt counselling if needed. In Madrid, where 46 percent of families suffered a drop in income as a result of the coronavirus, ING is partnering with the Nantik Lum Foundation on an initiative to increase the financial health knowledge of social workers so they can advise people seeking help. It's aim is to reach more than 25 percent of the city's social service centres, which could have a positive impact on up to 100,000 people.\n- \u00b7 Digital skills training to help unemployed people into sustainable jobs in Poland, UK, Netherlands, Italy and Belgium. One initiative is a partnership with the King Baudouin Foundation in Belgium to upskill disadvantaged Belgians. Run by an organisation called BeCode, it expects to train nearly 1,000 candidates and support them with job placements in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Incubators and accelerator programmes for sustainable and social enterprises in Bulgaria, Germany, Australia, Belgium and France. Among these are 'Open the circle', where we're partnering with Reach for Change in Bulgaria to support entrepreneurs with solutions that address the root causes of poverty and social exclusion. In France, we're working with NGO Social Builder to empower women in the tech industry to generate revenue and become financially independent, particularly those economically impacted by the coronavirus.\n\n## Supporting financial health in the community\n\nIn addition to the projects we supported in response to the pandemic, we believe we can make the biggest impact on improving financial health in three ways: information, innovation and involvement. To promote people's financial health, we focus on giving them knowledge and tools to make informed decisions and gain more control over their finances. Read more about innovative ways we're empowering people to save and invest their money in 'Our business'.\n\nIn 2020, ING continued to maintain several partnerships that directly and indirectly support financial health in communities. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Dutch debt prevention programme Schuldhulproute and its Geldfit website, which tests people's financial fitness and links them to municipal debt assistance programmes if necessary. We referred 34,000 customers to geldfit.nl in 2020 and started referring business customers to Geldfit Zakelijk.\n- \u00b7 The ING Nederlands Fonds supports around 25 projects with organisations like the Over Rood foundation, providing debt-relief training for self-employed freelancers. and the Youth Perspective Fund aimed at keeping 18 to 27-year-olds financially fit.\n- \u00b7 Almost 1,000 colleagues in the Netherlands participated in a training programme offered by Nibud, the national institute for family finance information, to learn how to identify signs of financial distress among friends and family and help them find the right support. They can also train to mentor youth with financial difficulties.\n- \u00b7 In Romania we continued to work with Banometru , a free service providing mentoring to people in financial distress.\n- \u00b7 Globally, ING continued to partner with UNICEF on Power for Youth , a long-standing programme to equip teenagers (aged 10-19) with financial, entrepreneurial and civic leadership skills. Since 2015, the partnership has directly empowered over 500,000 adolescents, benefiting more than 11 million young people indirectly. These activities were superseded in 2020 by our other fundraising efforts with UNICEF in response to the coronavirus.\n\nIn total, ING raised and donated over \u20ac24 million over the year , of which around \u20ac10 million was donated to coronavirus rel ief in ING countries (and excluding donations to UNICEF's global appeal).

The Think Forward Initiative (TFI) aims to empower people to make sound financial decisions. It is an open source collaboration between ING, Deloitte, Dell Technologies, Amazon Web Services, IBM and the Centre for Economic Policy Research, supported by a network of 1,900 individuals from a broad range of organisations. It focuses on adding value through its three hubs.\n\nThe TFI Research Hub works with a global network of academics to develop insights into how people make financial decisions. The Accelerator Hub activates these insights through innovations and tools that will help consumers. The Community Hub promotes these activities and spreads TFI's insights through its network.\n\nIn 2020, eight start-ups graduated in the Accelerator Hub's Growth Track programme. These included:\n\n- \u00b7 Monkee, an app motivating people to save by setting defined goals and weekly targets (https://monkee.rocks)\n- \u00b7 AdviceRobo, which uses behavioural data to predict credit risk (advicerobo.com)\n- \u00b7 Mitto, a prepaid card for young people from age 14 years (getmitto.com)\n- \u00b7 Tully helps people to build a budget online and make the most of their money (tully.co.uk)\n- \u00b7 Pirkx, which offers a benefits package for self-employed and contract workers (pirkx.com)\n\nDuring the year, the Research Hub published several academic research reports on topics such as 'how convoluted language affects the way consumers understand and purchase financial products ', ' financial literacy and attitudes to cryptocurrencies ' and ' how financial distress relates to mental health '.\n\nThrough TFI, ING aims to provide value to both our customers and our communities. In 2020, we reached 38.5 million people in 13 European countries by sharing TFI research insights and solutions with our business units and the start-ups participating in the Growth Track programme. TFI's vision is ultimately to empower 100 million people to make better financial decisions.\n\n## Safe, secure and compliant bank\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic showed a growing reliance on digital banking, with the number of mobile card transactions more than doubling in 2020. With this comes an increasing risk that some of these interactions are used for criminal purposes. Digitalisation also brings other threats that could erode people's trust in our business and our sector, such as identity theft, security breaches or IT system failures. One of our top priorities is to keep our bank safe, secure and compliant . It's how we can contribute to the collective fight against financial economic crime and safeguard customers' trust.\n\nWe take our responsibility as a gatekeeper to the financial system extremely seriously. Since 2017, ING has been working to further enhance the management of compliance risks and embed stronger awareness across our organisation, especially when it comes to know your customer (KYC) and financial crime-related policies, procedures and processes.\n\nAs we operate in a dynamic and challenging environment, we are continuously learning and improving while getting to a more sustainable and mature level in exercising our role as a gatekeeper that fights financial economic crime.\n\n## Fighting financial economic crime\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, around $2 trillion in criminal money is laundered through the international banking system each year. They use schemes such as shell companies, smurfing (when large transactions are broken up into small amounts to avoid detection) or fake invoices. The scope of the problem was illustrated in media reports in September, in which several banks, including ING, were mentioned in respect of 'suspicious activity reports' filed some years ago. Read more in 'Risk management' .\n\nPreventing money laundering and maintaining the integrity of the financial system is challenging for all banks, given the constantly changing environment and pace at which criminal activities evolve. We can be more effective in our efforts to identify and combat threats if we work with other banks, law enforcement, regulators and government bodies to collectively fight financial crime, and by sharing intelligence at a national and international level.",

        "page_content": "- > How we make a difference\n\nING and four other Dutch banks joined forces in 2020 to form Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL). In the future, TMNL aims to jointly monitor the combined payment transactions of all five banks -currently an estimated total of 12 billion transactions a year, or 33 million a day in the Netherlands -for indications of money laundering or terrorist financing. This is in addition to the banks' individual monitoring activities. Initially they will start with monitoring business transactions in 2021. To facilitate this, the Dutch government is proposing to amend the law to make it easier for the banks to share relevant payment details with each other as part of its anti-money laundering action plan. If approved, the proposed bill could pass into law in 2021.\n\nTMNL follows a similar collaboration with banks and payment provider Isabel in Belgium. ING also works closely with the Dutch central bank (DNB), the Dutch Banking Association (NVB) and the Dutch Financial Expertise Centre (FEC) to harmonise efforts to fight financial economic crime and strengthen the integrity of the financial sector in the Netherlands. In Germany, we are part of the Anti-Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA), a public-private partnership to foster the mutual exchange of information.\n\nIn 2020, ING set up a financial and economic crime Covid-19 taskforce to assess whether the pandemic influenced payment patterns or created new channels for money laundering and to identify potential criminal schemes. This might inlcude companies misusing government aid or money launderers looking for alternate ways to channel illicit funds into the financial system during lockdown.\n\nCriminals are harnessing technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to become ever more sophisticated. These technologies can also help us to counter this threat. For example, Hunter is an AI-powered anti-money laundering tool that has the predictive capability to detect (emerging) suspicious patterns and entities. It helps identify clients with a high concentration of suspicious behaviour and points out hidden relationships, delivering on the promise to always be a step ahead. And we've developed a centralised digital vault where corporate clients can store and sha re their KYC documentation in a secure way. Similarly, the ING Lab in Singapore is working on a tool to help banks that serve other financial institutions eradicate the duplication of KYC documentation.\n\n## Know your customer\n\nKYC is a crucial element of being a safe and compliant bank. It aims to ensure we only engage with and do business with people and companies that meet regulatory requirements and are within our risk appetite. This includes carrying out customer due diligence checks and monitoring transactions for unusual activities, as well as assessing the environmental and social  impact of the companies and projects we finance (see the Credit risk chapter for more information).  At year-end, we had more than 4,000 people working on KYC globally.\n\nWe assess our relationship with customers regularly and review potentially unusual transactions. Where applicable, we report these to the relevant authorities. Over the years, and especially after 2017, we have discontinued a number of customer relationships that were not in line with our policies or risk profile. Read more in 'Risk management' .\n\n## KYC enhancement programme\n\nWe're constantly working to strengthen our KYC implementation. One of the ways we do this is through the global KYC enhancement programme. It consists of enhancing customer due diligence files (documentation, data and identity verification) and making structural improvements to become sustainably better in the way we fight financial economic crime. These structural solutions include standardised KYC policies and digital tooling; global KYC governance to ensure consistent decisionmaking; and increasing employee knowledge and awareness of KYC. Transaction monitoring is another key part of the programme. This includes both looking back on selected past transactions as well as ongoing monitoring, and deploying consistent global tooling for adverse media screening and name screening of new and existing clients.\n\nIn September 2020, Banca d'Italia removed its ban on ING onboarding new customers in Italy, in recognition of the comprehensive steps taken to strengthen our KYC processes and the management of KYC compliance risks. The Italian central bank had imposed the ban in March 2019 after it found shortcomings in anti-money laundering processes. ING was also fined.\n\nTo provide wider, more holistic coverage on sanctions, transaction monitoring and screening we are bringing together all regulatory developments and activities related to financial economic crime within our regular controls frameworks aimed at ensuring we comply with sanctions while preventing money laundering, terrorism financing, tax fraud, bribery and corruption.",

        "page_content": "- > How we make a difference\n\nFor more information about developments in 2020, please see 'Know your customer' in the Com pliance risk chapter.\n\n## Knowledge and behaviour\n\nIn 2020, we took steps to further professionalise our KYC organisation by providing internationallyrecognised training in conjunction with ACAMS (the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists). This and other training are offered through ING's KYC Academy and its Risk Academy, which aim to equip our employees with the skills and knowledge they need to effectively fight financial economic crime.\n\nWithin the KYC process we carry out behavioural risk assessments to identify impeding behavioural patterns and their drivers. When necessary, we design interventions to mitigate the risks. These include senior leadership workshops and employee 'nudge' labs, which aim to design subtle triggers that steer behaviour in the desired direction and can positively improve KYC execution. Read more in ' Risk Management ' .\n\nFurthermore, we launched a new KYC learning module for all employees in 2020, as well as training on cybersecurity, sanctions and anti-competitive conduct. We also launched a new global Code of Conduct that builds on the ING values and behaviours in our Orange Code, which puts integrity above all.\n\n## Digital access\n\nAs banking becomes more and more digital, customers expect to have round-the-clock access; their tolerance for technical failures is low. Reputation starts with satisfied customers, so we have to ensure our systems are available whenever our customers need them. At the same time, the demands on our network are growing as our employees now also rely on being able to connect to their digital workplace safely and securely at all times. The steps we took in 2019 to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our IT infrastructure, as well as continuously managing IT risk, meant that in combination with some extra effort from our IT infrastructure teams, we were able to facilitate the switch to working from home for the majority of employees within days. We will continue our efforts aimed to ensure we meet the access needs of both our customers and employees as we move towards a 'new normal' after Covid -19.\n\n## Cybercrime resilience and fraud management\n\nCriminals took advantage of the uncertainty during the coronavirus pandemic to target vulnerable people and organisations with cyberattacks, phishing scams, spoofing scams, malicious software and other types of fraudulent activities. ING's operational structures proved their resilience and capac ity to weather these unprecedented challenges. Keeping our customers, employees and business safe from these attempts remains a top priority.\n\nTrends observed during the year, such as accelerated digitalisation, growing customer use of digital channels and working from home, were assessed on their additional risks and compensating measures were taken or are being initiated. The increasingly professional and automated techniques criminal networks use to gain unauthorised access to people's money and their d ata continue to give cause for concern. To counter this, ING has preventative measures in place to retain customers' trust.\n\nING has dedicated cyber response teams to detect and respond to digital fraud, DDoS (distributed denial of service) and targeted at tacks. We continuously test our cyber resilience and invite 'white hat' (ethical) hackers to share their observations via our Responsible Disclosure programme.\n\nNo major cybersecurity incidents occurred during 2020, despite the increasing sophistication and frequency of attacks. To an increasing degree ING had to respond to breaches at third parties or service providers, a trend seen across the financial industry. DDoS attacks are 'business as usual' for our cybersecurity teams. DDoS attacks in Turkey and Belgium this year had some impact. So far, ING has not experienced material impact or loss of data due to cybercrime, although the costs to protect our customers against cybercrime are rising.\n\nCybercrimes like hacking, phishing and spoofing can lead to fraud, which can affect our business and our customers. In the Netherlands, customers of several banks became the target of a spoofing scam in 2020 that tricked them into transferring money from their accounts. ING was one of the banks that reached an agreement with the Dutch Ministry of Finance to compensate these victims for their financial losses.",

(Read more about the 'Big 6' in 'Our people' ). Focused training and awareness of all our employees contributes to making ING a safe, secure and compliant bank and helps us maintain the trust of our customers. In 2020, we ran an internal campaign to highlight the threat of phishing and rolled out a cybersecurity e-learning for all employees. For specific employee roles there is a security curriculum that is regularly adjusted to stay up to date with developments.\n\nCybercrime crosses sectors and borders and we therefore encourage a common, cross-industry response in collaboration with other companies and government authorities. We maintain a strong global cybercrime alliance with the financial industry and recognise the value of an effective regulatory framework. We value cybersecurity led by actual threats rather than rule-based compliance.\n\n## Data privacy and protection\n\nCustomers trust us with confidential information and their personal data. It is important that we maintain that trust and protect them against the loss or misuse of their data. In an environment that's increasingly open and connected we have to be ever more vigilant.\n\nING is bound by global and local data protection laws, which can differ from country to country, and we are transparent about what we do with the personal data of customers, employees, suppliers and business partners. Our appro ach can be summarised as 'the right people use the right data for the right purpose'. In line with the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR), we only process personal data for legitimate business purposes. More information can be found in the Privacy Statement on our websites.\n\n## Data ethics\n\nBeyond regulatory compliance, we are sensitive to people's expectations about the use of their data. We are mindful that processing data could have an impact on their lives or their businesses. We consider this impact when making decisions about the use of data. We apply consistent ethical values across our organisation while local and global Data Ethics Councils help to ensure we use data responsibly.",

It's a not -for-profit organisation founded by three university students in response to the coronavirus pandemic. We deliver groceries and other essentials to people in need, or who are at risk of getting sick. At the start of the outbreak, my team delivered primarily to the Bronx, a New York City borough with pockets of severe poverty and which had the city's second -highest number of Covid-19 cases. In its first month, IHD made over 3,000 deliveries! Since then, it's expanded into other cities and states, often partnering with food banks across the country to fight food insecurity and support those most impacted by Covid. Over the weekends, I make contactless grocery runs and food bank deliveries for individuals in need. I've completed more than 100 so far, and counting. Coming from Italy, but having lived in New York for 17 years, I'm painfully aware of the differences in so cial support available in the US.

Building on this, we adapted our processes and service models to make banking safer, easier and always accessible to customers in a time of social distancing, and put measures in place to help them deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their finances.\n\nThese included contactless payments, more flexibility on loan and mortgage repayments, financial advice and partnering with business clients big and small to support them in the most appropriate way. We also strived to provide uninterrupted access to our banking services. In 2020, weighted system availability 1 for Retail Banking customers in the Netherlands and Belgium was 99.6 percent and for Wholesale Banking clients worldwide system availability was 99.9 percent.\n\nReduced economic activity during the year meant demand for consumer and business loans was lower in a number of markets, and the ongoing low/negative interest rate environment pushed our net interest income down. Yet our results remained resilient throughout the year. Demand for mortgages remained healthy and we were able to grow our fee income as considerably more customers chose ING's accessible digital retail investment products. We ended the year with improving cost control and a strong capital position, contributing to a full-year result before tax of \u20ac 3,809 million. For more about our financial results see ' Our Performan ce' .\n\nRecognising the growing demand for digital and platform services, we took steps in 2020 to increase the pace of end-to-end digitalisation across our business and make our products and processes even easier, smarter and more efficient, from onboarding new customers to instant payments.\n\nAt the same time, to provide our 39.3 million customers with a differentiating and engaging experience everywhere and to move closer to becoming a universal data-driven digital leader, we aligned our Retail organisation under one management team with shared global priorities aimed at harmonising customer engagement and selected products on cross-border platforms. Read more in ' Achieving our business goals' below.\n\nWe also centralised innovation, introduced ' d o your thing' -ING's first global tagline -and harmonised our activities for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and mid-corporate clients in seven countries in a new Business Banking segment.\n\nIn Wholesale Banking we deepened our focus on core clients, supported by steps to build differentiating value propositions to meet their needs. This also supports our strategy to diversify income by generating more fee-based business. We continued to focus on digitalising our processes and streamlining our organisation to deliver faster and better to clients. As part of the focus on core clients, we announced measures to simplify our geographical footprint, withdrawing from South America and selected Asia markets while continuing to serve the needs of clients in those markets from our regional hubs.\n\n## Our markets\n\nING serves over 39.3 million individual customers as well as small and medium-sized businesses up to multinational corporations and financial institutions.\n\nOur Retail Banking business line offers private individuals a full range of products and services covering payments, savings, insurance, investments and secured and unsecured lending. This segment also includes self-employed entrepreneurs, micro businesses, small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and midcorporate companies who are served by our Business Banking proposition in several European countries . These business customers earn revenues of up to \u20ac250 million and our goal is to help them manage and accelerate their business.

        "page_content": "- > Our business\n\n## Supporting customers in crisis\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis impacted our customers in many ways. Across our business we took action to help them navigate the economic headwinds and stay in control of their finances during this turbulent time. ING's support began with the basi cs: aiming to provide uninterrupted access to our mobile and digital channels when customers need them most and making their lives easier with digital tools such as contactless payments.\n\nTo ensure the continuity of services our Wholesale Banking clients rely on, certain business-critical operations such as Financial Markets, Treasury, and Payments, were split across different locations during  global lockdowns.\n\nIn the Netherlands, 85 percent of all card payments in 2020 were contactless via plastic cards and third-party services like Apple Pay, as well as our own Android solution in the banking app, which is now also available in Australia, Poland, Romania, Germany, France, the UK (via Yolt), Italy and Spain. Driven by accelerating digital behaviour of our customers, the use of mobile payments increased rapidly against a backdrop of lockdowns and other Covid-19 measures, both as a share of total card payments and total contactless payments. Customers appreciate not having to enter their pin code on a terminal.\n\nIn countries such as the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Turkey, we increased the daily limit for contactless payments so customers could use this option more often and made it free to withdraw cash from ATMs (in some countries this is already a free service). Customers in Poland can use their mobile phones to make contactless ATM transactions. Also in Poland, it's now possible to open a new account from home using just a mobile phone and an ID card.\n\nNew mortgage customers in Australia can now validate their identity by video; video calls to advise customers on investments and other matters replaced face-to-face contact in Belgium and the Netherlands. For primary customers in Australia, ING maintained a higher savings interest rate even when they did not reach the salary deposit requirement.\n\nIn some countries, a limited number of branches remained open for customers who wanted in-person advice. In our branches we took precautions to ensure the safety of customers and employees, such as\n\ninstalling plexiglass screens, making hand sanitisers available, splitting teams and limiting visits to by appointment only.\n\n## Payment holidays\n\nCustomers in all retail countries were offered mortgage holidays and deferrals on loans and credit card repayments. We granted 196,000 customers payment holidays totalling \u20ac 19.4 billion since government measures were introduced in various countries to protect people impacted by job losses and loss of income during the lockdowns. Of these, 55 percent were for customers in the Netherlands and Belgium. By the end of the year, 93% of payment holidays had expired. We also provided around \u20ac1.5 billion of government -guaranteed facilities to support our business clients.\n\nIn addition, ING worked closely with business clients to understand the direct impact on their individual situations. Some industries, such as travel, hospitality and transport, were more severely affected than others. In the most heavily affected sectors governments also stepped in to protect companies and jobs with measures such as tax payment holidays and compensation schemes. Between March and May we collected feedback from over 18,000 businesses in six countries through regular pulse checks to gain insight into their needs.\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict how the pandemic will develop, additional lockdowns across Europe in the autumn and the phasing out of related payment holiday schemes and other support measures could potentially lead to more business insolvencies and unemployment. This could lead to more customers getting into financial difficulties and to higher levels of default.\n\nMore information on the impact of Covid-19 on ING as well on the related risk measures taken to address it can be found in the 'Risk management' section. The financial impact of the coronavirus crisis on our business can be found in 'Our performance' and throughout the financial statements section of this report.",

        "page_content": "- > Our business\n\n## Short-term liquidity\n\nIn times of crisis, companies need to be able to make swift decisions and want a financial partner they can trust to be there for them. For many businesses, their most urgent initial need was support with liquidity, particularly when markets are as volatile as today.\n\nIn Turkey, ING worked with the World Bank and Turk Eximbank on a \u20ac380 million loan to support exporters with financing during the crisis.\n\nIn the Netherlands, we dedicated \u20ac 1.1 billion for loans to SMEs. Part of these funds will be guaranteed by the European Investment Bank and \u20ac 702 million of these loans will be sold against a favourable interest rate.\n\nING proactively contacted Wholesale Banking and Business Banking clients to discuss ways to ease the impact on their businesses, which in some cases was significant. By monitoring the business landscape to better understand which industries are most impacted we can tailor our support and solutions to specific industries and determine who needs our help the most.\n\nThese tailored solutions included ways of easing their short-term liquidity needs with funding set apart for Covid19 facilities. ING's capital markets teams placed \u20ac39 billion of bonds via active bookrunner roles for corporates and financial institutions and approved around 70 new liquidity facilities for topsegmented clients. By converting Covid-19 facilities into capital market mandates we believe we helped clients secure longer term funding more easily while lessening the risks for our bank by shifting exposure to the institutional market.\n\nIn May, ING collaborated with French bond issuer Caisse Francaise de Financement Local (CAFFIL) on Europe's first Covid -19-related bond to raise financing for French public hospitals.\n\n## Financial health\n\nManaging money is one of the leading causes of stress for people around the world as many struggle to meet their day-to-day needs or plan for their future. This was amplified during the Covid-19 pandemic. ING offered budgeting and debt relief advice and guidance to customers in financial\n\ndifficulty in partnership with organisations like the Dutch 'Geldfit' website , and financial counselling services in Australia and Romania. Read more in ' How we make a difference' .\n\nUsing our knowledge of innovation and digitalisation, we put insights about people and money into products, tools, research and education that help contribute to a financially healthy society. We believe that the right information at the right time can help people make better financial decisions. We are delivering that through forecasting tools, such as 'Kijk Vooruit' which gives Dutch customers an overview of upcoming payments. With Everyday Roundup, available in Australia, Poland and Romania, we help customers save while they spend (see 'Differentiating customer experience' below). In Belgium, w e've partnered with fintech Minna to manage customer subscriptions (see 'Platform thinking' below).\n\nAs a result of our financial empowerment activities, 27.8 million people (71 percent of our customer base) felt financially empowered by ING in 2020 1 . In 2019, this was 25.9 million or 67 percent. Our ambition for 2022 is for 30.2 million customers to feel financially empowered by ING.\n\n## Achieving our business goals\n\nWe still have a lot to do to become the leading data-driven digital bank we aspire to be, but we also have to remain flexible in dealing with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, changing customer behaviour, persistently low/negative interest rates and increasing regulation. That means continually weighing up benefits versus costs, consistently using what we have already developed, quickly applying learnings and best practices, and taking decisions to focus our activities to ensure we deliver on our strategic priorities.\n\nThese considerations informed the decision to reduce the geographical footprint of our Wholesale Banking business and to stop Maggie, our transformation programme to simplify and harmonise the product offering and experience of retail customers in four Challengers markets. Instead, as we develop our universal digital bank, we will focus on the global use of ING's technology foundation to build scalable cross-border products and a consistent end-to-end digital customer experience in all our markets",

        "page_content": "- > Our business\n\n## Global priorities\n\nThe accelerated shift to mobile and online banking in 2020 increased the urgency of stepping up the end-to-end digitalisation of our products and services. Linked to this is the need for good quality data to drive the engaging and personalised customer experience we are aiming for.\n\nBuilding on what we've learnt and achieved over the past years, we adapted our Retail organisation in 2020 to increase alignment around key priorities that will contribute to our ambition to become one global digital bank. Led by the new global Retail Banking management team, we will focus on rolling out global digital propositions converging towards a common engagement platform. And we are looking for new ways to be relevant to our customers and generate alternate revenue sources.\n\nInnovation is essential here. To increase the impact of our innovation and speed up execution, ING has created a new dedicated business area, ING Neo, which combines all of our initiatives and activities in this area. See 'Our strategy' for more information, and 'Continuing to innovate' below.\n\nOf course, keeping our bank safe, secure and compliant remains a priority for ING. Customers trust us to protect their money and their data. That trust is our licence to operate.\n\n## Unleashing sector potential\n\nIn 2020, we remained focused on providing our corporate clients with relevant advice, data-driven insights and customised, integrated solutions that make their day-to-day banking more efficient and support their business ambitions. This is in line with the revised Wholesale Banking strategy we introduced in 2018 to enable us to adapt to and overcome a challenging and complex market environment, as well as increased regulatory requirements, evolving technology, greater competition and our clients' changing needs. Addressing these challenges, amplified by the effects of Covid-19, required us to accelerate our priorities and refocus our activities to ensure we deliver to our customers faster and continuously improve the end-to-end digital experience.\n\nWe further developed our sectors strategy over the year, pairing local and global insight with sector knowledge and financial expertise, and we enhanced our client segmentation model, which helps us tailor our daily banking and advisory value propositions to clients specific needs. Based on similar considerations of aligning with our core client base and deepening our relationship, we made the\n\ndecision to withdraw from a number of countries in South America and Asia. We'll continue serving the international needs of our clients in these countries from regional hubs. We will stay focused on improving client service delivery and streamline our operating model by clustering similar activities and know-how in existing centres of expertise.\n\nSeveral deals in 2020 reflect this sector focus. These included a \u20ac1.6 billion debt financing package for Swedish sustainable battery producer Northvolt to finance Europe's first home-grown gigafactory for lithium-ion batteries. ING co-led the lending consortium. ING was also involved in the largest green loan to date in Asia-Pacific in the commercial and industrial (C&I) renewables sector, a US$75 million loan to Singapore-based Cleantech Solar.\n\nWe work with our Wholesale Banking clients to finance and facilitate their transition to low-carbon technologies. We've developed a comprehensive suite of sustainability products and services to help them, including green loans and green bonds. Read more below in 'Responsible finance' .\n\nIn July, we announced that due to Brexit we will move some Financial Markets activities from London to Amsterdam. Here we already have a relatively large Financial Institutions/Financial Markets risk organisation, which can be effectively used during and after the transfer of the operations. The move does not impact our clients or client coverage.",

Of these, 87 percent are mobile interactions, with a growing number of Retail customers only interacting with ING via their mobile phone: 40 percent versus just 12 percent in 2016.\n\nThis digital connectivity yields data and insights that contribute to a more personalised and empowering experience, giving customers even more reasons to interact with us. This is how we can become an essential part of people's digital lives.\n\nTo provide customers with an even more personal, easy and smart experience, we held our first fully virtual customer experience (CX) day in October 2020. More than 2,000 colleagues from Belgium and the Netherlands attended. They made small changes that can have a big impact, resulting in 291 customer experience improvements.\n\nAmong the new mobile features introduced in 2020 is a single sign-on that allows customers in the Netherlands to seamlessly switch between their mobile app and online banking, and we made it easier for them to block, unblock and replace their bank cards themselves. In Belgium, customers can use their bank app to manage subscriptions via third party Minna and send payment requests through Payconiq. And we extended 'magician mode' to Germany, which hides customers' account information when they swipe their hand in front of their phone camera while using the app in public.\n\nFor visually impaired customers, ING is the first bank in the Netherlands to provide a bank card with a notch in the side so they can easily recognise it and insert it correctly into an ATM.\n\nIn the Philippines, ING's newest mobile -only retail market, the ING app has been installed more than two million times since its launch in November 2018. The introduction in the Philippines of ING Pay in November 2020 led to over 60,000 new daily accounts in its first month.\n\nWith customers looking for alternatives to savings accounts in the low/negative interest rate environment, we're empowering them with smart digital investment tools like My Money Coach in Spain, Coach Epargne in France and Easy Invest in the Netherlands. In 2020, our retail investment products in Germany and Spain reached \u20ac 56 billion and \u20ac1 2.3 billion in assets under management",

In Germany, ING is the first bank to offer securities savings plans that allow all customers to invest small amounts (from \u20ac1) in shares, exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. With savings plans available for more than 1,800 securities, including more than 200 funds and ETFs without purchasing costs , it's a low -threshold entry into investing.\n\nING's Everyday Roundup (ERU) product is helping to make saving simpler. First introduced in Poland, then in Australia and Germany, it is now also available in Romania. More countries will follow in 2021. By rounding up every transaction and transferring the difference to the customer's savings account, it makes saving frictionless at a time when customers may be financially vulnerable (due to the coronavirus crisis). ING in Germany launched a 'donate to Unicef' option for rounding up and ING in Australia has a roundup option for mortgages. The next step will be investments. There are 850,000 active ERU users, of which almost half are in Poland and Australia, while users in Germany rose to 156,000.\n\nOur Yolt smart money app introduced a similar feature in 2020 called Money Jar. It too allows users to save while they spend by rounding up purchases to the nearest pound or euro and offering cashback from selected retailers. The money jar feature also offers handy tips and reminders for users to increase their savings. It's trained to recognise and save refunds, salary raises and even bonuses.\n\nThrough ING's bancassurance partnership with AXA, customers can create their own personalised insurance cover in a clear and easy way using their ING mobile app or the ING website. For example, customers in Italy only have to answer three questions to get building and contents insurance compared to 60+ previously -something they appreciate, rating the service with a 4.5 out of five for advice and satisfaction. The bancassurance offering is now available in five countries through 11 insurance products delivering banking linked to lending and home/life protection. A further two propositions for mobility and wellness are being built to provide full lifestyle protection for customers through ING's five billion digital engagements.\n\nIn the Business Banking segment, we are digitalising our proposition for SMEs, micro businesses, midcorporates and self-employed customers using the Touchpoint platform. This will enable us to standardise our offering for over 1.5 million businesses in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Germany and Turkey, avoiding duplication and unlocking synergies between the countries.\n\nOur call-centre platform, developed as part of the Unite be+nl programme, is providing a harmonised customer contact experience across multiple customer interaction channels in eight countries. Because it is cloud-based, customers receive the same services everywhere and it makes it easier for ING to share and adopt innovations and adjust to changing customer needs.\n\n## One brand\n\nThe introduction in 2020 of ING's new global 'do your thing' tagline in the Netherlands, Belgium, Romania, Poland and Wholesale Banking brings a common brand direction to the bank that will be extended to the other ING countries over time. We launched advertising campaigns that included new brand elements like a new style of photography, a sound logo and always signing off with 'do your thing' .\n\nThe tagline articulates ING's empowering purpose and encourages people to do more of the things that move them or their business. It is about people being free to focus on what matters most to them knowing that, whether in their private or professional lives, they can make their world a little better for it.\n\nIn Wholesale Banking, do your thing is linked to 'changemakers' companies and people that ignite and lead sustainable change in a responsible way.\n\n## Instant payments\n\nOpen banking has changed the way people pay, giving consumers more options and opening up this service to non-traditional providers. To keep up with payment trends, ING has introduced instant payments executed in real time 24/7, 365 days a year. In 2020, the service was extended, enabling payments instantly from the Netherlands to the rest of Europe. ING is also working with major retailers in the Netherlands to extend peer-to-peer payments (apps that enable users to request and receive payments instantly) so merchants can send their customers a mobile payment request on delivery of goods.\n\nFollowing a successful pilot in 2019, ING now uses SWIFT gpi in nine ING countries to make international transfers quicker and easier. With SWIFT gpi around 80 percent of international money transfers are done on the same day, compared with three to five days previously.",

        "page_content": "- > Our business\n\nFor Business Banking customers, ING added a bulk payment functionality to its payment initiation application programme interface (API), making it possible to pay up to 5,000 recipients simultaneously. In addition,  it supports multiple strong customer authentication, that allows all types of payments requiring two or more authorisations.\n\nMaking life easier for commuters on the go, ING is piloting Invisible Tickets, a Dutch initiative that allows them to seamlessly pay for public transport using mobile phone sensors. It is aimed at countries where the use of public transport is high, such as Germany, France, Italy, the UK and the Netherlands.\n\n## Platform thinking\n\nThe power of platforms is that they are open, borderless, scalable, empowering and generate large amounts of data through frequent user interact ions that can in turn be used to improve users' experience. To remain relevant to our customers we need to be on the digital platforms where they are spending their time shopping, socialising and working.\n\nING is exploring various platform business solutions. We are building our own platforms. Some of these have evolved into stand-alone platforms. Smart money app Yolt, mobile payments app Payconiq and corporate multibank platform Cobase are three examples.\n\nYolt, which now has over 1.6 million registered users in the UK, Italy and France, added new features in 2020, such as Money Jar, which helps customers save while they spend. Yolt Pay, currently in beta, uses open banking APIs to initiate money transfers between users' accounts and to pay others. The app also links to partners like MoneySuperMarket, PensionBee and Wealthify so they can invest, save on household bills and grow their savings. In 2020, Yolt was named the best personal finance app at the Wealth and Finance Fintech Awards.\n\nING can also add value for our customers by connecting to relevant products and services on thirdparty platforms. In 2020, we strengthened our SME offering as the first bank in Germany to offer loans through Amazon's sellers platform, which is mainly used by S ME companies. ING's banking platform offers these clients access to the digital lending solution of fintech Lendico, which provides loan approvals within 48 hours.\n\nIn Belgium, we partnered with Minna Technologies on a subscription service for customers. Using the ING app, customers can keep track of and manage their subscriptions, and even cancel unused subscriptions or switch to better alternatives through an automated process, helping them save money and time.\n\nThe integration of international payments platform Payvision strengthens ING's digital payments business, especially in e-commerce. Payvision is a subsidiary of ING that facilitates more than 80 payment methods in 150 currencies. Its combined e-commerce and in-store solution helps merchants to offer their shoppers a seamless checkout experience across all channels. Since acquiring Payvision in 2018, ING is exiting Payvision clients that no longer fit our risk profile.\n\n## Open banking\n\nThe introduction of the European Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) in 2019 is reshaping the banking industry. It requires banks to rethink traditional products and services and create new customer experiences that stand out in a competitive landscape. At the same time, open banking allows us to connect to other providers and integrate products and services to add value for our customers. Our open banking platform provides the key capabilities that allow ING to open up by establishing secure, scalable, compliant and uniform connectivity with external parties via application programming interfaces (APIs).\n\nWe believe open banking and APIs are a great way to foster innovation, accelerate digitalisation and integrate and co-create with others. Open banking propositions powered by API technology include the Lendico SME lending platform in Germany and the Minna Technologies subscription management app in Belgium. In daily banking, APIs boost treasury departments by delivering real-time cash and liquidity management.\n\nYolt Technology Services (YTS), the business-to-business arm of the smart money app, facilitates open banking for businesses across Europe by providing them with access to bank APIs that connect them to users' bank accounts to initiate payments.  In 2020, YTS surpassed one billion API calls -single uses of its API. In the Netherlands, France and the UK, it offers businesses API coverage to over 90 percent of bank accounts and its API infrastructure can connect to 80 percent of bank accounts in Belgium, Italy and Spain.",

The new service is available through ING's online banking channel and the mobile app.\n\nWe also use APIs to connect to our insurance partner AXA on ING's first multi -country product platform.\n\n## Cross-border customer engagement\n\nInternally, we are working to harmonise our customer experience where it's possible and beneficial on truly cross-border platforms, giving ING the same face in different markets and the same banking interface with the same look and feel everywhere.\n\nOne such example is InsideBusiness -ING's digital banking portal that provides Wholesale Banking clients with a single point of access to a growing range of products and services around the globe. It is accessible anytime and anywhere via web, mobile app and tablet. In 2020, there was rapid growth in the adoption of the InsideBusiness app: user numbers doubled from around 2,500 to nearly 6,000 unique users, while usage went up by 96 percent. We also doubled the number of self-service processes clients can initiate from InsideBusiness.\n\nGiven the complexities and costs of cross-border system and product integration, and in light of coronavirus-related economic headwinds, we announced in November 2020 that we will stop the Maggie transformation programme. Launched in 2016, Maggie aimed to integrate our product offering and provide a standardised experience for retail customers in four Challengers markets. We will instead focus on using ING's global technology foundation -shared data lakes, cloud and modular IT building blocks -to further develop our universal digital bank and the rollout of global digital product offerings in insurance, investments and consumer lending. We will continue to focus on implementing global solutions locally as a way to harmonise and standardise the customer experience.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, where ING is already a market leader, we are uniting our respective strengths to deliver an even better and more consistent experience across all channels for our combined 11 million customers. In the second quarter, customers in Belgium were migrated to the OneWeb banking environment shared with our Dutch customers. They also now use the same OneApp mobile environment as in the Netherlands and Germany, bringing us a step closer towards our\n\nambition to provide customers everywhere with the same easy, smart and personal experience. Around 1.8 million customers in Belgium are now using OneApp and OneWeb for online banking. In the Netherlands around five million customers use the app. New features were introduced in 2020 to empower customers to take charge of their own banking affairs via their mobile phone, for example to block a lost card or change their daily withdrawal limit, cutting back on the need to contact customer service.\n\n## Beyond banking services\n\nThinking beyond traditional banking is crucial to find new ways to be relevant to customers and create new revenue streams for ING. It strengthens our core businesses by engaging customers early, increasing the customer lifetime value and contributing to a more sustainable banking business model.\n\nWe can introduce new and complementary services through platforms. Shopping services can use our scale to provide better deals or cashbacks to customers. The DealWise shopping platform gathers cashback deals and discounts in one place. Users can save on their daily spending while merchants gain insights that help them better understand, acquire, develop and maintain customers. It is now available in Romania, with plans to enter Germany next.\n\nSimilarly, ING+Deals in Belgium and ING Punten in the Netherlands are shopping platforms offering customers exclusive deals in partnership with various A-brands. In addition to promoting customer loyalty, these shopping platforms help to increase interactions with ING's own digital channels. ING+Deals, with over 200,000 users generated more than \u20ac5 million revenue for our merchants in 2020, while ING Punten delivered a turnover of \u20ac 45 million from the sale of 1.4 million products.\n\nIn the know your customer (KYC) space, CoorpID provides a digital vault where corporate clients can securely store and share the KYC documentation required by multiple financial institutions. CoorpID was connected to ING's KYC organisation in 2020.\n\nING moved steadfastly on its housing strategy across Dutch and German markets with disruptive concepts like Scoperty and Makelaarsland. The near-term objective is to independently grow these and invest in synergistic business models. Makelaarsland is a property platform empowering people in the Netherlands to buy and sell their homes online themselves or with the support of a local agent.",

        "page_content": "- > Our business\n\nIn Germany, ING partnered with Sprengnetter on Scoperty, a real-estate platform connecting buyers and sellers of more than 35 million properties. The pre-qualification process for mortgages is aligned with that of Interhyp, ING's independent mortgage brokerage platform in Germany and Austria. Interhyp offers buyers access to 400 mortgage lenders. In 2020 its market share rose to 10 percent in Germany (nine percent in 2019).\n\n## Earning the primary relationship\n\nCustomer numbers grew in 2020, especially the number of primary customers. These are Retail customers with multiple active products, including a current account with recurrent income, such as a salary. In Wholesale Banking these are clients lending and daily banking products and at least one other product generating recurring revenues.\n\nEarning the primary relationship is a strategic priority for ING as it leads to deeper relationships, greater customer satisfaction and ultimately customers choosing us for more of their banking needs. We want our customers to do more than just some of their banking with us; we want to be their first partner, where they deposit their salary, handle their payments and do most of their other banking business.\n\n## Retail markets NPS\n\n## Number 1 in 6 out of 14 markets\n\n## Wholesale Banking NPS\n\n13% above industry average\n\nIn 2020, the number of primary customers increased by 578,000 to 13.9 million. Across retail segments, this comprises 5.8 million for Market Leaders, 4.9 million for the Challengers Markets -where primary customers in Germany grew by 330,000, a record 56 percent in net growth versus 2019 -and 3.2 million for Growth Markets.\n\n## Measuring customer satisfaction\n\nOne of the ways we measure our progress is through the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which indicates customer satisfaction and loyalty (whether they would recommend ING to others). The score is calculated as the difference between the percentage of promoters (who rate ING as 9 or 10 out of 10) and detractors (those scoring ING below a 6). Our aim is to achieve a number one NPS ranking in all our retail markets, with a 10-point lead over our main competitors.\n\nBased on a rolling average of our NPS scores in 2020, ING ranked number one in six of our 14 retail markets 1 : Australia, Germany, Poland, Romania, Spain and the Philippines. In four of these we are more than 10 points ahead of our nearest competitor. ING also has a top-three position in a further six markets. The introduction of current account fees in Germany in February 2020 led to a downward dip in our NPS score here, but overall we retained our number one position in Germany in all four quarters. In France, more innovative competitors overtook ING in the number one position.\n\nIn the Business Banking segment, we measure NPS in four markets. These are the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and Romania. The NPS for mid-corporate clients in the Netherlands improved to +18.4 (from +12.4 in 4Q 2019), well above our competitors (-23.3), based on feedback from clients who do business with multiple banks. Clients appreciate our sector knowledge combined with regional presence, with satisfaction highest in the services, industry and transport and logistics sectors. However, there is room for improvement to make the digital customer experience easier and more personal, especially for Dutch SMEs and self-employed clients, where our NPS among both client groups declined to -26 from -20 and -18 respectively. In Poland, the combined NPS for SME and midcorporate clients improved to +43 (from +30 in 4Q 2019). As we revised our methodology in Belgium we don' t have comparable figures for 2020. Although slightly lower than in 2019, the NPS for micro clients and SMEs in Romania is still a high +43 and +54 for mid-corporates.",

In addition, we introduced a transactional NPS to measure client satisfaction on service requests for daily banking. In 2020, the customer satisfaction exceeded 8.5 (scale 1-10). The overall NPS rating reached +56.3 (on a scale of -100 to +100), up from a score of +49.6 in 2019, and 13 percent ahead of the industry average of +49.8. The response rate also increased to 60 percent compared with 50 percent in 2019, showing higher client engagement with ING. The scores are based on thousands of responses from clients representing more than 50 percent of Wholesale Banking revenue. The NPS of Platinum and Gold clients showed an even higher year-on-year increase of 33 percent and 21 percent, respectively. All sectors also registered stronger NPS, with Energy achieving an exceptionally high score of +71.3, a 26 percent increase year-on-year. The higher scores suggest that clients appreciate our approach (see 'Unleashing sector potential' above) and that Wholesale Banking is succe eding in its strategy to focus on core clients, with as a result more resources allocated to a smaller group of clients and higher client satisfaction.\n\n## External recognition\n\nRecognising our efforts, Global Finance magazine named ING as the best consumer digital bank in Germany while Euromoney named us the best digital bank in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as best bank in the Netherlands and in Poland.\n\nFor the 14th year, German consumers voted ING their preferred bank in \u20acuro magazine's annual survey. In Australia, ING was named 'Best Bank' by financial comparison sites Mozo and Canstar . ING was also Canstar's Bank of the Year and 'Most Trusted Financial Institution' at the Australian Banking Innovation Awards. In the Forbes list of the world's best banks, ING ranked among the top five in seven countries in 2020.\n\nGlobal Finance also named ING as the most innovative bank in Western Europe. Three ING innovations also won Innovators 2020 Awards: Zero Knowledge Proof Notary (cash management category), CoorpID (corporate finance sector) and FINN -Banking of things (payments sector).\n\nIn Wholesale Banking, ING was recognised as Western Europe's best bank for transaction services (Euromoney) and the best investment bank and best trade finance provider in the Netherlands (Global Finance).",

        "page_content": "- > Our business\n\n## Continuing to innovate\n\nSince the introduction of direct banking in 1997, ING is still finding new ways to improve the banking\n\nexperience for our customers. Many of these advances stem from twinning the latest technologies with data insights. Growing demand for digital solutions is also spurring new ideas. Initiatives that have benefitted from this include the trade finance tools of the blockchain-based software company Komgo, which grew out of ING's Innovation Bootcamp (see 'Distributed ledger technology and blockchain' below). Also in trade finance, ING teamed up in 2020 with AI-driven trade platform Tradeteq, the first electronic platform that allows banks and institutional investors to transact trade assets. Tradeteq uses advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to derive more accurate risk scores, helping investors to better evaluate opportunities and offers an end-to-end solution covering portfolio management, risk analytics and securitisation-as-a-service.\n\nAt the ING Labs in Amsterdam, Brussels, London and Singapore, over 20 initiatives are currently in development to make disruptive impact in the value spaces of trade, lending, safety and compliance, financial health, and housing. Examples are Blacksmith, Loan Optics and Stemly. Blacksmith, which ING has started using for Wholesale Banking clients in Asia, provides banks with a single platform for digitally managing KYC requirements, connecting to trusted data sources, generating tailored KYC files for its clients and quickly implementing regulatory changes. Loan Optics is a platform for digitallynative loans. It reduces operational costs by streamlining the primary and secondary loan implementation processes. Stemly is creating an autonomous decision system for supply chain and finance processes.\n\nIn Wholesale Banking Advanced Analytics we're building artificial intelligence -powered products to better understand and serve our clients. These include improved monitoring and analysis activities for client-facing departments and Hunter, a tool that accelerates the detection and investigation of money laundering schemes, reducing the workload for our KYC colleagues. Domino is a tool that gives us a '360  view' of mid -corporate and corp orate clients to ensure we're having the right conversations at the right time to meet their needs. In addition, in 2020, we delivered a proof of concept to gain insight into how mid-corporate clients are dealing with the coronavirus crisis so we can help them where they need it most. It provides insights that go beyond our traditional knowledge of real-time client situations such as whether the client is receiving government support or needs support with tax payments.\n\n## Distributed ledger technology and blockchain\n\nWhen it comes to distributed ledger technology (DLT), ING is considered an industry leader. For the second consecutive year, Forbes ranked ING as one of the top $50 billion companies embracing blockchain technology. Cryptoground, a blockchain and cryptocurrency hub, named ING among the best blockchain stocks investments in 2020.\n\nEasy Trading Connect (now Komgo.io) was one of the first to reinvent commodities trade financing in 2017. Komgo, co-owned by ING, offers products that streamline trade finance, optimise liquidity, manage risk and verify customers. It recently created a new feature, TRAKK, that uses DLT to create provenance and immutability, allowing traders to ensure the documents are genuine and are not used for pledges to other parties. New DLT initiatives currently in the execution phase include solutions for digital assets safekeeping, tokenisation and issuance of a structured finance loan for institutional investors, and an intra-bank settlements utility token, among others.\n\nIn October 2020, Contour went live. Co-founded by ING in a consortium with other major global banks, Contour connects buyers, suppliers and banks across a decentralised digital platform to bring transparency and trust into trade financing. In its testing phase, Contour reduced the processing time for letters of credit (LCs) from an average of 10 days to under 24 hours. Another ING initiative is securities lending platform HQLAx, which uses DLT to facilitate trades in high-quality liquid assets, serving as an additional liquidity pool. It was commercially launched in December 2020.\n\nING's zero -knowledge proof notary service, a solution aimed at improving the privacy and security of DLT-based transactions, received an Innovators 2020 Award from Global Finance magazine in the cash management category. Built specifically to address the privacy requirements of R3's Corda platform, the capability is our latest development in this field of cryptography, following a suite of open-source privacy tools released in previous years.\n\nWe amplify our DLT impact by addressing how ING's solutions can solve key problems in the finance industry. Our DLT research team is constantly producing knowledge assets that can serve and influence the wider community: from reflecting on the challenges and benefits of digital assets, to collaborating with the Global Blockchain Business Council and the World  Economic Forum on the creation of blockchain standards.",

Through our investment arm, ING Ventures, we invest in companies with a strategic relevance for ING. These are start-ups with disruptive technologies that have the potential to improve the customer experience or ING's operati onal efficiency.\n\nA number of partnerships are focused on enhancing our data analytics capabilities. One example is London-based Eigen Technologies, which is working on natural language processing (NLP) models tailored to the financial industry's need for data extraction. The partnership is applying NLP and machine learning in areas such as corporate lending, trade finance and SME banking to automate processes and reduce risk and cost.\n\nFor our Business Banking clients we have a number of partnerships. Funding Options helps British and Dutch SMEs find the right loan for their business. FinCompare gives German corporate customers a quick and independent overview of their financing options. TransferMate provides SME customers and corporate clients with faster, cheaper and easier payment solutions. We are also exploring new business models. Countingup, a mobile banking app for self-employed entrepreneurs and freelancers, combines accounting and banking features into one seamless solution, greatly reducing operating complexity and cost.\n\nOn the topics of aggregation, PSD2 and open banking, ING is working with an ING-initiated company, Cobase, which is making it easier and more efficient for international corporate clients to work with multiple banks from one cloud-based platform.\n\nIn the area of operational excellence, we're working with fintech Duco on a reconciliation solution that strongly improves time to market in building reconciliations and lowers the cost of carrying these out.\n\nIn the Philippines, ING teamed up with the UNICEF Innovation Office to support fintech start-ups working on financial inclusion challenges (www.fintechforimpact.com). The Fintech for Impact initiative will provide financial support and mentoring for five projects: an app to bring affordable healthcare to rural communities; a tool to help migrant workers manage their finances; a platform connecting farmers and fishermen directly to buyers; an app connecting students to education loans; and an AIenabled platform to deliver grassroots insurance to low-income families.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Our business\n\n## Responsible finance\n\nAs a bank, we are committed to contributing to a low-carbon and financially healthy society, both through our own efforts and by helping our clients to be more sustainable. We make the most impact through our financing, via the loans we provide to clients. That's why we are committed to steering our \u20ac600 billion lending portfolio towards meeting the well -below two-degree goal of the Paris Agreement. We call our approach to measuring and steering, Terra.\n\n## Terra approach\n\nING's Terra sets out our approach for aligning our lending portfolio with the Paris climate goals in the nine sectors most responsible for climate change. Since 2019, we have made significant progress in further developing, refining and applying the Terra approach. In October 2020, we released our second progress report on Terra. It included quantitative results and targets for all of these nine sectors, fulfilling the commitment we made the previous year.\n\nThe re port's Climate Alignment Dashboard tracks our performance, showing the CO2 intensity per sector of our portfolio compared to the market and the relevant climate scenario. The portfolios for power generation, shipping, cement and steel are 'on track' for cl imate alignment, while residential real estate, automotive and aviation are 'close to being on track'. For the remaining two sectors we cannot yet benchmark our performance. For upstream oil and gas this is because the 2019 portfolio is our starting point and we will need to see movement relative to the scenario pathway, starting next year, before indicator status can be given. For commercial real estate we still lack complete and up-todate market data.\n\nING's power generation portfolio continues to outperform the market and both the International Energy Agency's sustainable development scenario (SDS ) and the OECD scenario. In the 12 months measured in the Terra report, ING reduced its direct exposure to coal-fired power plants by 43 percent (in line with our commitment to reduce it to close to zero by the end of 2025) and increased financing for renewable energy generation by \u20ac1.19 billion. Other sectors face more challenges, such as the residential mortgage sector. There we encounter a shortage of accurate data to measure progress and a general lack of homeowner action. Read the full Terra report on ing.com, and see 'Greener homes' below for more information about making our mortgage portfolio energy positive by 2050.\n\nOne of the targets included in the report is our aim to reduce financing to upstream oil and gas by 19 percent by 2040 from 2019 levels. We'll align this portfolio both by decreasing exposure and engaging with clients to help them shift to low-carbon technology. The measurement is based on three indicators: emission intensity, an absolute reduction in financing and a relative transition of the financing mix from high-carbon to low-carbon and renewable energy. This target is also aligned with the SDS scenario, which is not static. If more or quicker action is needed and this scenario is adjusted, our target will adjust accordingly.\n\nTerra's sector -based approach respects the fact that each sector has its own transition pathway for it to contribute to a low-carbon, below-two-degree world. We therefore use the most appropriate methodology per sector. One example is PACTA for Banks, which was co-developed by ING and nonprofit think tank the 2\u00b0 Investing Initiative (2DII). The methodology-specific application was further refined with more banks and published as an open-source methodology for all banks to use in 2020. It looks at the technology shift that's needed across certain sectors to slow global warming and then measures this against the actual technology clients are using -or plan on using in the future.\n\nWe believe that working together to achieve an industry-wide standard will increase transparency and ultimately help the entire financial sector to make a bigger impact. We also believe in an inclusive approach to climate alignment, as we work with our clients to facilitate and finance their shift to lowcarbon technology.\n\nWe will continue to monitor and report on our progress, engaging with clients and other stakeholders to advance on the journey to combat climate change. We conduct strategic dialogues with clients on how we can help them align their business with the Paris Agreement goals, for example by advising them on how to structure their financing and gain access to funding. We also contribute to policymaking to influence change on a larger scale. For example, we're working with the European Investment Bank on the implementation of the European Green Deal and we're providing input for proposals by the Network for Greening the Financial System on sustainable stress testing to assess the resilience of the financial system to climate-related shocks.\n\nOur efforts in this area are being recognised. In 2020, we were ranked as 'climate action leader' by the leading global environmental disclosure platform CDP for the seventh consecutive year. We also ranked first in our market-cap group by Sustainalytics and MSCI upgraded ING's rating to ' A A', which",

We believe we can make more impact with what we do finance than what we don't. So when it comes to people, we aim to increase our so cial impact finance portfolio by lending to projects that lead to, for example, basic infrastructure improvements, community development or essential services. And we're working on making a positive contribution to human rights as financier, employer, taxpayer and driver of progress and prosperity. This is also in line with the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Banking, of which ING was a founding signatory in 2019.\n\nWe have an inclusive approach to driving sustainable business. We work with our clients to facilitate and finance the shift to low-carbon technology. This includes environmental, social and governance (ESG) checks to ensure that our financing is in line with our own sustainability goals. Read more about our environmental and social risk policy framework at www.ing.com/Sustainability/Sustainablebusiness/Environmental-and-social-risk-policies.htm\n\nING is considered a pioneer in sustainable finance, having introduced the first sustainability-linked loan and a made-to-measure sustainability improvement loan. We offer various financial instruments such as green loans, sustainability improvement loans, green bonds and advisory services.\n\nIn 2020, we saw a visible softening of lending demand due to the impact of Covid-19 on economic activity. Our climate finance portfolio decreased by 12 percent in 2020 to \u20ac16. 5 billion (from \u20ac18. 7 billion in 2019), mainly due to lower lending volumes in renewable energy and sustainable buildings. Social impact financing for projects that lead to, for example, basic infrastructure improvements, community development or essential services, decreased by 29 percent to \u20ac 533 million. Please see the Responsible finance tables in the Non-financial appendix.\n\nDespite the decline in demand, we continued to shape sustainable finance in 2020 with the introduction of an innovative financing method to make inland shipping in the Netherlands more sustainable. A pay-per-use financing structure for renewable battery containers makes it easier for ship owners to transition from diesel-powered barges to electrical power without the need for a large\n\nup-front investment. ING and partners formed a new company called Zero Emissions Services (ZES) to facilitate the transformation. The Dutch transport sector is responsible for 21 percent of the country's CO2 emissions; ZES is moving it a step closer towards the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nIn 2020, we started to link the circular economy even more closely with our green finance products. The ZES transaction is an example of how ING is exploring circular financial business models with various partners. The circular economy offers a systematic response to the climate crisis. It's about rethinking our use of raw materials and resources to reduce waste and emissions, shif ting from 'take, make and waste' to 'reduce, reuse, recycle'. Companies like ZES stimulate other use models for depleted battery packs once they are exchanged to give them a second or even third lifecycle.\n\nING issued 36 sustainability improvement loans and 20 green loans. Among these was the largest green loan yet in the Asia-Pacific commercial and industrial renewables sector. The $75 million financing for Cleantech Solar will support more than 500 megawatts of solar power projects across Southeast Asia.\n\nIn addition to lending, ING supported 60 mandates for clients through green, social and sustainability bonds. In September, ING was involved in Ireland's first -ever green bond issued by AIB bank. The \u20ac1 billion will be used to finance renewable energy projects and green buildings in Ireland and Britain.\n\nING broke new ground with Europe's first Covid -19-related bond, which raised financing for French public hospitals. ING was the joint bookrunner in the \u20ac1 billion deal with French bond issuer Caisse Francaise de Financement Local (CAFFIL). Issued in May, it was the first negative yield bond launch since the end of February when the pandemic triggered a global sell-off and closed the primary market. ING's previous collaboration with CAFFIL on the first French social covered bond was a winner at Env ironmental Finance's Bond Awards 2020.\n\nING subsequently supported a further three issuers with Covid-19-related bonds, helping them to overcome the impact of the crisis. We acted as bookrunner in the \u20ac500 million social bond for Korea Housing Finance Cor poration; as joint bookrunner in the \u20ac1 billion social bond for CaixaBank; and joint lead manager on the \u20ac500 million bond for the Export -Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM).",

We're working with clients to improve the energy consumption of the houses we finance as a way of achieving our Paris alignment goals. Our long-term vision is to have an energy-positive mortgage portfolio by 2050. This means that the houses in our portfolio will collectively generate more energy than they consume.\n\nOur current carbon intensity measurement covers our Dutch and German mortgage portfolio, with a co mbined outstanding lending amount of roughly \u20ac180 billion (60 percent of total mortgage outstandings) and more than one million financed homes. See the latest Terra report on ing.com for information on the underlying measurement.\n\nWe are developing retail products, tools and services to help homeowners make their houses more sustainable. Customers can use these products to finance solar panels, for example, or insulate their homes. In Germany, we provide green mortgages through development bank KfW.\n\nIn addition to financial solutions, we help to raise awareness on the topic. Consumers in the Netherlands, for example, can check the energy profile of their homes on our website, as well as the options and financing available to improve in this area. And we provided Dutch homeowners who want to invest in upgrading their energy label with a free rating as we know how insights can help people to take the first steps towards a more sustainable home.\n\nHowever, the number of homeowners taking up this offer remains low. This likely reflects the cumbersome process of gathering data for an energy label upgrade. And although an up-to-date energy label is required when selling a home, only a small percentage of properties in our portfolio are sold each year.\n\n## Sustainable investment services\n\nING offers sustainable investment (SI) services to its Retail Banking customers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. In 2020, ING's retail brokerage division recorded \u20ac 13.2 billion in sustainability assets under management, up from \u20ac9.3 billion in 2019 .

        "page_content": "- > Our performance\n\n## Our performance\n\nING's results remained resilient in a tough year, with a full-year net profit of \u20ac 2,485 million. Performance was heavily affected by the impact of Covid-19. Reduced economic activity led to lower lending demand and the ongoing low/negative interest rate environment pushed net interest income down. Yet we further diversified our income with good fee growth, particularly for retail investment products as more customers turned to our accessible digital solutions. ING's CET1 ratio strengthened to 15.5 percent.\n\n## Capital management\n\nRisk and capital management remain central to the stability and continuity of the bank. Maintaining our risk profile within our risk appetite and strengthening our capital base is how we grow a sustainable business and achieve our strategic objectives.\n\nOur overall approach to capital management is to ensure that we have enough capital to cover our (economic) risks at all levels, including the risks from the ongoing pandemic, and comply with local and global regulations, while delivering a return for our shareholders and investing in innovation to accelerate the Think Forward strategy.\n\nIn 2020, ING changed its CET1 ambition from around 13.5 percent to around 12.5 percent, reflecting among others a structural reduction of capital requirements and increased visibility of expected regulatory risk-weighted assets inflation. This new ambition level is comfortably above the current maximum distributable amount (MDA) level of 10.51 percent, implying a management buffer of ~200 basis points. ING also changed its dividend policy from a progressive dividend to a pay-out ratio of 50 percent of resilient net profit (which is defined as net profit adjusted for significant items not linked to the normal course of business) and additional return of structural excess capital.\n\nOur capital position improved in 2020, despite the higher risk costs due to the Covid19 pandemic. ING's CET1 ratio was 15.5 percent at the end of 2020, up from 14.6 percent at end-2019, which is well above our new CET1 ratio ambition of around 12.5 percent. The CET1 ratio at the end of the year improved primarily due lower risk-weighted assets (RWA). The decrease RWA was mainly due to lower volumes, foreign exchange movements and a better overall profile of the loan book. On the latter, downward rating adjustments were more than offset by higher and additional collateral value.\n\nING Group has a leverage ratio of 4.8 percent, which is temporarily higher as the European Central Bank has authorised the exclusion of certain central bank exposures (\u20ac98.3 billion) until June 2021. Without the exclusion, the leverage ratio was 4.4 percent at the end of 2020, which is still well above our ambition level of >4 percent.\n\nIn 2020, ING issued US$750 million and redeemed US$1.7 billion in additional Tier 1 securities. Furthermore, a total of \u20ac1.5 billion of Tier 2 bonds were issued and US$1.2 b illion of Tier 2 securities were redeemed in 2020. At yearend 2020, ING's total capital ratio was at 20.1 percent. With an AT1 ratio of 1.9 percent and a Tier 2 ratio of 2.8 percent, we benefit fully from the CET1 relief provided by Art.104a in CRD V. Further to these instruments, to build up our minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) capacity, ING Group issued multiple Senior HoldCo transactions in 2020 for a total amount of about \u20ac2.2 billion.\n\nING's profit generating capacity was impacted by higher risk costs due to the pandemic, higher impairments and lower net interest income. After dividend reserving in line with the new dividend policy, we included about \u20ac1.0 billion of profit to our capital base.",

However, the net result fell 31.8 percent to \u20ac2,281 million from \u20ac3,347 million in 2019, strongly affected by the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic , which resulted in higher risk costs reflecting the worsened macroeconomic environment, as well as by impairments in both income and expenses, and some other incidental items.\n\nThe result before tax declined 29.4 percent to \u20ac3,348 million. Income declined by \u20ac217 million, or 1.7 percent, including a \u20ac230 million impairment on ING's equity stake in TMB. Excluding this impairment, income rose 0.1 percent, as higher fee income and increased Treasury-related revenues were offset by margin pressure on savi ngs and current accounts. In 2020, total customer lending declined by \u20ac0.3 billion to \u20ac436.8 billion. Adjusted for currency impacts, Treasury and the WestlandUtrecht Bank (WUB) runoff portfolio, Retail's net core lending book grew by \u20ac2.4 billion as growt h in mortgages more than offset a decline in business lending. Net customer deposits (also adjusted for Treasury and currency impacts) grew by \u20ac37.0 billion in 2020.\n\nOperating expenses increased by \u20ac443 million. This was for \u20ac281 million caused by inciden tal items in 2020, mainly reflecting impairments and restructuring provisions related to the Maggie programme and our retail branch network as well as a goodwill impairment in Retail Belgium. Furthermore, expenses rose mainly due to higher regulatory costs, the impact of collective labour agreement (CLA) salary increases and higher IT expenses, partly offset by lower marketing and travel expenses. The cost/income ratio was 61.8 percent in 2020, compared with 57.1 percent in 2019.\n\nRisk costs rose to \u20ac1,322 million, or 30 basis points of average customer lending, from \u20ac588 million, or 14 basis points, in 2019. Risk costs in 2020 included \u20ac398 million of collective provisions related to the worsened macroeconomic indicators, including management adjustments to reflect a delay in observed defaults that are still expected and provisioning related to loans subject to a payment holiday.\n\n## Market Leaders\n\n## Retail Netherlands\n\nThe result before tax of Retail Netherlands decreased 5.7 percent to \u20ac2,078 million from \u20ac2,204 million in 2019. This decline was mainly attributable to higher risk costs reflecting the worsened macroeconomic environment and an increase in regulatory costs.\n\nTotal income declined by \u20ac34 million, or -0.8 percent, to \u20ac4,471 million, compared with \u20ac4,505 million in 2019. Net interest income declined 0.8 percent, mainly due to lower margins on savings and current accounts, combined with a decline in average lending volumes, which was largely offset by higher Treasuryrelated revenues. Net core lending (which excludes Treasury products and a \u20ac1.1 billion decline in the WUB runoff portfolio) decreased by \u20ac3.2 billion in 2020, of which \u20ac0.8 billion was in residential mortgages and \u20ac2.4 billion in other lending. Net cust omer deposits (excluding Treasury) grew by \u20ac15.3 billion, predominantly in current accounts. Net fee and commission income increased by \u20ac7 million, or 1.0 percent, primarily due to higher investment product fees. Investment and other income was \u20ac11 million lower.\n\nOperating expenses rose by \u20ac26 million, or 1.2 percent, to \u20ac2,236 million from \u20ac2,210 million in 2019, of which \u20ac65 million was caused by higher regulatory costs. Expenses excluding regulatory costs declined 1.9 percent as the impact of CLA salary increases, higher IT expenses as well as provisions related to redundancies and customer claims, were more than offset by lower external staff costs and lower marketing and travel expenses.\n\nThe net addition to loan loss provisions was \u20ac157 million, or 10 basis points of average customer lending, compared with \u20ac91 million, or 6 basis points, in 2019. Risk costs in 2020 included \u20ac118 million of collective provisions related to the worsened macroeconomic indicators, including provisioning related to loans subject to a payment holiday.",

We had to respond quickly to assure the safety of our employees and the continuity of operations for 1.3 million Italian customers. I worked practically non-stop for a month. My four-year-old daughter now says 'daddy is working with the ears', as I constantly have headphones on. We actually moved from Milan to a village in the mountains for the lockdown. We stayed there until September; we had to return when the schools started again. Personally, I'm most proud of the birthday party we organised for our eight-year-old daughter, with video call celebrations with her grandparents and great-grandparents in Milan and Russia.

At the same time we strive to provide a differentiating employee experience that keeps people motivated and engaged.\n\n## Covid-19: How we made a difference for our people\n\nCovid-19 has disrupted societies, and it has had a big impact on ING employees across the globe. Business continuity and our ability to keep serving our customers relied on rapidly transforming our way of working into a work-from-home model. This required quickly putting the necessary infrastructure and processes in place to support up to around 80 percent of our global workforce working from home.\n\n## Health and safety first\n\nSince the start of the global pandemic in March our focus has been on keeping our colleagues safe, healthy and supported. We set up a global steering group and local crisis management teams at ING locations, which strived to follow the highest health and safety standards.

Social distancing guidelines and enhanced health and hygiene measures apply to desks, meeting rooms and common areas. We strive to uphold high health and safety standards and follow local government advice on coronavirus prevention measures.\n\n## Learning and staying vital\n\nING believes people need to stay vital to be at their best in their job. This was even more important during the long months of working under difficult circumstances in 2020. Supporting and safeguarding the wellbeing of our employees and managers was of crucial importance.\n\nCovid-19 highly disrupted our way of working and added urgency to the need for high adaptability and resilience. Activities were shifted to a virtual working environment, sometimes performed in isolation. Managers were asked to set up virtual team networks to remain close to their employees and to guide and encourage them, leading to different sorts of challenges. Apart from finding new ways to collaborate, they needed to motivate and engage employees from a distance, manage their own vitality, and monitor the wellbeing of colleagues when they couldn't see them every day. We addressed these challenges by offering a wide range of online support tools for all employees and extra coaching for leaders and managers.\n\nOur global Talent and Learning team put in place a number of virtual development and training tools, tailored to the various workforce levels. On top of the coaching already included in the Think Forward Leadership Programme, we offered 400 of our top leaders one-to-one consultation sessions with external wellbeing coaches. We also introduced a virtual version of the Think Forward Leadership Experience (TFLE) programme for people managers with five or more direct reports focusing on the topic of sustained high performance.\n\nWe fully digitalised our development tools for managers, empowering them to drive performance and improve their managerial skills. These tools included additional webinars on topics such as motivating a team from a distance. Around 1,200 managers attended these webinars.\n\nFor employees, a fully digital offering was created with more than 100 tools and resources focused largely on personal effectiveness. Topics included:\n\n- \u00b7 Embracing new working conditions\n- \u00b7 Getting guidance and staying engaged\n- \u00b7 Organising your work and being flexible\n- \u00b7 Asking for and providing feedback\n- \u00b7 Building trust and psychological safety\n- \u00b7 Dealing with change and uncertainty.\n\n## Local wellbeing initiatives\n\nLocal businesses came up with a range of creative solutions to help employees stay strong in difficult times. The support varied from tips and tricks on nutrition and how to stay fit, to online wellbeing coaches, psychological support, tips on how to deal with stress and workload and advice on the importance of taking a holiday -even when your trip is cancelled.\n\nSome examples of the many local initiatives include 'Wellbeing Friday' and a wellness intranet page called Frenkie (Australia), a health week and virtual sports challenges (Poland), a wellbeing handbook and online workouts on emotional and mental health (Romania), online meditation courses and yoga lessons (Italy), personal trainer videos (Germany) and online talks on nutrition, mindfulness and the importance of sleep (Turkey). Employees in the Netherlands and Belgium could follow a newsletter series with expert advice on performing during the coronavirus period. We also launched a series of webinars for employees in the Netherlands and Belgium focused on developing a positive mindset, concentrating under pressure and creating moments of relaxation.",

The WQ programme comprises training courses on energy management, performing under pressure and mental power. Since its launch in Wholesale Banking in 2018, 10,000 people have completed the WQ programme.\n\n## Communicate, communicate\n\nLeaders and managers at all levels stepped up their communication efforts to keep their teams up to date and motivated in uncertain times. As well as virtual stand-ups and other meetings to discuss formal, business-related topics, there were also informal virtual get-togethers, from pub quizzes to wellness workshops and webinars.\n\nInternal communication became vital to keep staff engaged. On global and local intranets and in social communities, people told stories and shared photos and videos of their working from home experiences. E xternal experts featured in an article series on the global intranet, 'Home coach'.\n\n## Continuous listening and organisational health\n\nTo measure the engagement and wellbeing of ING's largely remote workforce during the Covid-19 pandemic, we created frequent, global Quick Pulse surveys. Altogether approximately 42,000 people received the survey, askin g questions such as 'How are you feeling today' , 'What is affecting how you feel' and ' Have you been able to combine your work and private life well today'? The outcomes provided valuable input to sharpen the offering of supportive tools for employees and managers globally and locally.\n\nThese Quick Pulse surveys were run weekly between April and June so that local businesses could quickly address issues as they arose. The surveys continued at a lower frequency throughout the rest of the year to enable the organisation to address the challenges employees were facing. Local support varied from offering online toolkits and workshops on remote working and collaboration to providing ergonomic advice on how to sit and use home office equipment (IT, furniture), mental health support and extending communications efforts to connect managers and their teams. The Quick Pulse survey will continue in its current format in 2021.\n\nWe also measure ING's organisational health in the more extensive Organisational Health Index (OHI) diagnostic survey. The last full survey in September 2019 had shown that our results were declining. Based on this, the Management Board Banking decided to focus our efforts on three priority areas: direction, leadership and innovation & learning. These global themes were the starting point for action plans at local, business and functional levels, which also covered local or business-line issues.\n\nTo monitor the progress on these priorities, we introduced two OHI Pulse surveys for all employees in 2020. The global results of the OHI Pulse survey held in May showed significant improvement across all business lines in the three priority areas. More colleagues indicated ING's purpose is communicated clearly and that they understood more how they contribute to ING's success. More colleagues felt their views were included in decision-making and more felt leaders showed concern for the welfare of employees. Also, more colleagues felt ING was doing well in innovation.\n\nThe outcomes of the OHI Pulse survey in November, compared to May, showed that leaders continued their high level of support and caring for employees' welfare. Scores on direction declined slightly while those on innovation & learning remained generally stable versus May.\n\nThe May and November surveys also included some questions on engagement. The results showed that despite the challenging times, engagement at ING remains high. Comparing the November 2020 scores with those in September 2019, both job engagement (focusing on enjoyment of work) and organisational engagement (looking at pride in ING as a company) increased. Between May and November, the engagement scores remained relatively stable.\n\nThe next full organisational health survey will be run in 2Q 2021.\n\n## Orange Code and Code of Conduct\n\nOur business centres on people and trust. People trust us with their money and with their data. Maintaining this trust is crucial.\n\nEverything we do at ING is guided by the values and behaviours that underpin our way of working. We call this our Orange Code.",

        "page_content": "- > Our people\n\nThe Orange Code is a manifesto that describes our way of working, putting integrity above all. It is comprised of our values and our behaviours.\n\nING values are the principles we stick to, no matter what.\n\nWe are honest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are prudent\n\nWe are responsible\n\nING behaviours are commitments we make to each other and the standards by which we measure each other's performance.\n\nYou take it on and make it happen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou help others to be successful.\n\nYou are always a step ahead.\n\nWe expect everybody to demonstrate our Orange Code behaviours every day. ING colleagues showed this during the crisis by continuing to serve customers from home: they took things on and made them happen. And they helped each other to be successful; for example by supporting colleagues who had to combine work tasks with home schooling. The Orange Code behaviours drive our success.\n\nThe Orange Code values are the promises we make. It's our policy not to ignore, tolerate or excuse any behaviour that is not in line with these values. Doing so could potentially put our customers at risk, erode the public's confidence and damage our reputation. That's why integrity is at the very foundation of our culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, we introduced a global Code of Conduct, which outlines the 10 core principles we expect from employees. These principles build on the values and behaviours of our Orange Code and are based on ING's existing policies, minimum standards and guidelines to keep ING safe, secure and compliant. The global Code of Conduct is in addition to local codes of conduct in various countries. Important elements are the 'speak -up' principle, encouraging employees to report any misconduct, and the principle that every ING employee is entitled to a safe working environment. ING does not tolerate discrimination, harassment, bullying, sexual or other forms of intimidation, aggression or violence.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe promote diversity at ING, not just because it is the right thing to do. We promote diversity because it's essential for delivering on our strategy. To stay a step ahead we need teams with a healthy mix of contrasting perspectives and backgrounds as they are more creative, faster to adapt and more inventive with their solutions. At ING we value inclusion and we encourage people to bring their whole self to work.\n\nWe strive for no group or level to comprise more than 70 percent of the same gender, nationality or age group. Managers are ultimately responsible for building mixed teams and choosing the dimensions of diversity they focus on. They are guided by the 70 percent principle and our global priorities (gender, nationality and age).\n\n## How are we doing?\n\nWhen we look at the overall global make-up of ING we see that collectively we meet the 70 percent across all three dimensions. However, within individual teams and on a country level there are different, often complex challenges in creating the mixed teams we strive for, and we are not always making progress at the speed we would like. Our starting point is fully understanding on an ongoing basis where we are at and where the challenges lie. We have detailed dashboards to help different areas of the business identify gaps and monitor progress towards building mixed teams. These dashboards monitor in real-time how the countries and business lines are doing, at different levels of the organisation. The HR teams use these in their discussions with local management teams.",

        "page_content": "- > Our people\n\n## Diversity at the top\n\nLike many other financial organisations, getting the right mix of people -especially in leadership positions -remains a challenge. There is more to be done to redress imbalances that still exist. ING is committed to making progress in this area.\n\nWhen looking at the composition of our Management Board and Supervisory Board we look at diversity in a broad sense, striving for factors such as nationality, gender, age, education and work background. The diversity and competence matrix in the Supervisory report  reflects the composition of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. For more information, see the Corporate Governance chapter.\n\nAt the level below the Management Board Banking there is still work to be done to make the necessary progress, particularly in terms of gender. At this level, 27 percent of our leaders are female. In terms of nationality we see more diversity at this level with 43 percent of leaders of non-Dutch nationality. We are addressing this as part of our annual talent review process, which aims to create a more balanced pipeline by including more diverse candidates on succession lists for around 400 of our top roles, and through regular discussions around these appointments at Management Board level.\n\nLooking more broadly, the number of female managers remained stable at 37 percent of managers (37 percent in 2019) and 30 percent of managers of managers (29 percent in 2019).\n\n## Inclusion\n\nTo create an environment where people can truly feel free to be themselves and where people decisions are made objectively and fairly, we need to reduce our biases. In July 2020, ING launched a 'Banking on inclusion' training programme for managers and HR professionals. By the end of 2020, 683 ING managers had enrolled in the training. All employees globally could already follow an online unconscious bias e-learning, which was introduced in 2019.\n\nOur 'quality of hire programme' aims to improve the quality of our hiring processes, reducing early turnover and increasing job performance. We have created an evidence-based approach, Hiring 1-2-3, that aims to help us hire the right candidates for ING, reduce biases and prejudices we all have and offer candidates a fair process. The three steps focus only on evidence, to ensure a fair and objective process for every candidate. We work with structured interviews and diverse interview panels, and we calibrate before making a decision. The approach was piloted successfully in Romania, after which it was implemented in five more countries in 2020. Global roll-out will take place in 2021.\n\nAs an inclusive employer, ING wants its benefits to be inclusive as well. In 2020, we performed a worldwide review of our benefits packages. After a first round covering 40 countries, we did a deeper assessment in eight countries, comprising 65 percent of the ING population. In several cases the benefits packages were assessed as 'above -market'. In terms of inclusivity, some themes emerged that we may consider focusing on in the future, including family leave (e.g. equal paternity/maternity leave), financial education and wellbeing.\n\nTo further promote inclusion, ING has more than 20 employee networks and employee-led diversity initiatives. The Lioness network, for instance, is in five countries and aims to help women realise their ambitions. Other networks focus on race and nationality, cultural diversity, employees with a disability, LGBT+ employees and allies, and various age groups.\n\n## Our stance on discrimination\n\nDiscrimination is when a person is treated differently or excluded, for example from a job opportunity, because of their race, gender, religion, cultural background, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, political opinion, family responsibility, age or social origin. It has the effect of nullifying or impairing equal opportunity. ING has measures in place to prevent discrimination towards customers and employees. These include our Global Code of Conduct, which expects all employees to create and maintain a safe working environment and to speak up and report misconduct.\n\nIn 2020, the topics of racial injustice and ethnicity and the Black Lives Matter movement were pushed into the spotlight by incidents and subsequent protests in the US and the rest of the world. To reinforce our position on discrimination, the Management Board Banking shared a global message with all employees in June, denouncing all forms of discrimination and encouraging employees to speak up if they encounter discrimination at work, or behaviour they're not comfortable with.",

        "page_content": "- > Our people\n\nWe make a conscious effort to include all people, no matter what their cultural background, experience, religion, sexual orientation or political viewpoints. Any distinction, exclusion or preference not based on the inherent requirements of the job is deemed to be discrimination. We are working together to create an inclusive workplace and, in turn, play our part in building an inclusive world.\n\nWe have a policy that aims to ensure equal remuneration for men and women doing work of equal value. At the same time, it's important to acknowledge the difference in average pay between genders, and the difference in pay between men and women in the same position adjusted for circumstances like experience. We take into account that the difference in average pay at ING is influenced by the (smaller) number of women in higher management roles.\n\nMore than 10 countries annually -including the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland -review and monitor pay levels from a gender perspective, taking any necessary actions if disparities are identified. While we aspire to conduct this exercise globally in the future, we will need to roll out a consistent job framework model and implement one global HR system across all ING countries before this is possible.\n\n## Performance management\n\nAt ING we manage our people's performance on a continuous basis. Called Step Up, our global performance management practice centres around socalled 'continuous conversations' between employees and their managers. ' C ontinuous conversations' are informal, regular, on -the-job chats between employees and their manager so employees know what they're supposed to do, how they're doing and what they can improve. These discussions should encompass the employee's job, ' stretch ' ambitions and our Orange Code behaviours. In addition to these informal conversations there are also three formal check-ins during the year -target setting, mid-year review and year-end evaluation. When assessing performance, we always encourage manager s to look broadly at an employee's performance, considering all areas affecting their work and home life. With Covid-19 introducing difficult circumstances for many employees -for example, juggling home schooling or caring for relatives while working -this balanced view was particularly relevant this year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Our people\n\nThe Individual Development Plan (IDP), introduced in February 2020, helps employees to work on their personal development needs and ambitions. Employees are encouraged to create their IDP at the beginning of the year and discuss their development on a continuous basis with their manager. Similar to performance management, two formal moments are scheduled at mid-year and year-end to check in on progress.\n\nThe IDP framework enables employees to identify actions to improve their performance in a current role, think ahead about the skills and experiences they might need for a next role, or even beyond that for a role outside ING. The IDP is available in all countries and over a third of all employees have put a plan in place.\n\n## Our people offer\n\nThis year we introduced 'our people offer'. This document based on extensive research -sets out our differentiating offer as an employer in the marketplace and states what we ask of our people in return. Our people offer gives guidance to our global people practices, while supporting our Think Forward s trategy. It replaces the previous 'employer value proposition' and forms the basis of our employer brand.\n\nA total reward statement was introduced in the Netherlands and Belgium, giving employees a full, personal overview of their salary, pension and payments, as well as options available to help them improve their wellbeing and craftmanship.\n\n## Continuous learning and talent development\n\nTo deliver on our purpose and strategy ING needs to have the right capabilities in place. Working with the business, we identified six clear capabilities we need now and in the future to deliver on our business strategy -both as an organisation and as individuals. These six capabilities, collectively known as the ' Big 6 ' capabilities , are important for all ING colleagues irrespective of role, level, country or department.\n\nOur foundational capabilities are those required to get the basics right. These keep us safe, create and maintain trust of our customers, stakeholders and our people. There are three of these: non-financial risk management, cybersecurity and operations management. Data fluency, customer experience and leadership are our three distinctive capabilities. These distinguish ING in the market and are essential for creating value.\n\nThe Big 6 will bring additional focus to both the development needs of the ING workforce and the many learning resources we have available. The capabilities were launched in 2020 in the Netherlands and Belgium, along with a new online learning platform -My Learning. The further roll-out of the Big 6campaign to all employees is planned for 2021.\n\n## My Learning\n\nMy Learning is ING's new intelligent digital learning platform where employees can find our complete offering of learning content in one location. The new platform is live in Netherlands and Belgium and all employees in these countries have access. The roll-out of My Learning to other countries will continue in 2021.\n\nThe platform contains learning activities from ING sources as well as external content libraries, allowing employees to find everything they need in one system. My Learning offers content selected specifically for the user. The better the platform gets to know the employee, the more relevant the recommendations become. These recommendations are based on the role, interests and learning and the search behaviour of the user, as well as that of colleagues with a similar profile.\n\nMy Learning organises search results in channels and so-called learning plans, with learning activities on the same subject being grouped in a channel. Official ING content curated by our learning experts are 'recommended channels' . Employees can also create their own channels.\n\n## Think Forward Leadership programmes\n\nING's Think Forward Leadership Programme (TFLP) aims to develop greater leaders and better managers who can engage staff and enhance team performance. Introduced for senior leaders in 2017, it was extended later that year to people managers globally as the Think Forward Leadership Experience (TFLE), with follow-up learning activities.",

        "page_content": "- > Our people\n\nThe first phase of the programmes focused on self-awareness, personal ownership and collaboration. Other subjects covered were the Orange Code and the Think Forward strategy. Phase 2, launched for TFLP in 2018, focused on sustained high performance, talent development and performance transparency (how can we lead courageously and create a culture of transparency). This was also extended to the TFLE audience in 2020.\n\nThe first full digital version of the TFLE went live in September. The content focused on topics like psychological safety, micro agressions/messages, radical candour and sustainable high performance; priming ourselves and our team for performance. These topics are even more relevant in the context of working from home and the acceleration in change we are all experiencing. In 2020, a total of 840 managers joined these sessions. Feedback was positive with an overall peer recommendation score of 4.2 out of 5 and a 4.6 out of 5 score in response to the question: 'The skills and insights I gained are relevant for leaders at ING'.\n\nING's programme for new managers, or managers who are new to ING, was launched in 2020. The First-Time Leader Programme (FTLP) aims to develop the skills these managers need to help themselves and their teams be successful. Themes include communication, personal development and leading a team. Over 500 people participated in the fully digital programme over the year.\n\nThe FTLP is available to managers and employees who would like to become managers in the future via the ING Learning Centre/MyLearning platform. Participants have access to a range of online resources specially created for them, including training modules, videos and an online library.\n\nThe award-winning Purpose to Impact programme, launched in 2019, helps employees in the Netherlands and Belgium discover their personal purpose, connecting their motivation and unique strengths to the goals of ING.\n\n## Digitalisation: using data to improve the employee experience\n\nWhile in many areas, recruitment was much less of a focus, ING still needs key specialist profiles in some locations to realise our digital ambitions. To improve the way we attract talent we are redesigning our global recruitment operating model, particularly with regards to our sourcing and screening approach for niche or hard-to-fill roles.\n\nOur ambition is to bring our employee experience on a par with our customer experience.  A new survey called the Employee Experience Index\u00a9 was piloted in four countries in 2020 to gain more insight into the touchpoints that impact employee engagement. This will be rolled out to additional countries in 2021 to become a recurring initiative offering actionable insights into the experiences of ING employees throughout the employee lifecycle.\n\nStarting a new job is one of the crucial stages in the employee lifecycle. In 2020, we introduced a digital onboarding tool that guides new hires and their managers through the onboarding journey, helping to make new colleagues feel welcome at a time when they can't meet their teams in person. The tool was launched for ING's shared -services centre in Manila, followed by the Netherlands later in the year.\n\n## A changing organisation\n\n## Looking for a new normal\n\nOverall, the speed with which the ING workforce managed to adapt to a new remote way of working in 2020 was a huge achievement. Of course, given the uncertainty around Covid-19 and how it develops, it's hard t o predict what the future holds. What is clear is that ING will have to learn from these experiences to create a 'new normal' in which we seek to balance the advantages of working from home and working from the office. We are taking a measured step-by-step approach to this, testing and evaluating as we progress -to make sure that we're taking the right decisions each step of the way for employees, our stakeholders and ING as a whole.\n\nAs a starting point we've created a set of guiding principles that describe our global way of working. These principles complement ING's one Way of Working and promote one global standard with a degree of flexibility for local implementation.",

        "page_content": "- > Our people\n\nBased on the initial analysis, we envisage that in the future employees will spend around 50 percent of their time working remotely and will be empowered to work much more flexibly. This is not set in stone, but is an indication of our current thinking and our starting point for the ' new normal ' . It will require re-thinking many aspects of the way we work -for instance office space, collaboration, travel -and it's important we look carefully at this and test initial conclusions before making final decisions and moving forward with the roll-out. In some countries, for example in Spain, Italy and Turkey, colleagues have already been given the flexibility to choose where they want to work, which provided valuable input for the global approach.\n\n## Organisational and people impact\n\nING's ambition to transform into a leading data -driven digital bank remains firm. The challenging external environment requires us to remain flexible in how and where we deliver our Think Forward strategy. At the same time, customer behaviour is changing as we become more digital in our approach to banking. This can impact the way we operate and the skills and capabilities we need. This means we sometimes need to make organisational changes or refocus our activities. These decisions can impact our people and roles can, for example, change or no longer exist.\n\nIn July, ING in the Netherlands announced its intention to close 42 branches over the coming year, moving services to other ING branches or service points. ING in the Netherlands has 134 branch offices and 246 service points (December 2020). In December, ING in Belgium announced plans to close 62 branches out of a branch network of 552 branches (December 2020). This is because we 're seeing customers are increasingly using digital channels rather than visiting our branches. Covid-19 has accelerated these changes and the speed of digitalisation. The vast majority of colleagues affected by the announced changes are expected to find new roles in other parts of our business.\n\nFurthermore, in November we announced we are simplifying the geographical and client footprint of our Wholesale Banking business and stopping the Maggie transformation programme. Refocusing these activities will result in a headcount reduction of approximately 1,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs) mainly over the course of 2021.\n\nDecisions like these are not made lightly. We are committed to treating employees impacted by the changes with respect and care. We aim, as far as possible, to help them develop their skills or find new job opportunities inside and outside ING.",

In March, I home-schooled my two eldest, which mostly meant helping them with homework and keeping their motivation levels up, given they are teenagers. We agreed on specific times during the day when they could ask me questions or discuss any issues they might have. My sixyear-old daughter needs more attention, so sometimes she sits with me du ring the day. It's quite nice -it feels like I have a colleague around. It took some time to adjust. I'm fortunate to have a nanny looking after my three-year-old twins. I'm busy with work calls the whole day so I try to make the most of my 'me time' early in the morning before the 'madness' begins. I listen to music, exercise, read, or simply enjoy my coffee in the garden. It helps me clear my mind and stay sane, which is a relative concept with five children under the age of 14.

The non-financial information in scope is defined on page 15 in the table 'Material Topics 2020' (excluding information related to financial performance); and\n- -  audited the 'Understanding what matters most' section on page 420, the data for the Net Promoter Score for Retail Banking, Feeling of Financial Empowerment and System Availability, as on pages 7, 15, 35, 43, 46, 52 and 420 (hereafter: 'the Four Specific Topics')\n\nof ING Groep N.V. ('ING Group') based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nA review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. An audit engagement is aimed at obtaining reasonable assurance.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Non-Financial Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI') and supplemental reporting criteria as described in the section 'About this report'.\n\nFurthermore, in our opinion the Four Specific Topics are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applied reporting criteria as described in the section 'About this report'.\n\n## Basis for our conclusion on the Non-Financial Information and our opinion on the Four Specific Topics\n\nWe performed our review on the Non-Financial Information and our audit on the Four Specific Topics in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3000A 'Assurance-opdrachten anders dan opdrachten tot controle of beoordeling van historische financi\u00eble informatie (attest-opdrachten)' (assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information (attestation engagements)). Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of ING Group in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' ('ViO', Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence). Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' ('VGBA', Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe believe the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion about the Non-Financial Information and our opinion on the Four Specific Topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics need to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria. ING Group is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting.\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI') and the supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the section 'About this report'.\n\n## Scope of the group examination\n\nING Group is the parent company of a group of entities. The Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics incorporate the consolidated information of this group of entities to the extent as specified in section 'About this report'. Our group assurance procedures consisted of both assurance procedures at ING Group corporate level and at country level. Our selection of countries in scope of our assurance procedures is primarily based on the country's individual contribution to the consolidated information.\n\nBy performing our assurance procedures at country level, together with additional assurance procedures at corporate level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence about ING Group's reported information to provide a conclusion about the Non-Financial Information and an opinion on the Four Specific Topics.\n\n## Limitations to the scope\n\nThe Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics include prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations and risk assessments. Inherent to prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics.\n\nThe references to external sources or websites in the Non-Financial Information are not part of the Non-Financial Information as reviewed by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.\n\n## The Executive Board's Responsibilities for the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics\n\nThe Executive Board of ING Group (hereafter: 'Executive Board') is responsible for the preparation of the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section 'Report content and materiality', including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material topics.\n\nFurthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics to be free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the reporting process of ING Group.",

The level of assurance obtained in review engagements with a limited level of assurance is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in audit engagements.\n\nOur examination on the Four Specific Topics has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or errors and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users taken on the basis of this Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our assurance procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion and opinion.\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere Voorschriften Kwaliteitssystemen' ('NVKS', Regulations for Quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur examination included among others:\n\n- -  performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant social themes and issues, and the characteristics of ING Group;\n- -  evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics. This includes the evaluation of the results of the stakeholders' dialogue and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Executive Board;\n- -  obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the Non-Financial Information and Four Specific Topics, including obtaining a general understanding of internal control relevant to our review on the Non-Financial Information and our audit on the Four Specific Topics;\n- -  identifying areas of the Non-Financial Information and Four Specific Topics with a higher risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;\n- -  designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the Non-Financial Information and Four Specific Topics responsive to this risk analysis. These procedures included among others:\n- \u00b7 interviewing management and relevant staff at corporate level responsible for the non-financial strategy, policy and results;\n- \u00b7 interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data in the Non-Financial Information and Four Specific Topics;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining assurance information that the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics reconcile with underlying records of ING Group;\n- \u00b7 reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation;\n- -  evaluating the consistency of the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics with the information in the Annual Report which is not included in the scope of our review on the Non-Financial Information and our audit on the Four Specific Topics;\n- -  evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics;\n- -  evaluating whether the Non-Financial Information and the Four Specific Topics as a whole, including the disclosures, reflect the purpose of the reporting criteria used.\n\nAdditionally, our audit of the Four Specific Topics included, on top of the above, among others the following procedures:\n\n- -  identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Four Specific Topics, including being misleading or unbalanced, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from errors, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -  obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the Four Specific Topics in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control;\n- -  testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of IT relevant controls for the System Availability indicator;\n- -  evaluating the reliability of external experts in providing input data for the Net Promoter Score and Feeling of Financial Empowerment indicators.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the review and audit, and significant findings that we identify during our review and audit.\n\nAmstelveen, 8 March 2021\n\nKPMG Accountants N.V.

The global economy shrank in 2020 as domestic demand and supply, trade and finance have been severely disrupted. This section explains ING's approach towards risk management and how this was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAs a global financial institution with a strong European base, offering banking services, ING is exposed to a variety of risks. We manage these risks through a comprehensive risk management framework that integrates risk management into daily business activities and strategic planning. This safeguards ING's financial strength and reputation by promoting the identification, measurement and control of risks at all levels of the organisation. Taking measured risks is core to ING's business.\n\nThe risk management function supports the Executive Board in formulating the risk appetite, strategies, policies and limits. It provides review, oversight and support functions throughout ING on riskrelated items. ING's main financial risks exposures are to credit risk (including transfer risk), market risk (including interest rate, equity, real estate, credit spread, and foreign exchange risks), funding and liquidity risk, and business risk. ING is also exposed to non-financial risks such as operational, IT and compliance risks, as well as to model risks. The ING Group chief risk officer (CRO) is also the CRO of ING Bank.\n\nThis section sets out how ING manages its risks on a day-to-day basis. It explains how the risk management function is embedded within the organisation based on the 'three lines of defence' model . It describes the key risks that arise from ING's business m odel and how these are managed by dedicated risk management departments, with various specific areas of expertise. The section provides qualitative and quantitative disclosures about solvency, credit, market, funding and liquidity, ESG, business, operational, IT, compliance and model risks.\n\n## Risk profile\n\nThis chart provides highlevel information on the risks arising from ING's business activities :\n\n## Risk profile\n\nSolvency risk, credit risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, ESG risk, operational risk, IT risk, compliance risk, business risk, model risk\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Risk management at ING Group\n\n## Basis of disclosures (*)\n\nThe risk management section contains information relating to the nature and extent of the risks of financial instruments as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. These disclosures are an integral part of ING Group Consolidated financial statements and are indicated by the symbol (*). Chapters, paragraphs, graphs or tables within the risk management section that are indicated with this symbol in the respective headings or table header are considered to be an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThis risk management section also includes additional disclosures beyond those required by IFRS standards, such as certain legal and regulatory disclosures. Not all information in this section can be reconciled back to the primary financial statements and corresponding notes, as it has been prepared using risk data that differs to the accounting basis of measurement. Examples of such differences include the exclusion of accrued interest and certain costs and fees from risk data, and timing differences in exposure values (IFRS 9 models report expected credit loss on underlying exposures). Disclosures in accordance with Part Eight of the CRR and CRD IV, and as required by the supervisory a uthority, are published in our 'Additional Pillar III Report', which can be found on our corporate website ing.com.\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nThe risks listed below are defined as existing and emerging risks that may have a potentially significant impact on our financial position or our business model. They may have a material impact on the reputation of the company, introduce volatility in future operational results, or impact ING's medium and long-term strategy including the ability to pay dividends, maintain appropriate levels of capital or meet liquidity and funding targets. An emerging risk is defined as a risk that has the potential to have a significant negative effect on our performance, but whose impact on the organisation is currently more difficult to assess than other risk factors that are not identified as emerging risks.\n\nThe topics have emerged as part of the annual risk assessment that is performed as part of the Stress Testing Framework and the Risk Appetite Framework. The sequence in which the risks are presented below is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their financial consequences.\n\nThe 2020 risk assessment confirmed our top and emerging risks. The top risks in 2020 are related to financial crime, cybercrime and a persistent low interest rate environment. On top of that, the Covid-19 pandemic impacted our business environment. Climate change risk remains an important risk, reflecting the impact that climate change may have for the financial position and/or reputation of ING.\n\n## Covid-19 pandemic\n\nCovid-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. Various countries and local governmental authorities across the world have introduced measures aimed at preventing the further spread of Covid-19. Read more in 'The world around us'.\n\nIn addition, governments in various countries have introduced measures aimed at mitigating the economic consequences of the outbreak. For example, the Dutch government has announced economic measures aimed at protecting jobs, households' wages and companie s, e.g., by way of tax payment holidays, guarantee schemes and a compensation scheme for heavily affected sectors in the economy. These announced measures and any additional measures, including any payment holidays with respect to mortgages or other loans, have had and may continue to have a significant impact on ING's customers and other counterparties. Read more in 'Our business' , in 'Credit risk' and in Note 51 'Capital Management' .\n\nThe Covid19 pandemic has affected all of ING's businesses. These effec ts have included increased volatility, widening of credit spreads, and credit deterioration of loans to ING's customers. The 2020 risk costs were impacted by a combination of increased collective provisioning reflecting the worsened macroeconomic indicators and uncertainty, higher individual Stage 3 provisions, negative rating migration and manual overlays to address the risk on payment holidays and for the delay in observed defaults as a result of the Government support measures. Sectors particularly impacted by the Covid19 pandemic were Aviation (Transportation and Logistics), Hospitality and Leisure (Services and Food, Beverages and Personal Care) and Non-food retail (Retail).",

This was especially true during the initial phases of the pandemic, which included high frequency calls between senior management of the bank, as well as with external stakeholders like the ECB, to intensely monitor developments relating to liquidity, market and credit risks. ING also performed several types of stress tests and sectoral reviews to assess the potential impact on its financial position, which helped ING to get further insights into the potential impact and to define appropriate mitigating actions. Read more in 'Credit risk' , 'Market risk' and 'Funding and Liquidity risk' .\n\nING is monitoring the evolving Covid-19 pandemic carefully to understand the impact on its people and business. A central ING team has been set up to monitor the situation globally and provide guidance on health and safety measures, travel advice, and business continuity for our company. In addition, a situation in which most or some of ING's employees continue working from home may raise operational risks, including with respect to information security, data protection, availability of key systems and infrastructure integrity. Read more in 'Non -financial r isk' .\n\nThe duration of the pandemic and the impact of measures taken in response by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties remain uncertain. Recent increases in Covid-19 infection rates amplified uncertainty and affect the recovery path. Potential economic implications for the countries and sectors where ING is active, which could have a material adverse effect on ING's business and operations, are continuously being identified, assessed and monitored in order to execute possible mitigating actions.\n\n## Geopolitical risk\n\nING's business and portfolios are exposed to geopolitical risks such as political instability, social unrest or military conflicts, which could adversely affect our operations. Global tensions over trade, technology and ideology pose challenges and have negative effects for economic growth. The Covid19 pandemic could accelerate and amplify the negative impact, with divergence both between and within countries leading to increased inequality.\n\nThe US-China relationship stands out as an important geopolitical risk, with (related) trade tensions, negatively impacting global growth. Increasing protectionism between key countries could lead to a slowdown in global production and adversely affect global trade and investments.\n\nOn 24 December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union agreed a post-Brexit \"EU-UK Trade and Cooperation\" Agreement (the 'TCA'). The financial services provisions of the TCA are very limited. UK-based financial services providers lost EU passporting rights from 1 January 2021 and EUUK financial services have become subject to unilateral equivalence decisions. The EU and UK regulators have taken measures to address overall financial stability risks (e.g. extension to recognition of UK CCPs).\n\nIN G's Brexit preparations were predicated on a no trade deal outcome and certain business model adaptations have been implemented to ensure the continuity of business post-Brexit. ING was well prepared with both our EU and UK postBrexit authorisations. ECB' s authorisation decision conditions have been met or are on track for their September 2021 due dates. Pending PRA & FCA authorisation decision, UK Temporary Permissions Regime is allowing continuity of UK branch authorisation from 1 January 2021. Some FM trading activities will move from London to Amsterdam as a result of Brexit.\n\nING continuously monitors the developments and outlook in geopolitical risk and assesses what impacts these may have on our portfolios. Internal stress testing and scenario analyses are used to assess the potential impact and adjust the limits to exposures according to our risk appetite.\n\n## Financial economic crime\n\nKnowing who we do business with helps us protect our customers, society and our bank from financial economic crimes (FEC). We believe that as gatekeepers to the financial system we have an obligation to prevent criminals from misusing it, detect misuse where it occurs and respond accordingly. We believe we can be even more effective in safeguarding the financial system if we join forces and work with other banks and with national, European and global authorities and law enforcement agencies to tackle financial economic crime. In 2020, ING continued to execute and update policies and procedures to further enhance our know your customer (KYC) activities. In addition, ING set up a special taskforce to monitor transactions for financial economic crime related to Covid-19.",

Both the frequency and the intensity of attacks are increasing on a global scale. Threats from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, targeted attacks (also called advanced persistent threats) and ransomware have intensified worldwide.\n\nING builds on its cybercrime resilience through its dedicated Cyber Crime Expertise and Response Team, further enhancing the control environment to protect from, and detect and respond to, ebanking fraud, DDoS and targeted attacks. Controls and monitoring continue to be embedded in the organisation as part of the overall internal control framework and are continuously re-assessed against existing and new threats. The identification and monitoring of new threat actors and campaigns relevant to ING inform this process as does closer alignment between IT security and fraud teams. In addition, ING continues to strengthen its global cybercrime and fraud resilience through extensive collaboration with financial industry peers, law enforcement authorities, government (e.g. National Cybersecurity Center) and internet service providers (ISPs).\n\n## Data management\n\nING is using a large number of systems and applications to support key business processes and operations to best focus on our customers and their needs. The reconciliation of multiple data sources and the protection of customer data are regarded as crucial processes in ING, and further spurred by its strategic focus on digital service delivery, technology and innovation. We depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. ING is also subject to increasing regulatory requirements including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS 239) principles. ING is continuing to improve data governance, execute data-quality framework controls consistently across the Bank and prioritising implementation of the target infrastructure to further simplify, standardise and modernise its activities.\n\n## Low/negative interest rate environment\n\nThe persistent low/negative interest rate environment, with central banks holding their rates at negative levels in most countries, continued to negatively impact short-term as well as long-term market rates. The Covid-19 pandemic intensified the low/negative interest rate environment and it is expected to remain at this level for some time. This is posing a challenge for bank business models that earn income from net interest income from traditional savings activities. In addition, loans are being repriced at lower rates which is putting more pressure on margins and impacting long-term profitability. ING is continuously assessing this market environment. ING has introduced negative charging and is reducing thresholds for charging negative rates. Further, ING is expanding other sources of income such as net fee and commission income.\n\n## Climate change risk\n\nING is increasingly aware of the risks associated with climate change. This includes physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk can be acute, such as flood and wildfires, or chronic, such as increase in temperature and sea level rise. Transition risk can be driven by policy, technological or market changes occurring as we shift towards a low-carbon global economy and potentially lead to stranded assets.\n\nIn addition to our Climate Expert Group (CEG), in 2020 we established an internal climate risk working group to address the impacts resulting from climate change as part of a bank-wide approach. As such, climate should be considered to be included in our risk management framework and integrated into a forward-looking approach. Our Climate Risk Report 2020 details our approach and sector-specific insights.\n\n## Risk governance (*)\n\nEffective risk management requires firmwide risk governance. ING's risk and control structure is based on the 'three lines of defence' governance model. Each line has a specific role and defined responsibilities, with the execution of tasks being distinct from the control of these same tasks. The three lines work closely together to identify, assess, and mitigate risks.",

The MBB is composed of the Executive Board of ING Group, the heads of the business lines and the chief operating officer.\n\nThe heads of ING's banki ng business and support functions and the heads of the country units, or their delegates, are the first line of defence. They have the primary ownership, accountability and responsibility for assessing, controlling and mitigating all financial and non-financial risks affecting their businesses, and, for the completeness and accuracy of the financial statements and risk reports with respect to their responsible areas. The COO is responsible and accountable for proper security and controls on global applications and IT platforms servicing the Bank and implementing proper processes.\n\nThe second line of defence consists of oversight and specialised functions in risk management and compliance. They (i) have co-responsibility for risk management, through articulating and translating the risk appetite into methodologies and policies to support and monitor business management's control of risk, (ii) objectively challenge risk management execution and control processes and coordinate the reporting of risks and controls by the first line of defence, (iii) advise management on risk management and compliance and have decision-making power in relation to business activities that are judged to present unacceptable risks to ING and (iv) can set minimum requirements in terms of quality and quantity of global resourcing in the risk management and compliance functions.\n\nThe internal audit function forms the third line of defence. It provides an independent assessment of the effectivenes s of internal controls over the risks to ING's business processes and assets, including risk management activities performed in both the first and second lines of defence. To protect its independent nature, decisions regarding the appointment, re-appointment or dismissal from office as well as the remuneration package of the head of the internal audit function require Supervisory Board approval.\n\nThe next graph illustrates the different key senior management level committees in place in the risk governance structure.\n\n(*)\n\n## Risk governance\n\n| SB Level                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Supervisory board Risk committee                                    | tur e          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Executive  Level Management board  CRO                                                                                                                                                                               | 2 - ti er  b o a r d  s tr u c                                      |                |\n| Risk committees Global Credit and Trading Policy Committee  Global Credit Committee  -  Transaction Approval  Asset and Liability Committee Bank  Non-Financial Risk Committee Bank  Model Risk Management Committee |                                                                     | Internal audit |\n| Regional  and BU level BU line management,  regional and   local managers                                                                                                                                            | Local and regional  risk committee  Regional and   BU risk managers | Internal audit |",

For risk management purposes the SB is advised mainly by the Risk Committee, which assists and advises in monitoring the risk profile and approving the overarching risk appetite of the company as well as the structure and effective operation of the internal risk management and control systems.\n- \u25aa The EB is responsible for managing risks associated with all activities of ING Group, whereas the MBB is responsible for managing risks associated with all activities of ING Bank. The EB and MBB responsibilities include ensuring that internal risk management and control systems are effective and that ING Group and ING Bank comply with relevant legislation and regulations. On a regular basis, the EB and MBB report on these issues and discuss the internal risk management and control systems with the SB. On a quarterly basis, the EB and MBB report on ING's risk profile versus its risk appetite to the Risk Committee, explaining changes in the risk profile.\n\nAs a member of the EB and the MBB, the CRO is responsible for ensuring that risk management issues are heard and discussed at the highest level. The CRO steers a risk organisation both at head-office and business-unit levels, which participates in commercial decision-making, bringing countervailing power to keep the risk profile within the agreed risk tolerance. The CRO reports to the SB committee on ING's risk appetite levels and on ING's risk profile at least quarterly. In addition, the CRO briefs them on developments in internal and external risk-related issues and seeks to ensure they understand specific risk concepts.\n\n## Executive level  (*)\n\nThe key risk committees described below act within the overall risk policy and delegated authorities granted by the MBB:\n\n- \u25aa Global Credit and Trading Policy Committee (GCTP) discusses and approves policies, methodologies, and procedures related to credit, trading, country, and reputation (i.e. environmental and social risk or ESR) risks. The GCTP meets on a monthly basis.

They are accountable for the implementation and execution of appropriate risk frameworks affecting their businesses in order to comply with procedures and processes at the corporate level. Where necessary, the implementation is adapted to local requirements. The regional and/or business unit CROs are involved in these activities. The local (regional and BU) CRO is responsible for the analysis, monitoring and management of risks across the whole value chain (from front to back office). The local risks are discussed in local risk committees that roll up to the key risk committees at executive level. Local Client Integrity Risk Committees (CIRCs) assess client integrity risk and they have a final decision on client acceptance or client off-boarding, from a risk-based perspective, in the areas of financial economic crime (FEC), Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and environmental and social risk (ESR).\n\n## Organisational structure (*)\n\nOver the past years, banks have been faced with regulatory and public pressure with regard to their risk management policies, processes and systems. A raft of new requirements and regulations has been introduced and implemented.

The ICF includes binding principles, definitions, process steps, and roles and responsibilities to create consistent bank-wide policies and control standards.\n\nGlobal policies and control standards are developed and maintained or updated within the ICF. These global documents are designed by head-office functions and are to be adhered to by all ING entities and support functions.

Global policy and control standard documents are approved by relevant approval bodies (e.g. Supervisory Board, Executive Board, Managing Banking Board and Bank Non-Financial Risk Committee).\n\nThe policies are based on the risk taxonomy, which is designed to prevent overlaps in policy control objectives. The control standard owners are responsible for defining the key controls that mitigate the significant inherent risks in the business processes. The ICF aims to achieve single key-control testing for multiple purposes, where controls mitigate more than one risk.\n\nThe process of developing policy and process control standard documents includes the following steps: identify the document owner, determine the relevant stakeholders, define a risk-based approach, perform an impact assessment, involve relevant stakeholders and (local) entities for sounding on key and expected controls, and determine an approval body. This overall process is currently being further strengthened by implementing an updated Regulatory Management Process also covering horizon scanning.\n\nAt the end of 2019, the ICF gatekeeper function was split into a first and a second LoD gatekeeper function. The 2nd LoD gatekeeper oversees the policy design process, while the first LoD gatekeeper oversees the design process for the process control standard. The principal role of these gatekeepers is to provide quality assurance and to advise on the relevant approval bodies. The ICF gatekeepers challenge document owners on the alignment of internal control documents with the agreed methodology and risk taxonomy, and verify that the development and communication of those documents are in line with the agreed process.\n\nAll policies, control standards, and procedures are published on ING's intranet. New and updated documents are periodically communicated by means of a dedicated policy update bulletin to the country managers and senior heads of business departments.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nAt ING we attach great importance to a sound risk culture, which is essential for performing our role in society responsibly and to keep the bank safe, secure and compliant. Our risk culture determines the way in which employees identify, understand, discuss, and act on the risks we are confronted with and the risks we take. In 2020, we conducted a self-assessment of our risk culture and are working on developing our envisaged risk culture, built on the foundation of our Orange Code and Global Code of Conduct, and in line with our Think Forward strategy.\n\nTo support ING's ambition to safeguard a sound risk culture, several enhancement projects are ongoing in areas such as our approach to monitoring risk culture, our escalation behaviour and further linking non-financial risk related topics to our purpose and strategy.",

In February 2020 ING launched a new global Code of Conduct linking the Orange Code to its main ING policies, minimum standards and guidelines. In addition to the Orange Code, it further defines the most essential conduct principles expected from ING employees in their daily activities, to create additional risk awareness and better meet expectations stated in external rules and guidelines. Additional ly, the global Code of Conduct will be linked to the employees' performance management cycle to ensure continuous attention to the Global Code of Conduct, and dialogue on how to apply it in the daily work practice of our employees.\n\nThe Orange Code is a declaration of who we are. It describes what we can expect from each other when we turn up to work each day. It is a set of standards that we collectively value, strive to live up to, and invite others to measure us by.\n\nThe Orange Code is the sum of two parts, the ING values and ING behaviours, with integrity being the overarching principle. The ING values (being honest, prudent and responsible) are designed to be nonnegotiable promises we make to the world, principles we seek to stick to, no matter what. The ING behaviours (take it on and make it happen, help others to be successful, and always be a step ahead) represent our way to differentiate ourselves. The Orange Code is embedded in commitments we make to each other and the standards by which we will m easure each other's performance.\n\nTo reinforce the values and behaviours in our Orange Code, which puts integrity above all, we invite all (new) employees to participate in e-learnings that aim to equip them to make the right decisions when faced with a dilemma or issue. In 2020, we developed and rolled out new e-learnings on the Global Code of Conduct, Sanctions, Getting Data Protection Right and Keeping up with KYC.\n\n## Orange Code decision-making\n\nTo enhance risk awareness, we continued to support monitoring risk culture and compliance risk in the business. This included training by compliance and data experts to enhance balanced decision-making in line with the Orange Code decision-making model (introduced in 2017) to support moral learning and well-balanced decision-making. This four-step model helps to delay judgement and aims to find out where the moral weight lies for a potential decision.\n\nThe model is already embedded in some decision-making processes (such as the data ethics governance process and the global Product Approval and Review Process policy) and we are exploring how to embed it in other decisive governance processes within the bank. Compliance is continuing to train experts in this area within the local Compliance teams  to support the organisation in properly applying the model in practice in their respective countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global data ethics\n\nData ethics is key for an enhanced and sustainable trusted relationship with ING customers and society. Our vision is to integrate data ethics as part of our culture, behaviours and decision-making process. We have defined values that should guide our employees' behaviours. Furthermore , we have set up data ethics councils that help ensure we use data responsibly.\n\n## Learning\n\nIn 2020 we continued to strengthen and expand our learning offering on risk topics and the governance around this. The learning focuses on compliance, non-financial risk and risk.",

This will ensure improved learner engagement, bank-wide alignment, and connection between learning, business impact and management actions and also improved feedback and evidencing of outputs. The board brings together content owners, learning experts and corporate communications teams to ensure the best fit for the training need.\n\nWe also took steps to expand our learning for risk professionals, with the Risk Academy which provides focused learning for Risk staff. These take the form of various online learning modules  and frameworks that support employees  in developing their knowledge, skills and behaviours.\n\n## Banker's Oath\n\nIn the Netherlands, all employees of ING take the Banker's Oath and pledge this in a meaningful ceremony. The oath came into force in the Netherlands on 1 April 2015 as part of a joint approach from all banks. The introduction of social regulations, the revision of the Dutch Banking Code, and the implementation of the Banker's Oath (with the associated rules of conduct and disciplinary law), are a way for Dutch banks to show society what they stand for and are accountable for, both as individual banks and as a sector. In 2020, due to the Covid19 crisis, ING NL developed a virtual Banker's Oath ceremony via Skype/Teams -in addition to the physical one -to ensure that all new employees (around 400 a month) can still take the Banker's Oath in time ly fashion and in a meaningful ceremony. Before taking the oath, its importance is discussed, as well as dilemmas employees may come across in their daily work, to ensure a careful balancing of the interests of all our stakeholders, in the decisions they make. In 2020 , the whole Banker's Oath programme was revised and updated, to keep it aligned with the current external circumstances as well as with ING's do your thing branding .\n\n## Remuneration\n\nING aims to align its remuneration policy with its risk profile and the interests of all stakeholders. For more information on ING's compensation and benefits policies and its relation to the risk taken, please refer to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) Remuneration Disclosure published on the corporate website ing.com.\n\n## Centre of Expertise on Behavioural Risk Management (BRM)\n\nBehavioural risk is an increasingly important risk area for ING and across the financial industry. It arises when behavioural patterns are at the root of financial and non-financial risks in the organisation.\n\nThe complexity of this type of risk is that it is less tangible compared to other risk areas because it focuses on behavioural patterns and their drivers. Patterns in how decisions are made, how people communicate and whether they can take ownership. Behaviour is driven by formal and informal mechanisms. Examples of formal drivers are the processes ING applies and how its governance is structured. Informal drivers are less tangible, such as group dynamics or underlying beliefs that influence behaviour.\n\nAt ING, behavioural risk management (BRM) is positioned in the second line of defence, reporting directly to the CRO. The global BRM Centre of Expertise not only assesses behavioural risk in the organisation, but also has the mandate to direct, challenge and support business owners to intervene on behavioural patterns and their underlying drivers.\n\n## Behavioural risk assessments\n\nBehavioural risk assessments (BRAs) identify and analyse undesired behaviours within ING and provide management with specific direction on how to change these behaviours. They focus on the effectiveness of groups rather than individuals, the role of leadership and on less visible aspects such as team dynamics and unwritten social norms. The goal is to understand and systematically assess what drives undesired habits at ING. The BRM model of behavioural risk is used as the standard across ING to signal behavioural risks going forward.\n\n## Behavioural risk interventions\n\nBased on the results of the executed behavioural risk assessments (BRAs), BRM mitigates behavioural risk in a focused manner. Effective mitigation requires a deep understanding of what drives undesired behaviours. Theory and evidence-based techniques and tools developed in behavioural science play an important role in designing and evaluating interventions. Given the crucial role of leaders in creating the right conditions for employees, interventions are first initiated at leadership level. These include leadership labs, which address topics such as 'connection, alignment and trust', as well as bringing together the 'whole system in the room'. Here senior leaders delve into the outcomes of the assessments, identifying deeply rooted and often complex issues for improvement.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk management at ING Group\n\n## Risk identification\n\nRisk identification is a joint effort of the business and the risk management functions. Its goal is to detect potential new risks and determine changes in known risks. Regular risk identification is essential for effective risk management. Potential risks that are not identified, will not be controlled and monitored and may lead to surprises later. Known risks may have changed over time and as a consequence the existing mitigating measures and monitoring may be inadequate or obsolete.\n\nRisk identification is performed periodically. In case of material internal or external change, additional ad hoc risk identification can be performed.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nEach identified risk is assessed qualitatively or quantitatively to determine its importance. This enables ING to decide which of the identified risks need control measures and how strict or tolerant these measures should be. Known risks are re-assessed to detect any change in the risk level.\n\nThe importance of a risk is based on both the likelihood that the risk materialises and the subsequent financial or reputational impact that may occur should the risk arise. Unlikely risks with a potentially high impact need to be controlled. A risk that is likely to happen regularly but expected to have a modest financial impact may not need to be mitigated if the consequences are accepted by management.\n\n## Risk control\n\nRisks can be controlled by mitigating measures that lower the likelihood the risk occurs, lower the impact when it occurs or both. The ultimate measure to lower a risk is to stop the activity or service that causes the risk (risk avoidance). Risk control and mitigation measures are defined and maintained at both the bank-wide and local level.\n\n## Monitoring and reporting\n\nING monitors the risk-control measures by checking if they are executed, complied with and have the expected mitigating effects and by following the development of the risks and their risk levels. Risk reporting provides senior and local management with the information they need to manage risks.\n\nIn addition, interventions are also set in motion that focus on enabling employees to build awareness on behavioural risk and support them in initiating solutions to mitigate the potential behavioural risks. After each assessment the results are shared with the management teams of the assessed units and with the participants of the BRA in a socalled 'feedback session'. This feedback session is followed up with a dialogue starter toolkit, enabling teams to reflect on the results, discuss opportunities for improvement and call for first steps towards sustainable solutions.\n\nA 'nudge lab' can be organised to co-create effective nudges (i.e. a gentle push in the right direction, based on behavioural insight) for solutions to issues that were identified during a BRA. The solutions that have been developed are now being scaled up globally.\n\nThe BRM team works closely with the business units and departments such as HR, Audit, and Compliance to align on and embed desired leadership and risk behaviours (i.e. speak up, psychological safety, communication, guiding leadership).\n\n## Risk cycle process\n\nING uses a step-by-step risk management approach to identify, manage and mitigate its financial and non-financial risks. The approach consists of a cycle of five recurrent activities: risk identification, risk assessment, risk control, risk monitoring, and risk reporting. The cycle is designed to determine what the risks are, assess which of these risks can really do harm, take mitigating measures to control these risks, monitor the development of the risk to see if the measures taken are effective, and report the findings to management at all relevant levels to enable them to take action when needed.\n\nThe cycle recurs in two ways. First, the identification, assessment, review, and update of mitigating measures are repeated periodically. Second, this periodic monitoring exercise may indicate emerging risks, known risks that are changing, risk levels that are changing, or current control measures that are not effective enough. Further analyses of these findings may then result in renewed and more frequent risk identification, and/or assessment, and/or change of mitigating measures.",

Its objective is to set the appropriate risk appetite at the consolidated level across the different risk categories and to allocate the risk appetite throughout the organisation.\n\n## Policy\n\nThe RAF policy states the overarching global risk appetite. Within the RAF, ING monitors a range of financial and non-financial risk metrics to ensure that our risk profile is in line with our risk appetite while executing our strategy. ING's RAF, which is approved by the Supervisory Board (SB), defines the desired risk profile that is to be integrated in the strategic decision-making and financial planning process. It is designed to be able to withstand market volatility and stress, while meeting regulatory requirements. The framework, including underlying assumptions and metrics, is regularly reviewed so that it remains relevant. The RAF combines various financial and non-financial risk appetite statements (RASs) into a single, coordinated approach to provide the business with a clear overview of the relevant risks and the tools to manage them. This view allows the Executive Board (EB), the Management Board Banking (MBB) and senior management to form an opinion on the adequacy of internal risk management and control systems for the risks ING faces while pursuing its strategy.\n\n## Process\n\nThe RAF is focused on setting the risk appetite at the consolidated level and across the different risk categories, and provides the principles for cascading this risk appetite down into the organisation. The RAF and underlying limit allocation are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, based on their quarterly review in the EB, the MBB and the SB. It is therefore a top-down process, which bases itself on the ambition of the bank in terms of its risk profile, the regulatory environment and the economic context. The set of limits used is split according to the approval levels needed for them. Limits that need SB approval are called boundaries and the underlying metrics supporting the boundaries which need EB and MBB approval are called instruments. Since the outbreak of the Covid19 virus, ING re-assessed its risk appetite to take into account the potential impact of the virus and the uncertainties caused by the virus.\n\n## Risk appetite framework process\n\n## Identify and assess risks\n\n- \u00b7 Survey\n- \u00b7 Interviews\n- \u00b7 Risk matrix\n\nDefine underlying risk limits\n\n- \u00b7 Solvency and profitability RAS\n- \u00b7 Credit risk RAS\n- \u00b7 Market risk trading book RAS\n- \u00b7 Market risk banking book RAS\n- \u00b7 Non-financial RAS\n- \u00b7 Business risk RAS\n\nGCTP, ALCO bank, NFRC approval\n\n## Monitor and manage risk limits\n\n- \u00b7 Quarterly risk update\n- \u00b7 Quarterly review cycle\n- \u00b7 Stress testing\n- \u00b7 Recovery plan\n- \u00b7 Management buffer\n\n## Defi ne overarching risk appetite\n\n- ING Group risk appetite framework\n- \u00b7 Approve governance framework\n- \u00b7 Set overarching RAS: solvency, liquidity, funding and concentration\n- \u00b7 SB: approve boundaries\n- \u00b7 MBB/EB: approve instruments\n- Annual MBB and SB approval",

Identify and assess ING's key risks\n\nThe outcome of the risk identification and risk assessment process is used as the starting point for the review of the RAF. Within this step, the risks ING faces when executing its strategy are identified in the context of the current economic, political, regulatory and technological environment. The assessment identif ies whether the potential impact is material and if it is sufficiently controlled within ING's risk management function. It benchmarks the current risk framework against regulatory developments. Known risks are re-assessed either to confirm risk levels or to take account of potential changes. The assessment is contextualised by the current set of risk appetite statements.\n\n## Step 2. Set Risk Appetite Framework\n\nBased on ING's risk assessment and risk purpose, boundar ies for the overarching risk frameworks are set. Once the overarching risk appetite thresholds have been set and approved by EB/MBB and subsequently by SB, the statements are translated into risk-type-specific statements and lower level thresholds which are set and approved by senior risk committees, ALCO Bank, GCTP and Bank NFRC. Cascading is done via a number of detailed risk appetite statements which have been defined per risk type, the combination of which ensures compliance with the overarching Solvency, Concentration and Funding and Liquidity RASs.\n\n## Step 3. Cascade into statements per risk type and business unit\n\nThe bank-wide risk appetite is translated per risk type, which is further cascaded into the organisation to the lowest level. Risk appetite statements are then translated into dedicated underlying risk limits that are used for the day-today monitoring and management of ING's risks. The risk appetite statements serve as inputs for the quarterly planning process as well as for the establishment of key performance indicators and targets for senior management.\n\n## Risk appetite framework policy\n\n<!-- image -->",

Monitor and manage underlying risk limits\n\nIn order to verify that it remains within the Risk Appetite Framework, ING reports its risk positions vis-\u00e0vis its limits on a regular basis to senior management committees. The Quarterly Risk Update reflecting the exposure of ING against the risk appetite is submitted quarterly to the EB and the MBB and to the (Risk Committee of the) SB. Moreover every quarter the financial plan is checked for potential limit breaches within a one-year horizon, where in the strategic dialogue the MBB can take mitigating measures or adjustments to the dynamic plan can be made.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important risk management tool that provides input for strategic decisions and capital planning. The purpose of stress testing is to assess the impact of plausible but severe stress scenarios on ING's capital and liquidity position. Stress tests provide complementary and forwardlooking insights into the vulnerabilities of certain portfolios, with regards to adverse macroeconomic circumstances, stressed financial markets, and changes in the (geo)political climate. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, ING assessed the potential impact on its financial position via different types of stress tests. In addition to assessing P&L, capital and liquidity position of ING for a range of different scenarios, idiosyncratic risks were also included. The outcome of these Covid-19 stress tests helped management to get insight into the potential impact and to define actions to mitigate this potential impact.\n\n## Types of stress tests\n\nWithin ING, different types of stress tests are performed. The most comprehensive type of stress tests are the firm-wide scenario analyses, which involve setting scenario assumptions for all the relevant macroeconomic and financial market variables in all countries relevant to ING. These assumptions usually follow a qualitative narrative that provides a background to the scenario. In addition to firmwide scenario analyses, ING executes scenario analyses for specific countries or portfolios. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are performed, which focus on stressing one or more risk drivers; usually without an underlying scenario narrative. Finally, ING performs reverse stress tests, which aim to determine scenarios that could lead to a pre-defined severe adverse outcome.",

It provides a description of the main risks and risk drivers related to the nature of ING's business, activities and vulnerabilities.\n- \uf0a0 Scenario definition and parameterisation: Based on the outcome of the previous step, a set of scenarios is determined with the relevant scope and set of risk drivers for each scenario, as well as its severity, the key assumptions and input parameters. The output of this phase includes a quantitative description of the stress scenarios to be analysed, the relevant output metrics and, when applicable, a narrative description.\n- \uf0a0 Impact calculation and aggregation: Based on the quantitative description of the stress scenarios determined in the previous step, the impact is determined for the relevant scenario, scope and horizon. The impact calculation and aggregation can be part of a recurring process or part of a specific process set-up for one-off stress tests.\n- \uf0a0 Scenario reporting: For each stress test, a report is prepared after each calculation which describes the results of the scenario, and gives a recap of the scenario with its main assumptions and parameters. The stress test report is sent to the relevant risk committees and/or senior management. It is complemented, if needed, with advice for management action based on the stress testing results.\n- \uf0a0 Scenario control and management assessment: Depending on the outcomes of the stress test and the likelihood of the scenario, mitigating actions may be proposed. Mitigating actions may include, but are not limited to, sales or transfers of assets and reductions of risk limits.\n\n## Methodology\n\nDetailed and comprehensive models are used to calculate the impact of the scenarios. In these models, statistical analysis is combined with expert opinion to make sure that the results adequately reflect the scenario assumptions. The methodologies are granular and portfolio-specific and use different macroeconomic and market variables as input variables. The calculations are in line with our accounting and regulatory reporting frameworks. The stress-testing models are subject to review by Model Risk Management.\n\n## Developments in the regulatory environment\n\n## CRRII/CRDV and BRRDII\n\nOn 27 June 2019, a series of measures referred to as the Banking Reform Package (including certain amendments to CRR and CRDIV commonly referred to as 'CRR II' and CRD V') came into force, su bject to various transitional and staged timetables. The adoption of the Banking Reform Package concluded a process that began in November 2016 and marks an important step toward the completion of the European post-crisis regulatory reforms, drawing on a number of international standards agreed by the Basel Committee, the Financial Stability Board and the G20. CRDV was implemented in Dutch law in 2020. The Banking Reform Package updates the framework of harmonized rules established following the financial crisis of 2008 and introduces changes to the CRR, CRDIV, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR). The Banking Reform Package covers multiple areas, including the Pillar 2 framework, the introduction of a leverage ratio requirement of 3% and a leverage ratio buffer requirement of 50% of the G-SIB buffer requirement (applicable per 1 January 2023), a binding Net Stable Funding (NSFR) ratio based on the Basel NSFR standard but including adjustments with regard to e.g. pass-through models and covered bonds issuance, mandatory restrictions on distributions, permission for reducing own funds and eligible liabilities, macroprudential tools, a new category of 'non -preferred' senior debt, the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) and the integration of the TLAC standard into EU legislation. Further, the EBA obtained a mandate to investigate how to incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks into the supervisory process and what the prudential treatment of assets associated with environmental or social objectives should look like.",

These revisions to Basel III establish new prudential rules for banks, including a revision to the standardised approach to credit risk, the introduction of a capital floor based on standardised approaches, the use of internal models, limitation of options for modelling operating risks, and new rules for the establishment of risk-weighted items and unused credit lines at the banks. Such revisions have a long implementation phase and are not yet fully transposed into EU regulation. The revisions are commonly referred to as \"Basel III Reform\" or \"Basel IV'. In Europe, this will be implemented through the 'CRR III' / 'CRD VI' in the coming years. With this long implementation phase and the transposition into EU regulation still pending, some question marks remain on how this will shape up.\n\n## Targeted review of internal models\n\nIn order to make capital levels more comparable and to reduce variability in banks' internal models, in June 2017 the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) to assess the reliability and comparability between b anks' models. The TRIM aims to create a level playing field by harmonising the regulatory guidance around internal models with the ultimate goal of restoring trust in European banks' use of internal models .\n\nIn July 2019, the ECB published the final chapters of the guide to internal models, covering credit risk, market risk and counterparty credit risk. These risk-type-specific chapters are intended to ensure a common and consistent approach to the most relevant aspects of the regulations on internal models for banks directly supervised by the ECB. Additionally, they provide transparency on how the ECB understands the regulations on the use of internal models to calculate own funds requirements for the three risk types. Impact on ING is through more stringent regulation on the end-to-end process and governance around internal models as well as an increase of risk weighted assets (RWA).\n\nIn 2020, the last TRIM ECB inspection ended. Per rating system the ECB has sent and will send final TRIM decision letters, which will include obligations that ING shall remediate. Also certain limitations such as restrictions on PD and/or LGD, effectively resulting in higher capital requirements, have or might be put in place until these obligations are fully addressed and closed.",

        "page_content": "Corporate governance\n\n- > Solvency risk\n\n## Solvency risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nSolvency risk is the risk of lacking sufficient capital to fulfil the business objectives, regulatory requirements or market expectations. A bank that is completely insolvent is unable to pay its debts and will be forced into bankruptcy.\n\nThe level and quality of capital is crucial for the resilience of individual banks. Banks are expected to assess the risks they face, and in a forward-looking manner ensure that all material risks are identified, managed and covered sufficiently by loss absorbing capital to ensure continuity in case of materialisation of unexpected risks in times of stress. Given the interdependencies to other financial and non-financial risks this balancing act of capital adequacy needs to be done within a sound and integrated management approach coherently linking all moving parts of the bank in line with the longterm business strategy.\n\n## Solvency risk management\n\n## ICAAP Framework\n\nING's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes (ICAAP) aims to ensure that capital levels are adequate to cover all material risks at all levels and to ensure compliance with regulations. ING follows an integrated approach to assess the adequacy of its capital position in relation to its business activities, underlying business strategy, market positioning risk profile and operating environment. This implies taking into account the interests of its various stakeholders such as regulators, shareholders, investors, rating agencies, clients and customers.\n\nThe continued strength of ING's capital position, the adequacy of the financial position and the risk management effectiveness are essential for achieving the Think Forward strategy. ING's ICAAP ultimately supports this strategy and contributes thereby to the continuity of ING Group, ING Bank and all its business units.\n\nManaging ING's capital requirements and allocation entails f inding a balance between the forces governing supply and demand. The uncertainties surrounding these factors are a reflection of changing market circumstances and continuous unpredictability in regulatory and macroeconomic\n\nforces. The process of balancing these strategic goals is captured in the ICAAP framework and enabled by the building blocks and elements facilitating the ICAAP. The following building blocks have been defined in the ICAAP Framework, which are applied for both the 'normative' and 'economic' perspective as defined in the ECB Guide to ICAAP that was published in November 2018:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and assessment\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Capital planning\n- \u00b7 Capital management\n- \u00b7 Stress testing\n- \u00b7 Continuity\n\n## Solvency risk related to Covid-19\n\nThe outbreak of the Covid-19 stress tests resulted in several additional analyses to assess the potential impact of the virus on the actual and future solvency position. For instance, in 2020 ING performed a sequence of Covid-19 stress tests to assess potential scenarios of how the virus would develop and how it may impact society and economies. These Covid-19 stress tests were used to prepare potential mitigating actions, but also served as starting point for the review of ING's risk appetite and of the financial and capital planning. In light of this, ING also updated the management actions in the Contingency Capital & Funding Plan and the Recovery Plan and assessed potential additional mitigating actions to counter this very specific crisis.\n\n## Risk identification and assessment\n\nING's capital management and solvency risk management starts with the risk identification & risk assessment process. Its main purpose is to detect potential new risks and to identify changes in the potential impact of known risks. On an annual basis, ING performs a thorough review of its solvency risks or risks to capital. Within this assessment, bottom-up assessments are combined with top-down assessments, including a questionnaire and interviews with senior management. The results of the risk assessment are discussed in ALCO Bank which comprises almost the full Management Board Banking. Once approved, the conclusions of the risk assessment feed into the annual review of the Risk Appetite Framework, the Stress Testing Framework and the Economic Capital Framework. In addition to this annual process, ING also re-assesses its risks as part of its Capital Adequacy Statement, a quarterly process to assess ING's capital adequacy.",

        "page_content": "Corporate governance\n\n- > Solvency risk\n\n## Solvency risk appetite\n\nAs explained in the Risk Appetite Framework section in the previous chapter, ING has established overarching solvency risk boundaries. Boundaries are risk appetite statements that are essential for risk management activity, making it of paramount importance to keep these boundaries within the defined level. The SB is responsible for approving and monitoring the boundaries. These boundaries are complemented by a sequence of risk-type-specific instruments. These underlying risk appetite statements are cascaded down into the organisation to the lowest level deemed necessary and dedicated risk thresholds are set that are used for day-today monitoring and management of ING's risks. ING has solvency risk appetite statements in place for the following metrics: CET1 ratio, Total capital ratio, leverage ratio, TLAC RWA/leverage ratio and economic capital utilisation.\n\n## Capital planning\n\nThe c apital and funding plan is an integral part of the dynamic plan, ING's financial and business planning process. Its objective is to inform and advise the management on the capital development and need of ING Group and ING Bank, under base case and adverse scenarios. It describes how ING shall finance the expected capital constraints taking into consideration growth projections, capital and risk evolution, macro and market conditions, both under the normative and economic perspective. The capital & funding plan is updated at least twice a year, and discussed and approved by ALCO Bank. Within these updates, ING takes into account recent market and risk developments and ensures that the capital planning adheres to the solvency risk appetite set by the SB.\n\n## Capital management\n\nAmong the solvency management tools the formulation of the CET1 ambition forms a key element. The target ratio which is based on the management buffer concept enables ING's senior management to steer, benchmark and assess the bank's current and future capital levels much more efficiently while the ambition level clearly supports trust building among ING's key stakeholders (e.g. regulators, investors, customers and clients).\n\nThe capital management buffer aims to protect the interests of key stakeholders (e.g. shareholders, investors) and plays an important role in the overall capital adequacy governance.\n\nThe rationale behind the concept of the management buffer is that it provides an additional cushion on top of the (local) regulatory minimum requirements (e.g. SREP requirements) to withstand a certain level of stress and to facilitate awareness and preparedness to take management actions. ING reviews its capital management buffer on a regular basis to determine its effectiveness and robustness, and updates it as appropriate.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nSolvency stress testing allows a bank to examine the effect of exceptional but plausible future events on the solvency position and provides insight into which entities or portfolios are vulnerable to which type of risks or in which type of scenarios. Solvency stress testing is an important tool in identifying, assessing, measuring and controlling risks to capital, providing a complementary and forward-looking perspective to other solvency risk management tools.\n\nING distinguishes the following three types of stress test analyses:\n\n- \u00b7 Sensitivity analysis: Within these analyses, ING assess the impact of a pre-defined shock in one or more risk drivers. The key purpose of sensitivity analyses is to monitor the impact of this predefined (or standardised) shock over time to get an understanding of how the risk profile of the bank has developed.\n- \u00b7 Scenario analysis: Scenario analyses are used to assess an integral impact of historical, statistical and/or hypothetical circumstances on the financial position of ING. These stress tests often build on a qualitative scenario narrative and reflect risk topics that are deemed relevant for ING given, for example, its business model. Scenarios can be derived from historical realisations, but also reflect e.g. potential macroeconomic, geopolitical or climate risk related events. These scenarios can be used for one-off analyses, but can also be translated into a set of regular or standardised stress tests that are assessed on a quarterly basis.\n- \u00b7 Reverse stress testing: The purpose of reverse stress testing is to identify scenarios that could lead to a pre-defined outcome. This could for example be a pre-defined solvency level. The added value of reverse stress testing is to explore risk drivers and stress scenarios outside the existing range.\n\nThe outcomes of solvency stress test analyses are taken into account in capital planning, but also for setting risk appetite statements and the capital management buffer.",

These events may be ING -specific, or arise from external factors. The Contingency Capital and Funding Plan (CCFP) sets out the organisation and actions in case of contingency events. The CCFP has a suite of monitoring metrics that are aligned with the risk appetite statements that are in place for managing ING's capital, liquidity and funding position. The Recovery Plan is designed by ING to detect and act upon possible major and unforeseen deterioration of its solvency position in a timely fashion. This plan has integrated several risk appetite statements to allow timely identification of possible stress on the company. Incorporating risk appetite statements into both plans ens ures a seamless continuum between the ING's business -as-usual management and its contingency or recovery management.\n\n## Assessing capital adequacy: Capital Adequacy Statement (CAS)\n\nThe Capital Adequacy Statement (CAS) is ING Group's quarterly assessment of i ts capital adequacy and takes into account different elements with respect to its capital position. The degree to which ING's capital position is considered to be adequate depends on a variety of internal and external drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 Current supervisory requirements and (expected) requirements going forward;\n- \u00b7 Current internal requirements and (expected) requirements going forward;\n- \u00b7 Coherence of the available capital with the (realisation of) strategic plans; and\n- \u00b7 The ability to meet internal and external requirements in the case of stressed events or should a risk materialise.\n\nThe CAS assesses the adequacy of ING's capital position in relation to above -mentioned drivers and states the extent to which the capital position consequently is considered as adequate. On a quarterly basis the CAS document is prepared. Additionally each year, the management body signs and provides a comprehensive assessment of ING's capital adequacy, supported by the ICAAP outcomes, in the form of a Capital Adequacy Statement.",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\n- > Credit risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss from the default and/or credit rating deterioration of clients. Credit risks arise in ING's lending, financial markets and investment activities. The credit risk section provides information on how ING measures, monitors and manages credit risk and gives an insight into the portfolio from a credit risk perspective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nING's credit risk strategy is to maintain an internationally diversified loan and bond portfolio, while avoiding large risk concentrations. The emphasis is on managing business developments within the business lines by means of a top-down risk appetite framework, which sets concentration limits for countries, individual clients, sectors, products, secondary risk (collateral/guarantees) and investment activities. The aim is to support relationship-banking activities, while maintaining internal risk/reward guidelines and controls.\n\nING has organised support functions at two levels: Tier 1, operational unit level, and Tier 2, head office level. Credit risk is a Tier 1 level risk function within ING and is part of the second line of defence. It is managed by regional and/or business unit CROs. The CRO Wholesale Banking (WB), CRO Challengers & Growth Markets (C&G), CRO Netherlands and CRO Belux focus on specific risks in the geographical and/or business areas of their responsibilities. The Financial Risk department is a Tier 2 level risk function, which is responsible for the consolidated risk appetite setting, risk frameworks, model development and policies.\n\nThe credit risk function encompasses the following activities:\n\n- \u25aa Measuring, monitoring and managing credit risks in the bank's portfolio, including the measures taken since the start of the Covid-19 crisis;\n- \u25aa Challenging and approving new and modified transactions and borrower reviews;\n- \u25aa Managing the levels of provisioning and risk costs, and advising on impairments; and\n- \u25aa Providing consistent credit risk policies, systems and tools to manage the credit lifecycle of all activities.\n\n## Credit risk categories  (*)\n\nCredit risk uses the following risk categories to differentiate between the different types of credit risk:\n\n- \u25aa Lending risk: is the risk that the client (counterparty, corporate or individual) does not pay the principal, interest or fees on a loan when they are due, or on demand for letters of credit (LCs) and guarantees provided by ING.\n- \u25aa Investment risk : is the credit default and risk rating migration risk that is associated with ING's investments in bonds, commercial paper, equities, securitisations, and other similar publicly traded securities. This can be viewed as the potential loss that ING may incur as a result of holding a position in underlying securities whose issuer's credit quality deteriorates or defaults. All investments in the banking book are classified in the investment risk category. The primary purpose of ING's investments in the banking b ooks is for liquidity management.\n- \u25aa Money market (MM) risk : arises when ING places short-term deposits with a counterparty in order to manage excess liquidity. In the event of a counterparty default, ING may lose the deposit placed.\n- \u25aa Pre-settlement (PS) risk : arises when a client defaults on a transaction before settlement and ING must replace the contract by a trade with another counterparty at the then prevailing (possibly unfavourable) market price. This credit risk category is associated with derivatives transactions (exchange-traded derivatives, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing transactions).\n- \u25aa Settlement risk : is the risk that arises when there is an exchange of value (funds or instruments) for the same value date or different value dates and receipt is not verified or expected until after ING has given irrevocable instructions to pay or has paid or delivered its side of the trade. The risk is that ING delivers but does not receive delivery from its counterparty. ING manages settlement risk in the same way as other credit risks by setting a risk limit per client. Due to the short-term nature (typically one day), ING does not hold provisions for settlement risk. Although a relatively low risk, ING increasingly uses DVP (delivery versus payment) and safe settlement payment techniques to reduce settlement risk.\n\nFor the reconciliation between credit risk outstandings categories and financial assets, refer to the table below:",

It is derived from the concepts of boundaries and instruments as described in the ING Risk Appetite Framework.\n\nCredit risk appetite is the maximum level of credit risk ING is willing to accept for growth and value creation. The credit risk appetite is linked to the overall bank-wide risk appetite framework. The credit risk appetite is expressed in quantitative and qualitative measures. Having a credit risk appetite achieves:\n\n- \u25aa Clarity about the credit risks that ING is prepared to assume, target setting and prudent risk management;\n- \u25aa Consistent communication to different stakeholders;\n- \u25aa Guidelines on how to align reporting and monitoring tools with the organisational structure and strategy; and\n- \u25aa Alignment of business strategies and key performance indicators of business units with ING's credit risk appetite through dynamic planning.\n\nCredit risk appetite is set at different levels within ING and specifies the scope and focus of the credit risk of ING, and the composition of the credit portfolio, including its concentration and diversification objectives in relation to business lines, sectors and products.\n\nThe credit risk appetite and concentration risk framework is composed of:\n\n- \u25aa Country risk concentration : Country risk is the risk that arises due to events in a specific country (or group of countries). In order to manage the maximum country event loss ING is willing to accept, boundaries are approved by the SB. The estimated level is correlated to the risk rating assigned to a given country.  Actual country limits are set by means of country instruments, which are reviewed monthly and updated when needed. For countries with elevated levels of geopolitical or severe economic cycle risk, monitoring is performed on a more frequent basis with strict pipeline and exposure management.\n\n- \u25aa Single name and industry sector concentration : ING has established a credit concentration risk framework in order to identify, measure and monitor single name concentration and industry sector concentration (systemic risk). The same concept of boundaries and instruments is applicable.\n- \u25aa Product and secondary risk concentration : ING has established a concentration framework to identify, measure and monitor product concentration and secondary risk.\n- \u25aa Scenarios and stress tests : Stress testing evaluates ING's financial stability under severe, but plausible stress scenarios, and supports decision-making that assures ING remains a financially going concern even after a severe event occurs. In addition to the bank-wide stress testing framework described above, ING performs regularly sensitivity analyses to assess portfolio risks and concentrations. These sensitivity analyses are consistent with the stress scenario established in the Group-wide credit risk appetite framework. In light of Covid-19 ING incorporated pandemic specific scenarios for the stress tests to gain insight into the potential effects of Covid-19 on the credit risk in the portfolios.\n- \u25aa Product approvals : The product approval and review process (PARP) assesses and manages risks associated with the introduction of new or modified products. It ensures that sound due diligence is performed by relevant stakeholders and the relevant risks (credit, operational, compliance, etc.) are addressed appropriately.\n- \u25aa Sector strategy and risk appetite papers : These are detailed analyses of defined products and/or industries. They identify the major risk drivers and mitigants, the internal business mandate, and propose the risk (including business) parameters -and potentially the maximum product and/or portfolio limit - to undertake that business. A sector strategy and risk appetite paper is always prepared by the front office responsible for the internal business mandate and requires an approval from the designated approval authority. Sector strategy and risk appetite papers may carry various names and/or may have geographical and/or business limitations (e.g. local vs global).",

For each type of client there is a dedicated process with credit risk managers specialised along the business lines of ING, including the use of automated decision-making in certain cases. The credit approval process is supported by a risk rating system and exposure monitoring system. Risk ratings are used to indicate a client's creditworthiness which translates into a probability of default. This is used as input to determine the maximum risk appetite that ING has for a given type of client (reference benchmark). The determination of the delegated authority (the amount that can be approved at various levels of the organisation) is a function of the risk rating of the client and ING's credit risk exposure on the client . Where necessary, underwriting standards were reviewed and refined to limit the credit risk to portfolios particularly sensitive to Covid-19.\n\n## Credit risk models (*)\n\nWithin ING, internal Basel compliant models are used to determine probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD) for regulatory and economic capital purposes. These models also form the basis of ING's IFRS 9 loan loss provis ioning (see 'IFRS 9 models' below). Bank-wide, ING has implemented around 100 credit risk models, for regulatory capital, economic capital and loan loss provisioning purposes.\n\nThere are two main types of PD, EAD and LGD models used throughout the Bank:\n\n- \u25aa Statistical models are created where a large set of default or detailed loss data is available. They are characterised by a sufficient number of data points that facilitate meaningful statistical estimation of the model parameters. The model parameters are estimated with statistical techniques based on the data set available;\n- \u25aa Hybrid models contain characteristics of statistical models combined with knowledge and experience of experts from risk management and front-office staff, literature from rating agencies, supervisors an d academics. These models are especially appropriate for 'low default portfolios', where limited historical defaults exist.\n\n## Credit risk rating process  (*)\n\nIn principle, all risk ratings are based on a Risk Rating (PD) Model that complies with the minimum requirements detailed in CRR/CRDIV, ECB Supervisory Rules and EBA guidelines. This concerns all borrower types and segments.\n\nING's PD rating models are based on a 1 -22 scale (1=highest rating; 22=lowest rating) referred to as the 'Master scale', which r oughly corresponds to the rating grades that are assigned by external rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. For example, an ING rating of 1 corresponds to an S&P/Fitch rating of AAA and a Moody's rating of Aaa; an ING rating of 2 c orresponds to an S&P/Fitch rating of AA+ and a Moody's rating of Aa1, and so on.\n\nThe 22 grades are composed of the following categories:\n\n- \u25aa Investment grade (risk rating 1-10);\n- \u25aa Non-investment grade (risk rating 11-17);\n- \u25aa Sub-standard (risk rating 18-19); and\n- \u25aa Non-performing (risk rating 20-22).\n\nThe three first categories (1-19) are risk ratings for performing loans. The ratings are calculated in IT systems with internally developed models based on data that is either manually or automatically fed. Under certain conditions, the outcome of a manually fed model can be challenged through a rating appeal process. Risk ratings for non-performing loans (NPL) (20-22) are set by the global or regional credit restructuring department. For securitisation portfolios, the external ratings of the tranche in which ING has invested are leading.\n\nRisk ratings assigned to clients are reviewed at least annually, with the performance of the underlying models monitored regularly. Some of these models are global in nature, such as models for large corporates, commercial banks, insurance companies, central governments, local governments, funds, fund managers, project finance and leveraged companies. Other models are more regional- or country-specific: there are PD models for small medium enterprise (SME) companies in Central Europe, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, as well as residential mortgage and consumer loan models in the various retail markets.",

Rating models for large corporates, institutions and banks include both statistical characteristics and manual input, with the ratings being manually updated on at least an annual basis. During 2020, portfolios and clients most at risk of being affected by the pandemic were subject to more frequent (e.g. quarterly) reviews to closely monitor the development of credit risk.\n\n## Credit risk systems\n\n## Credit risk tools and data standards\n\nThe acceptance, maintenance, measurement, management and reporting of credit risks at all levels of ING is executed through single, common credit risk data standards using shared credit risk tools that support standardised and transparent credit risk practices. ING has chosen to develop credit risk tools centrally with the philosophy of using a single source of data in an integrated way. This includes applying a combination of the ING policy, the regulatory environment in which we operate and the daily processes that are active throughout the Group. Disciplined application in these three areas is essential for achieving high data quality standards.\n\nIn 2020, ING established a Credit Risk Control Unit (CRCU), which is part of the Financial Risk department, with the main objective to contribute to compliant and continuously improving rating systems.\n\n## Credit risk portfolio (*)\n\nING's credit exposure is mainly related to lending to individuals and businesses followed by investments in bonds and securitised assets, and money market. Loans to individuals are mainly mortgage loans secured by residential property. Loans (including guarantees issued) to businesses are often collateralised, but may be unsecured based on the internal analysis of the borrower's creditworthiness. Bonds in the investment portfolio are generally unsecured, but predominantly consist of bonds issued by central governments and EU and/or OECD based financial institutions. Secured bonds, such as mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities are secured by the underlying diversified pool of assets (commercial or residential mortgages, car loans and/or other assets) held by the securities issuer. For money market, exposure is mainly deposits to central banks. The last major credit risk source involves pre-settlement (PS) exposures which arise from trading activities, including derivatives, repurchase transactions and securities lending/borrowing transactions. This is also commonly referred to as counterparty credit risk.\n\nThe prior period outstandings by economic sector (industry) have been updated reflecting improved classification of clients. This is applicable to all following tables in the sections credit risk portfolio, credit risk mitigation and credit quality that includes outstandings by economic sectors with prior period comparatives.",

amount of credit risk in the respective column using ING's internal credit risk measurement methodologies. Economic sectors (industry) below 2% are not shown separately but grouped in Other.\n- 3   Geographic areas are based on country of residence, except for private individuals for which the geographic areas are based on the primary country of risk.\n- 4   The prior period outstandings by economic sector (industry) have been updated reflecting improved classification of clients.\n\n## Overall portfolio (*)\n\nDuring 2020, ING's portfolio size increased by \u20ac 33.5 billion (+3.93% ) to \u20ac 887.5 billion outstandings. The net volume growth was concentrated in the Money Market and Lending risk categories and was mainly due to growth in exposures to Central Banks relating to participation in TLTRO III. Excluding Central Banks, the portfolio size decreased by \u20ac14.0 billion, driven by a reduction in Lending exposures and FX impact mainly due to the weakening of the US dollar against euro.\n\nForeign exchange rate changes had a negative impact on portfolio growth and reduced total outstanding by \u20ac13.9 billion. This was driven by the depreciation of the US dollar ( -8.45%), Polish new zloty (-6.64%), New Turkish lira (-26.65%) and the British pound (-5.36%) against the euro.\n\n## Rating distribution (*)\n\nIn 2020, governments and banks introduced numerous measures to financially support individuals and businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic. These support measures in many case prevent or delay financial difficulties of customers. As a result, Covid-19 did not materially affect the overall rating distribution in the portfolio per 31 December 2020. Refer to 'Covid -19 sensitive sectors' for the impact on the portfolios most sensitive to Covid-19.",

The share of investment grade rating classes increased from 68.7% to 72.8%, while the share of non-investment grade decreased, from 29.3% to 25.0%. Substandard grade outstanding remained stable at 0.7% of total portfolio, whereas the nonperforming loans (NPL) grade increased share from 1.3% to 1.5%.\n\nWith respect to the rating distribution within the business lines, in Wholesale Banking AAA and AA rated assets increased driven by Central Banks exposures, mainly due to the transfer of the reserve deposit with the Dutch central bank (DNB) from Corporate Line Bank to Wholesale Banking. Further decrease in BBB rating class for Wholesale Banking was see n with Commercial Banks' exposures, while for BB rating the outstanding decreased primarily in natural resources and transportation and logistics industries.\n\nThe rating distribution for Retail Benelux improved mostly because of Dutch residential mortgages, shifting from rating class BB to ratings A and BBB, driven by continuing increase of the NVM house price index and improving LTVs, despite Covid-19. Additionally, a trend of early repayments was visible in the Dutch mortgage portfolio, further reducing the share of BB rating class. Residential mortgages in Belgium also improved in rating distribution, reducing concentration in BB and B ratings, while increasing in AA, A and BBB. On the other hand, the retail mid-corporates portfolio showed a worsening of rating distribution both in Belgium and the Netherlands, shifting volumes from BBB to B rating.\n\nIn Retail Challengers & Growth Markets, the increase in AAA-rating was explained by increased reserve deposits the central banks of Germany and Australia. Similarly, rating class A increased due to exposures to Banco de Espana. Further, the increase in AA is partially explained by Australian residential mortgages . In Germany residential mortgage loans grew steadily, mainly in rating classes A and BBB, with Poland and Spain also contributing to the growth of A-rated residential mortgages.\n\nCorporate line decreased concentration in AAA rating class due to the transfer of the reserve deposit with the Dutch central bank (DNB) to Wholesale Banking.\n\n## Industry (*)\n\nThe industry composition within Retail is concentrated in private individuals with 67% for Retail Benelux and 73% for Retail Challengers & Growth. Dutch residential mortgages continued to decrease driven by run-off at Westland Utrecht bank and higher regular repayments, partly mitigated by stable new production at Domestic Bank NL throughout 2020. In Belgium, residential mortgages slightly decreased in total volume, while an increase was seen with lease products in Belgium mid-corporate portfolio.\n\nIn C&G, apart from mortgage volumes growth, an increased outstanding was seen in Lower Public Administration (seen in Germany, France and Australia) and in Real Estate (Australia).\n\nWithin Wholesale Banking, the sector development in Central Banks is consistent with the development in the investment grade category above. Exposures towards Central Governments increased due to higher bond investments with Italy, Poland and France, while Commercial Banks decreased exposure, driven by lower volumes of trade-related transactions, seen in Australia.\n\nThe most noticeable reduction in Wholesale Banking was seen in Natural Resources, where exposures decreased significantly, most visible in Singapore, Luxembourg, US, UK and UAE. Outstanding to Transportation & Logistics also decreased, seen in the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Belgium, partly mitigated by an increase in Germany. Apart from the above ING Wholesale increased its exposure to Lower Public Administration (Germany and France), while overall exposure decreased in Food, Beverages & Personal Care (Belgium and Argentina).\n\n## Covid-19 sensitive sectors (*)\n\nAviation (Transportation & Logistics): exposure amounted to \u20ac4.6 billion outstanding (0.52 % of total portfolio). In terms of rating, the distribution of outstanding worsened compared to 2019, with main concentration shifting from BBB to BB and B rating classes. Substandard grade outstanding increased to 1.2% from 0% of Aviation portfolio, whereas the non-performing grade increased to 4.5% from 0%.",

The share of the Netherlands in the overall portfolio remained stable at 25%.\n\nThe most noticeable trend in the Netherlands was the increase in exposure with the central bank. Apart from that, lower volumes of residential mortgage loans were visible, as well as lower bond exposures towards the Dutch Central Government. For Belgium the increase in exposures towards the central bank was partially offset by reduced outstanding to Lower Public Administration and slight decrease in residential mortgage volumes.",

For both countries substandard grade remained relatively stable (little below 1%). For the Netherlands, the NPL grade decreased to 1.2% from 1.4%, while for Belgium it increased to 3.1% from 2.5%.\n\nIn Germany, Spain and Poland, residential mortgages increased due to strong market position and stable business volume growth. Germany, Spain and Australia also showed increased exposures to central banks.\n\nRating distribution in Germany improved: the share of investment grade increased (central banks), while non-investment grade slightly decreased. Substandard grade (0.4%) also reduced share, while NPL grade slightly increased (0.7%). Poland and Spain also showed rating distributions improvement, as in both investment grade share increased (central banks and mortgages). Substandard grade remained stable at 0.6% for Poland and 0.3% for Spain, as for NPL grade, it was stable at 2.2% for Poland and 0.9% for Spain.\n\nIn Luxemburg despite the reduced overall exposure to central banks and Natural Resources, the rating distribution remained stable: investment grade at 77.1%, non-investment grade slightly decreased to 21.8%. Substandard grade increased to 0.8% from 0.3%, while NPL grade remained at 0.3%.\n\nFor Rest of Europe, the exposure decreased due to lower exposure with the central bank of the Czech Republic, lower outstanding in Turkey, mainly due to FX impact and a reduction of exposure in Switzerland, visible in Natural Resources.\n\nThe lower exposure in the Americas was mainly driven by FX impact and decreased volumes of term loans to US Corporates, mainly in Natural Resources, partly offset by higher outstanding to US NonBank FIs. A similar reduction in outstanding for Natural Resources was visible in Asia (mainly in Singapore and UAE), which was partially offset by increased exposure to Technology industry.\n\nIn Australia, outstanding increased, driven by Central Bank exposures and exposures in Real Estate, partly compensated by lower volumes of trade related transactions with Commercial Banks.\n\nIn terms of rating distribution for America region the share of investment grade increased to 66.3% from 61.1%, while non-investment grade decreased to 31.1% from 36.7%. Substandard grade remained at 0.7%, while NPL slightly increased to 1.8% from 1.6%. For Asia, investment grade moved slightly up to 75.4%, non-investment and substandard decreased to 22.5% and 0.2% respectively, while the NPL increased its share to 1.9% from 0.3% of outstanding in Asia. Australia's rating distribution remained stable with slight shift of outstanding from non-investment to investment grade.\n\nThe top five countries within Rest of Europe based on outstanding were: Italy (\u20ac17,544 million), Switzerland (\u20ac10,494 million), Turkey (\u20ac9,579 million), Romania (\u20ac8,484 million) and Russian Federation (\u20ac4,964 million).\n\n## Credit risk mitigation (*)\n\nING uses various credit risk mitigation techniques and instruments to mitigate the credit risk associated with an exposure and to reduce the losses incurred subsequent to a default by a customer. The most common termi nology used in ING for credit risk protection is 'cover'. While a cover may be an important mitigant of credit risk and an alternative source of repayment, generally it is ING's practice to lend on the basis of the customer's creditworthiness rather than e xclusively relying on the value of the cover.\n\n## Cover forms (*)\n\nWithin ING, there are two distinct forms of covers. First, where the asset has been pledged to ING as collateral or security, ING has the right to liquidate it should the customer be unable to fulfil its financial obligation. As such, the proceeds can be applied towards full or partial compensation of the customer's outstanding exposure. This may be tangible (such as cash, securities, receivables, inventory, plant and machinery, and mortgages on real estate properties) or intangible (such as patents, trademarks, contract rights and licences). Second, where there is a third-party obligation, indemnification or undertaking (either by contract and/or by law), ING has the right to claim from that third party an amount if the customer fails on its obligations. The most common examples are guarantees (such as parent guarantees and export credit insurances) or third-party pledged mortgages.",

        "page_content": "- > Credit risk\n\n## Cover valuation methodology (*)\n\nGeneral guidelines for cover valuation are established to ensure consistent application within ING. These also require that the value of the cover is monitored on a regular basis. Covers are revalued periodically and whenever there is reason to believe that the market is subject to significant changes in conditions. The frequency of monitoring and revaluation depends on the type of cover.\n\nThe valuation method also depends on the type of covers. For asset collateral, the valuation sources can be the customer's bala nce sheet (e.g. inventory, machinery and equipment), nominal value (e.g. cash and receivables), market value (e.g. securities and commodities), independent valuations (commercial real estate) and market indices (residential real estate). For third-party obligations, the valuation is based on the value that is attributed to the contract between ING and that third party.\n\n## Cover values (*)\n\nThis section provides insight into the types of cover and the extent to which exposures benefit from collateral or guarantees. The disclosure differentiates between risk categories (lending, investment, money market and pre-settlement). The most relevant types of cover include mortgages, financial collateral (cash and securities) and guarantees. ING obtains cover that is eligible for credit risk mitigation under CRR/CRDIV, as well as cover that is not eligible. Collateral covering financial market transactions is valued on a daily basis, and as such not included in the following tables. To mitigate the credit risk arising from Financial Markets transactions, the bank enters into legal agreements governing the exchange of financial collateral (high-quality government bonds and cash).\n\nThe cover values are presented for the total portfolio of ING, both the performing and non-performing portfolio. Our definition of non-performing is explained in detail in 'Credit restructuring' (below). For additional insight, a breakdown of ING's portfolio by industry and geography is provided .\n\nExposures are categorised into different value-to-loan (VTL) buckets that give insight in the level of collateralisation of ING's portfolio. VTL is calculated as the cover value divided by the outstandings at the balance sheet date. The cover values are indexed where appropriate and exclude any cost of liquidation. Covers can either be valid for all or some of a borrower's exposures or particular outstandings, the latter being the most common. For the purpose of aggregation, over-collateralisation is ignored in the total overview and VTL coverage of more than 100% is reported as fully covered. For VTL coverage in the tables for Dutch mortgages, consumer lending and business lending, each cover is subsequently assigned to one of the six defined VTL buckets: no cover, >0% to 25%, >25% to 50%, >50% to 75%, >75% to <100%, and \u2265 100% .\n\nThe next table gives an overview of the collateralisation of the ING's total portfolio .",

Excluding the pre-settlement portfolio, 50.4% of ING's outstandings were fully collateralised in 2020 (2019: 53.5%). Since investments traditionally do not require covers, the percentage for 'no covers' in this portfolio is above 90%. However, 99% of the investment outstanding is investment grade. Improved economic conditions in ING's main markets contributed to improved collateral valuations, observed in consumer lending .",

As a result, most of the collateral consists of mortgages. The mortgage values are collected in an internal central database and in most cases external data is used to index the market value (e.g. mortgage values for the Netherlands are updated on a quarterly basis using the NVM/CBS house price index).\n\nA significant part of ING's residential mortgage portfolio is in the Netherlands (3 6.6%), followed by Germany (25.9%), Belgium and Luxembourg (13.4%) and Australia (10.7%). Given the size of the Dutch mortgage portfolio, the valuation methodology to determine the cover values for Dutch residential mortgages is provided below.\n\n## Dutch mortgages valuation (*)\n\nWhen a mortgage loan is granted in the Netherlands, the policy dictates maximum loan to market value (LTMV) for an existing property and for construction property financing of 100 percent.\n\nIn case of newly built houses usually the building /purchase agreement is sufficient as valuation. In the case of existing houses three types of valuations are allowed. If the LTMV is below 90 percent, either WOZ (fiscal market value, determined by government authorities) or an automated model valuation (the Calcasa ING Valuation) are permitted.\n\nIn most cases, a valuation is performed by certified valuers that are registered at one of the organisations accepted by ING. In addition, the valuer must be a member of the NVM (Nederlandse Vereniging van Makelaars -Dutch Association of Real Estate Agents), VBO (Vereniging Bemiddeling Onroerend Goed -Association of Real Estate Brokers), VastgoedPRO (Association of Real Estate Professionals) or NVR (Nederlandse Vereniging van Rentmeesters).",

The rise in collateralisation levels was due to rising housing prices observed in different mortgage markets, specifically noticeable in the Netherlands.\n\nING' s residential mortgage outstanding increased mainly in Germany (4.9%), Spain (7.4%) and Poland (10.3%). In 2019 the increases where respectively 3.1%, 14.8% and 23.2%. Mortgage outstanding in the Netherlands decreased slightly (2.3%). For the residential mortgages portfolio, the cover type guarantees relate to mortgages covered by governmental insurers under the Dutch national mortgage guarantee (NHG) scheme in the Netherlands. The NHG guarantees the repayment of a loan in case of a forced property sale.",

Breakdowns are provided by industry as well as by geographical region or market, based on the residence of the borrowers.\n\nBroken down by industry, the largest increase in outstanding is attributable to Central Banks (\u20ac37.4 billion, 88.8%) followed by Utilities (\u20ac1 .0 billion, 6.2%). The largest decrease in outstanding was observed in Natural Resources (\u20ac10.6 billion), where the total cover percentage increased .\n\nThe proportion of the business lending portfolio in Australia and Switzerland with no cover decreased substantially year-on-year, respectively from 37.3% to 26.4% and from 35.7% to 27.2% in 2019. Most industry types experienced an increase in total covers. The largest increases in outstanding in absolute figures were seen in the Netherlands (23.9%) and Germany (90.9%). The increase in Germany (\u20ac16.7 billion) was primarily due to increases in regulatory reserve deposits and nostro accounts. As these\n\ndeposits and nostro accounts are not collateralised, this increase had only a small impact on total cover amounts.",

Business lending past due but performing remained stable at \u20ac7.8 billion, whereas c onsumer lending past due but performing decreased by 22% (\u20ac -0.7 billion). The \u20ac2.0 billion non-performing outstanding increase was distributed as follows; Retail Benelux ( \u20ac +1.1 billion) and Retail Challengers & Growth Markets ( \u20ac +0.9 billion). Within Retail Banking Benelux the private\n\nindividuals outstanding increase accounted for \u20ac +0.7 billion, mainly driven by the introduction of the new definition of default for mortgages. while for retail business this was \u20ac +0.4 billion in Builders & Contractors and the Services sectors. Within Retail Challengers & Growth Markets the increase was seen for private individuals. This was mainly driven by mortgages forbearance measures granted to clients in the form of payment holidays not in scope of the European Banking Association (EBA) moratoria guidelines and classified as in default, as well as the implementation of new definition of default for secured consumer lending.\n\n## Past due obligations (*)\n\nRetail Banking continuously measures its portfolio in terms of payment arrears and on a monthly basis determines if there are any significant changes in the level of arrears. This methodology is principally extended to loans to private individuals, such as residential mortgage loans, car loans and other consumer loans, as well as business lending . An obligation is considered 'past due' if a payment of interest or principal is more than one day late. ING aims to help its customers as soon as they are past due by communicating to remind them of their payment obligations. In its contact with the customers, ING aims to solve the (potential) financial difficulties by offering a range of measures (e.g. payment arrangements, restructuring). If the issues cannot be cured, for example because the customer is unable or unwilling to pay, the contract is sent to the recovery unit. The facility is downgraded to risk rating 20 (non-performing) when the facility or obligor -depending on the level at which the nonperforming status is applied - is more than 90 days past due and to risk rating 21 or 22 when the contract is terminated.\n\nING has aligned the regulatory concept of non-performing with that of the definition of default. Hence, in Wholesale Banking, obligors are classified as non-performing when a default trigger occurs:\n\n- \u25aa ING believes the borrower is unlikely to pay; the borrower has evidenced significant financial difficulty, to the extent that it will have a negative impact on the future cash flows of the financial asset. The following events could be seen as indicators of financial difficulty:\n- \u25aa The borrower (or third party) has started insolvency proceedings;\n- \u25aa A group company/co-borrower has NPL status;\n- \u25aa Indication of fraud (affecting the company's ability to service its debt) ;\n- \u25aa There is doubt as to the borrower's ability to generate stable and sufficient cash flows to service its debt;\n- \u25aa Restructuring of debt.",

Within Retail Benelux the decrease was noticeable in the 130 days bucket for Belgium (\u20ac -0.2 billion) mainly driven by the implementation of the new definition of default via the introduction of the unlikely to pay assessment by which short arrears result in defaults, as well as the Covid-19 related payment holidays granted after which days past due counting stops, and the Netherlands (\u20ac -0.1 billion), due to the good payment behaviour of our clients which is facilitated by strict underwriting rules, low interest rates, low unemployment and low bankruptcy, as well as the financial aid measures granted by the Dutch government to employees and employers because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Although, there was a similar sized but opposite difference visible in the 130 days bucket (\u20ac +0.4 billion) and the 61-90 days bucket (\u20ac -0.3 billion). The largest contributors in the 130 days bucket were seen in America (\u20ac +1.3 billion), Bermuda (\u20ac +0.2 billion) on some larger client names. This was partially offset by the decreases witnessed in France (\u20ac -0.5 billion), Spain (\u20ac -0.3 billion) and Belgium (\u20ac -0.3 billion). The largest contributors to the decrease in the 6190 days bucket were Sweden (\u20ac -0.1 billion) and America (\u20ac -0.1 billion).",

GCR handles accounts or portfolios requiring an active approach, which may include renegotiation of terms and conditions and business or financial restructuring. The loans are managed by GCR or by units in the various regions and business units.\n\nING uses three distinct statuses to categorise the management of clients with (perceived) deteriorating credit risk profiles, i.e. there is increasing doubt as to the performance and the collectability of the client's contractual obligations:\n\n- \u25aa Watch List : Usually, a client is first classified as Watch List when there are concerns of any potential or material deterioration in credit risk profile that may affect the ability of the client to adhere to its debt service obligations or to refinance its existing loans. Watch List status requires more than usual attention, increased monitoring and quarterly reviews. Some clients with a Watch List status may develop into a Restructuring status or even a Recovery status.\n- \u25aa Restructuring : A client is classified in Restructuring when there are co ncerns about the client's financial stability, credit worthiness, and/or ability to repay, but where the situation does not require the recall or acceleration of facilities or the liquidation of collateral. ING's actions aim to maintain the going concern status of the client by:\n- \u25aa Restoring the client's financial stability;\n- \u25aa Supporting the client's turnaround;\n- \u25aa Restoring the balance between debt and equity; and\n- \u25aa Restructuring the debt to a sustainable situation.\n- \u25aa Recovery : A client is classified as in Recovery when ING and/or the client concludes that the client's financial situation cannot be restored and a decision is made to end the (credit) relationship or even to enter into bankruptcy. ING will prefer an amicable exit, but will enforce and liquidate the collateral or claim under the guarantees if deemed necessary.\n\nWatch List, Restructuring and Recovery accounts are reviewed at least quarterly by the front office, GCR and the relevant credit risk management executives.\n\n## Forbearance  (*)\n\nForbearance occurs when a client is unable to meet their financial commitments due to financial difficulties it faces or is about to face and ING grants concessions towards this client. Forborne assets are assets in respect of which forbearance measures have been granted.\n\nForbearance may enable clients experiencing financial difficulties to continue repaying their debt.\n\nFor business customers, ING mainly applies forbearance measures to support clients with fundamentally sound business models that are experiencing temporary difficulties with the aim of maximising the client's repayment ability and therewith avoiding a default situation or helping the client to return to a performing situation.\n\nFor ING retail units, clear criteria have been established to determine whether a client is eligible for the forbearance process. Specific approval mandates are in place to approve the measures, as well as procedures to manage, monitor and report the forbearance activities.\n\nING reviews the performance of forborne exposures at least quarterly, either on a case-by-case (business) or on a portfolio (retail) basis.\n\nAll exposures are eligible for forbearance measures, i.e. both performing (Risk Ratings 1-19) and nonperforming (Risk Ratings 20-22) exposures. ING uses specific criteria to move forborne exposures from non-performing to performing or to remove the forbearance statuses that are consistent with the corresponding EBA standards. An exposure is reported as forborne for a minimum of two years. An additional one-year probation period is observed for forborne exposures that move from nonperforming back to performing.\n\nDuring 2020, ING supported clients affected by the Covid-19 pandemic among others by providing payment holidays. In line with European Banking Authority (EBA) Guidelines, exposures subject to these payment holidays are not classified as forborne. Refer to 'Payment holidays' below for more information on payment holidays.",

Belgium followed with 28% (2019: 24%) of the total Retail Banking forborne assets.\n\n## Payment holidays\n\nGlobally, 2020 has been dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the distressing human and economic cost thereof. The shutdown of various businesses immediately affected banking customers and as such various measures have been and continue to be implemented in order to minimise shortand long-term economic and customer impacts. In many countries, governments have adopted economic support programs (such as tax advantages, unemployment regulations or guarantees) that we believe will assist ING clients in potential financial difficulty to manage through these extraordinary times. In addition, various initiatives have been taken by ING to grant payment holidays, (guaranteed) new money facilities etc.\n\nGovernments in almost all Retail Banking countries have adopted measures providing for payment holidays. As of end-December, in line with the European Banking Association (EBA) moratoria guidelines, approximately 196,000 customers had been granted payment holidays under schemes that were eligible under the EBA moratoria guidelines. The total exposure of loans for which a payment holiday was granted amounts to \u20ac19.4 billion, of which over 55% were for customers located in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the end of 2020, 93% of granted payment holidays had expired.\n\nThe payment holiday schemes offered in the various countries differ in terms of scope, benefit duration and key conditions. Generally, underlying conditions differ per country in terms of tenor, deferment of principal and interest payments. The payment holidays are applied to business lending, mortgages and consumer loans.\n\nThe modification of contractual terms of loans subject to payment holiday arrangements does not automatically result in derecognition of the financial assets. Where applicable, the carrying amount of the financial asset has been recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate and a gain or loss was recognised.\n\nThe various measures by governments and ING to alleviate the impact of Covid-19 also impact the loan classification in terms of forbearance and consequently IFRS 9 staging. In light of this, the EBA has provided guidelines that expired on 30 September 2020, which defined eligibility criteria for a payment holiday arrangement offered to a large group of customers to be classified as a 'general payment mor atorium'. Based on the guidelines, the granting of these payment holidays did not lead to forbearance classifications. Therefore, it did not automatically trigger recognition of lifetime Expected Credit Loss (ECL) either. A small number of payment holidays were granted outside this scheme and were flagged as forborne. ING followed the EBA guidelines and when a payment holiday was provided to a customer as part of a 'general payment moratorium', ING did not consider this measure to classifiable as forbearance. EBA further extended these guidelines in the first week of December 2020, valid until 31 March 2021, with certain extra conditions. ING decided not to make use of the extension of these guidelines and has taken a prudent decision to treat all payment holiday requests under new or extended schemes (after September 2020) as stage 2 or stage 3 exposures.\n\n## Non-performing loans (*)\n\nING's loan portfolio is under constant review. Loans to obligors that are considered more than 90 days past due on material exposure are reclassified as non-performing. For commercial lending portfolios, there generally are reasons for declaring a loan non-performing prior to the obligor being 90 days past due. These reasons include, but are not limited to, ING's assessment of the customer's perceived inability to meet its financial obligations, or the customer filing for bankruptcy or bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe table below represents the breakdown by industry of credit risk outstandings for lending and investment positions that have been classified as non-performing.",

The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to on-balance sheet financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), such as loans, debt securities and lease receivables, as well as offbalance sheet items such as undrawn loan commitments, certain financial guarantees, and undrawn committed revolving credit facilities.\n\n## IFRS 9 models (*)\n\nThe IFRS 9 models leverage the advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) models (PD, LGD, EAD), which include certain required conservatism. In order to include IFRS 9 requirements, such regulatory conservatism is removed from the ECL parameters (PD, LGD and EAD). The IFRS 9 models apply two types of adjustments to the ECL parameters: (1) to economic outlook and (2) for stage 2 and stage 3 assets only, to the lifetime horizon. The IFRS 9 model parameters are estimated based on statistical techniques and supported by expert judgement.\n\nING has aligned the definition of d efault for regulatory purposes with the definition of 'credit -impaired' financial assets under IFRS 9 (Stage 3). To comply with the new regulatory technical standards (RTS) and EBA guidelines, ING updated its definition of default in the first quarter of 2020. Consequently, ING updated this definition also for IFRS 9 purposes. More information can be found in section 1.6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Portfolio quality (*)\n\nThe table below describes the portfolio composition over the different IFRS 9 stages and rating classes. The Stage 1 portfolio represents 91.8% (2019: 94.0%) of the total gross carrying amounts, mainly composed of investment grade, while Stage 2 makes up 6.8% (2019: 4.7%) and Stage 3 makes up 1.5% (2019: 1.3%) total gross carrying amounts, respectively.",

The transfers of financial instruments represent the impact of stage transfers upon the gross carrying/nominal amount and associated allowance for ECL. This includes the netremeasurement of ECL arising from stage transfers, for example, moving from a 12-month (stage 1) to a lifetime (stage 2) ECL measurement basis.\n\nThe net remeasurement line represents the changes in provisions for facilities that remain in the same stage.\n\nPlease note the following comments with respect to the movements observed in the table below:\n\n- \u25aa Stag e 3 gross carrying amount increased by \u20ac2.4 billion from \u20ac11.0 billion as per 31 December 2019 mainly as a result of ING's introduction of a new definition of default (\u20ac1.0 billion) and due to developments with respect to certain large individual files in the first half of 2020. For further background on implementation of the new definition of default, please refer to section 1.6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- \u25aa Stage 2 gross carrying amount increased by \u20ac20.9 billion from \u20ac41.1 billion as per 31 December 2019. This is mainly caused by the Watch List trigger (\u20ac10.2 billion) and the forbearance trigger (\u20ac9.5 billion) and to a lesser extent to other triggers such as 30 Days Past Due and the significant lifetime PD trigger, primarily in Wholesale Banking and Retail Market Leaders;",

For details refer to the section 'payment holidays'.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity analysis of key sources of estimation uncertainty (*)\n\n## Methodology (*)\n\nOur methodology in relation to the adoption and generation of macroeconomic scenarios is described in this section. We continue to follow this methodology in generating our probability-weighted ECL, with consideration of alternative scenarios and management adjustments supplementing this ECL where, in management's opinion, the consensus forecast does not fully capture the extent of recent credit or economic events. The macroeconomic scenarios are applicable to the whole ING portfolio in the scope of IFRS 9 ECLs.\n\nThe introduction of IFRS 9, with its inherent complexities and potential impact on the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities, represents a key source of estimation uncertainty. In particular, ING's reportable ECL numbers are most sensitive to the forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts used as model inputs, the probability-weights applied to each of the three scenarios, and the criteria for\n\nidentifying a significant increase in credit risk. As such, these crucial components require consultation and management judgement, and are subject to extensive governance.\n\n## Baseline scenario (*)\n\nAs a baseline for IFRS 9, ING has adopted a market-neutral view combining consensus forecasts for economic variables (GDP, unemployment) with market forwards (for interest rates, exchange rates and oil prices). The Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model (OEGEM) is used to complement the consensus with consistent projections for variables for which there are no consensus estimates available (most notably house prices and -for some countries - unemployment), to generate alternative scenarios, to convert annual consensus information to a quarterly frequency and to ensure general consistency of the scenarios. As the baseline scenario is consistent with the consensus view it can be considered as free from any bias.\n\nThe relevance and selection of macroeconomic variables is defined by the ECL models under credit risk model governance. The scenarios are reviewed and challenged by two panels. The first panel consists of economic experts from Global Markets Research and risk and modelling specialists, while the second panel consists of relevant senior managers.\n\n## Alternative scenarios and probability weights (*)\n\nTwo alternative scenarios are taken into account; an upside and a downside scenario. The alternative scenarios have, to a large extent, a technical character as these are based on the forecast errors of the OEGEM.\n\nTo understand the baseline level of uncertainty around any forecast, Oxford Economics keeps track of all its forecast errors of the past 20 years. The distribution of forecast errors for GDP, unemployment, house prices and share prices is applied to the baseline forecast creating a broad range of alternative outcomes. In addition, to understand the balance of risks facing the economy in an unbiased way, Oxford Economics runs a survey with respondents from around the world and across a broad range of industries. In this survey the respondents put forward their views of key risks. Following the survey results, the distribution of forecast errors (that is being used for determining the scenarios) may be skewed.",

The upside scenario is represented by the 10th percentile of the distribution. The applicable percentiles of the distribution imply a 20% probability for each alternative scenario. Consequently, the baseline scenario has a 60% probability weighting. Please note that, given their technical nature, the downside and upside scenarios are not based on an explicit specific narrative.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios applied (*)\n\nThe provisions are based on the December consensus forecasts.\n\n## Baseline assumptions (*)\n\nThe December 2020 consensus anticipates global output (ING definition), after declining sharply in 2020 by 3.6%, to bounce back to 5.0% growth in 2021 and 3.8% in 2022. The consensus reflects that near-term economic weakness - resulting from a re-imposition of restrictions on mobility and firms, in order to prevent a further spread of the coronavirus -will be followed by an economic recovery underpinned by the start of a vaccination program in many parts of the world enabling a lifting of lockdowns. This could bring world real GDP back to pre-crisis levels by mid-2021. China is in the lead with the economy touching pre-crisis levels again already in the second half of 2020. But the US economy may not reach that level before the third quarter of 2021 and the eurozone not before the second quarter of 2022. Lagging the economic recovery, unemployment in a number of countries may continue to increase up to the third quarter of 2021 as government policy measures to preserve jobs may end. Most countries are expected to end the forecast period with higher unemployment rates than observed before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Further out in the forecast horizon, the unemployment rate is generally expected to fall back as the economic recovery continues (3.8% growth of world output in 2022).\n\nWhen compared to the June 2020 consensus forecast, used for the second quarter interim reporting, the December forecast assumes a smaller shrink in 2020 global GDP (-3.6% compared to -4.8%) following a generally stronger than expected economic rebound. The fourth quarter re-imposition of lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus results, compared to June, in a less strong global recovery in 2021 (5.0% versus 5.1%) but the likely roll-out of an effective vaccine brightens the outlook further out (global growth in 2022 3.8% versus 3.2% in June).\n\nWhen compared to the consensus forecast used for the final 2019 reporting, the current outlook is substantially different as at that time no assumptions with respect to the possible consequences of the spread of the coronavirus have been incorporated. The baseline scenario at the time assumed continued world economic growth close to 2.5% per year in 2020-2022.\n\n## Alternative scenarios and risks (*)\n\nUncertainty around the base case is high as new cases of Covid-19 remain high in many countries and restrictions to mobility have been tightened again, increasing the risk that the economic recovery falls back. There is also uncertainty around the degree to which government support schemes will continue to limit the increase in unemployment. And while there is positive news about the efficacy of a vaccine, many logistical and production challenges lie ahead.\n\nTo reflect the heightened uncertainty, the dispersion of the forward-looking distributions -from which the alternative scenarios are being derived -has been increased while maintaining a downward skew following on from the outcomes of Oxford Economics' Glob al Risk Survey. Specifically, the forecast bandwidths projected for the end of the forecast horizon have now been applied to the near term as well.\n\nThe upside scenario -though technical in nature - implies a quick return of output to its precoronavirus baseline forecast and more positive medium-term prospects than envisaged in the baseline scenario. In this scenario, unemployment rates quickly fall back from their peaks in 2020. In spirit it is a scenario where medical advances allow for a more rapid easing of lockdowns. A faster restoration of confidence among business and households would result in private spending and business activity accelerating more markedly in 2021 and beyond.\n\nThe downside scenario, while being equally technical in nature, represents an even more pronounced near-term global downturn than expected in the baseline scenario. The downside scenario reflects the risk of the coronavirus pandemic not only posing significant risks to the near-term outlook but also having longer-lasting negative effects on economic growth (e.g. because of faster de-leveraging and weaker productivity growth).",

In these cases management adjustments can be applied to appropriately reflect ECL. Management adjustments can also be applied where the impact of the updated macroeconomic scenarios is over- or underestimated by the IFRS 9 models.\n\nAn overlay of \u20ac394 million was taken in December 2020 because of time lags in defaults occurring in this crisis, as a result of support programmes, while GDP growth forecasts were improving as 2020 is now over  and more favourable 2021 GDP growth forecasts (and subsequent years) are now being taken into account in the models. As it is expected that additional defaults as a result of the crisis will still come in, the overlay was taken which was calculated using a scenario with a time lag between GDP growth forecasts deteriorating and defaults occurring.\n\nAs mentioned above, per the guidance from EBA, Covid-19 related payment holidays granted until September 2020 have not automatically been classified as forbearance, and hence, have not automatically triggered recognition of lifetime ECL in stage 2. Looking forward, it is expected that the phasing out of the support measures in the course of 2021 could lead to more business insolvencies and unemployment. This could lead to more clients that have currently taken payment holidays getting into financial difficulties and to higher levels of defaults. To the extent ING believes that this elevated risk is not yet covered in the IFRS 9 models, a management adjustment has been recognised.\n\nThis management adjustment has been recognised for SME and mid-corporate portfolios as these portfolios are considered to be most at risk and have the highest percentage of customers requesting payment holidays compared to other portfolios. ING has recognised a management adjustment of \u20ac85 million in the Netherlands and \u20ac131 million in Belgium as they are the largest SME portfolios and not significantly impacted by macroeconomic forecasts updates. Furthermore, a management adjustment of \u20ac28 million has been recognised in Australia for the mortgage portfolio which is also a portfolio where relative many payment holidays are granted and which is considered at risk.\n\nIn addition, as the oil price remains volatile, as well as exposed to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and subject to political decisions, ING recognised a management adjustment for the upstream oil book of \u20ac 25 million.\n\n## Analysis on sensitivity (*)\n\nThe table below presents the analysis on the sensitivity of key forward-looking macroeconomic inputs used in the ECL collective-assessment modelling process and the probability-weights applied to each of the three scenarios. The countries included in the analysis are the most significant geographic regions, in terms of both gross contribution to reportable ECL, and sensitivity of ECL to forward-looking macroeconomics. Accordingly, ING considers these portfolios to present the most significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of financial assets within the next financial year. ING also observes that, in general, the Wholesale Banking business is more sensitive to the impact of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThe purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to enable the reader to understand the extent of the impact on model based reportable ECL from the upside and downside scenario. The table does not include any management adjustments, except for the overlay for time lag in defaults of \u20ac394 million as at 31 December 2020.\n\nIn the table below the Real GDP is presented in percentage year-on-year change, the unemployment in percentage of total labour force and the house price index (HPI) in percentage year-on year change.\n\nWhile the table does give a high-level indication of the sensitivity of the outputs to the different scenarios, it does not provide insight into the interdependencies and correlations between different macroeconomic variable inputs. On total ING level, the unweighted ECL for all collective provisioned clients in the u pside scenario was \u20ac2,770 million, in the b aseline scenario \u20ac3,082 million and in the downside scenario \u20ac4,362 million compared to \u20ac3,276 reportable collective provisions currently accounted for (including time lag overlay, excluding other management adjustments).\n\nWhen compared to the sensitivity analysis of 2019 the macroeconomic inputs are substantially different, as at that time no assumptions with respect to the possible consequences of the spread of the coronavirus had been incorporated. The macroeconomic inputs used in the 2020 sensitivity analysis reflect that, after declining sharply in 2020, a bounce back in Real GDP is expected in 2021 and 2022. Furthermore the downside scenario has an increased downward skew, reflecting the continuing uncertainty related to the impact of Covid-19.",

An asset belongs in stage 2 if it is considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial origination or purchase. The stage allocation process involves an asset's derived scenario weighted average PD being assessed against a set of PD threshold bandings, which determines the appropriate staging and ECL. Stage 2 is triggered when either a threshold for absolute change in lifetime PD or relative change in lifetime PD is hit. The thresholds for the absolute change in lifetime PD vary between 75bps for Retail portfolios, 100bps for Wholesale and 250bps for SMEs, based on the characteristics of the specific portfolio. We are however in a transition phase to determine this on a portfolio level, which has been implemented for a few Turkish and Polish models which already have deviating lifetime PD thresholds. The threshold for the relative change in lifetime PD is inversely correlated with the PD at origination; the higher the PD at origination, the lower the threshold. Despite this, the relative threshold is punitive for investment grade assets while the absolute threshold primarily affects speculative grade assets. On ING Group level, the total ECL collectiveassessment for performing assets is \u20ac1,678 million (2019: \u20ac1,291 million) (without taking management adjustments into account).\n\nThe setting of PD threshold bandings requires management judgement, and is a key source of estimation uncertainty. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to these PD thresholds bandings, analysis was run on all collectively-assessed assets, which assumed all assets (stage 1 and 2) were below the threshold, and apportioned a 12-month ECL. On the same asset base, analysis was run which assumed all performing assets were above the threshold, and apportioned a lifetime ECL. This gave rise to hypothetical collectiveassessment ECLs of \u20ac1,242 million (2019: \u20ac866 million) and \u20ac3,552 million (2019: \u20ac2,665 million) respectively. Please note that in this analysis all other ECL risk parameters (except for the stage) were kept equal.\n\nIt should be noted that the lifetime PD thresholds are not the only drivers of stage allocation. An asset can change stages as a result of being in arrears, being on a Watch List or being forborne, among other triggers. Refer to section 1.7.8 of Note 1 ' Basis of preparation and accounting policies ' for an exhaustive list. Furthermore, this analysis is rudimentary in that other parameters would change when an asset changes stages.",

Market risk either arises through positions in banking books or trading books. The banking book positions are intended to be held for the long term (or until maturity) or for the purpose of hedging other banking book positions. The trading book positions are typically held with the intention of short-term trading or in order to hedge other positions in the trading book. This means that financial instruments in the trading books should be free of trade restrictions. Policies and processes are in place to monitor the inclusion of positions in either the trading or banking book as well as to monitor the transfer of risk between the trading and banking books.\n\nING recognises the importance of sound market risk management and bases its market risk management framework on the need to identify, assess, control and manage market risks. The approach consists of a cycle of five recurring activities: risk identification, risk assessment, risk control, risk monitoring and risk reporting.\n\n(*)\n\n- \u25aa Risk identification is a joint effort of the first and second lines of defence. The goal of risk identification is to detect potential new risks and any changes in known risks. See 'Risk Governance' for more on our 'three lines of defence' governance model;\n- \u25aa Identified risks are assessed and measured by means of various risk metrics to determine the importance of the risk to ING and subsequently to identify the control measures needed;\n- \u25aa Risk control measures used by ING include policies, procedures, minimum standards, limit frameworks, buffers and stress tests;\n- \u25aa Risk monitoring occurs to check if the implemented risk controls are executed, complied with across the organisation, and are effective; and\n- \u25aa Market risk management results and findings are reported to the necessary governing departments and approval bodies.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nA governance framework has been established defining specific roles and responsibilities of business management units, market risk management units, and internal approval bodies per activity.\n\nSupervision of market risk falls under the responsibility of the MBB and is delegated to the ALCO function, where ALCO Bank is the highest approval authority and sets the market risk appetite. ALCO Bank monitors ING's adherence to the risk appetite for market risk and sets additional limits where appropriate. These limits are cascaded through the organisation through lower level ALCOs. This ALCO structure facilitates top-down risk management, limit setting, and the monitoring and control of market risk.\n\nThe monitoring and control of market risk is the responsibility of the Financial Risk (FR) department and Financial Institutions -Financial Markets (FI-FM) Risk. FR and FI-FM Risk are the designated departments of the second line of defence that report to the CRO function and are responsible for the design and execution of the bank's market risk and counterparty credit risk management functions in support of the ALCO function. FR focuses on the market risks in the banking books, whereas FI-FM Risk is responsible for counterparty credit risk and market risks resulting from the Financial Markets trading books. FR and FI-FM Risk are responsible for determining adequate policies and procedures for actively managing market risk in the banking and trading books and for monito ring ING's compliance with these guidelines.\n\nFR and FIFM Risk also maintain a limit framework in line with ING's Risk Appetite Framework. The businesses are responsible for adhering to limits that are ultimately approved by the ALCO Bank. Limit excesses are reported to senior management on a timely basis and the business is required to take appropriate actions based on management decisions. To adhere to the established limit framework, ING implements hedging and risk mitigation strategies that range from the use of traditional market instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to more sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of risk factors arising at the portfolio level.\n\nThe organisational structure facilitates top-down risk management by recognising that risk taking and risk management to a large extent occur at the regional/local level. Bottom-up reporting from regional/local units to head office units allows each management level to fully assess the market risks relevant at the respective levels.",

These committees have a functional reporting line to ALCO Bank. The Market Risk Model Committee (MRMC) is the dedicated authority within ING for the approval of all trading and banking risk models, methodologies and parameters related to market risk. The Trading Pricing Model Committee (TPMC) approves pricing models for trading and banking books. Financial Risk and FI-FM Risk departments provide systematic risk reporting to the EB and MBB, the ALCO Bank and the senior executive management of related business functions.\n\nThe FI-FM risk management framework governs the boundary between trading books and banking books. It defines the activities ING considers to be trading according to a regulatory definition and for own funds requirement purposes. Trading activity is systematically reviewed and positions are assessed against the mandates jointly by the first and second lines of defence. As specified in the framework, the transfer of risk or the transfer of positions between banking and trading books is in principle not allowed. In exceptional cases when a re-designation is deemed necessary, the redesignation should be approved by senior management.\n\nThe following sections elaborate on the various elements of the risk management framework for:\n\n- \u25aa Market risk economic capital (trading and banking books);\n- \u25aa Market risks in banking books; and\n- \u25aa Market risks in trading books.\n\n## Market risk economic capital (trading and banking books)\n\nEconomic capital for market risk is the economic capital necessary to withstand unexpected value movements due to changes in market variables and model risk.\n\nEconomic capital for market risk is calculated for exposures both in trading portfolios and banking portfolios and includes interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, customer behaviour risk, real estate risk, model risks and pension risk. Economic capital for market risk is calculated using internally developed methodologies with a 99.9% confidence level and a horizon of one year.\n\nFor the trading books and the linear interest rate risk and equity investments in the banking books, the Value at Risk (VaR) is taken as a starting point for the economic capital calculations for market risk. The VaR is measured at a 99% confidence level with a one-day holding period.\n\nTo arrive at the economic capital for market risk, a simulation-based model is used which includes scaling to the required confidence level and holding period. In determining this scaling factor, other factors are also taken into account like the occurrence of large market movements (events).\n\nEmbedded options, e.g. the prepayment option and offered rate option in mortgages in the banking books, result in non-linear interest rate risk in the banking books. Embedded options are economically hedged using a delta-hedging methodology, leaving the mortgage portfolio exposed to convexity risk, volatility risk and model risk. For the calculation of economic capital for this non-linear interest rate risk, ING performs a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nReal estate price risk includes the market risks in both the real estate investment and the development portfolio of the ING Wholesale Banking business line. The economic capital for real estate price risk is calculated by stressing the underlying market variables.\n\nWhile aggregating the different economic capital market risk figures for the different portfolios, diversification benefits (based on stressed correlations) are taken into account as it is not expected that all extreme market movements will appear at the same moment.",

Positions in banking books originate from the market risks inherent in commercial products that are sold to clients, Group Treasury exposures, and from the investment of our own funds (core capital). Both the commercial products and the products used to hedge market risk exposures in these products are intended to be held until maturity, or at least for the long term.\n\n## Risk transfer (*)\n\nAn important element of the management of market risks in the banking book is the risk transfer process. In this process the interest rate, FX, funding and liquidity risks are transferred from the commercial books through matched funding to Group Treasury, where it is centrally managed.

        "page_content": "- > Market risk\n\n## Risk measurement (*)\n\nThe main concepts and metrics used for measuring market risk in the banking book are described below per risk type.\n\n## Interest rate risk in banking book (*)\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is defined as the exposure of a bank's earnings, capital, and market value to adverse movements in interest rates originated from positions in the banking book.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nThe management of interest rate risk follows the Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) framework as approved by ALCO Bank. This framework describes roles, responsibilities, risk metrics, and the policies and procedures related to interest rate risk management. Furthermore ALCO Bank sets the risk appetite for interest rate risk, which is then translated into limits for the interest rate risk metrics.\n\nAs a result of this framework, ING centralises interest rate risk management from commercial books (that capture the products sold to clients) to globally managed interest rate risk books. This enables a clear demarcation between commercial business results and results based on unhedged interest rate positions.\n\nING distinguishes between three types of activities that generate interest rate risk in the banking book:\n\n- \u25aa Investment of own funds;\n- \u25aa Commercial business; and\n- \u25aa Group Treasury exposures including strategic interest rate positions.\n\nBelow the three activities are described in more detail:\n\nGroup Treasury is responsible for managing the investment of own funds (core capital). Capital is invested for longer periods to keep earnings stable. The main objective is to maximise the economic value of the book and to generate adequate and stable annual earnings within the risk appetite boundaries set by ALCO Bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate governance\n\nCommercial activities can result in linear interest rate risk, for example, when re-pricing causes the tenors of assets to differ from those of liabilities. Also, interest rate risk can arise from customer behaviour and/or convexity risk, depending on the nature of the underlying product characteristics. customer behaviour risk is defined as the potential future value loss due to deviations in the actual behaviour of clients versus the modelled behaviour towards the embedded options in commercial products. General sources of customer behaviour risk, amongst others, include the state of the economy, competition, changes in regulation, legislation and tax regime, and developments in the housing market. Since these risk factors cannot be (fully) mitigated, ING holds capital to be able to absorb possible losses as a result of unforeseen customer behaviour.\n\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, commercial activities can typically be divided into three main product types: savings and demand deposits, mortgages, and loans.\n\n- \u25aa Savings and demand deposits are generally invested so as to hedge their value and minimise the sensitivity of the margin to market interest rates. Interest rate risk can arise when there is a lag between savings rate adjustments and the adjustments experienced through market rates or when market rate changes cannot be passed on to clients. Interest rate risk is modelled based on the stability of the deposit and the pass-through rate. This takes into account different elements, such as pricing strategies, volume developments and the level and shape of the yield curve. Savings volumes are typically assumed to be relatively stable and not sensitive to rate changes;\n- \u25aa Interest rate risk for mortgages arises through prepayment behaviour. In modelling this risk, both interest rate dependent pre-payments and constant prepayments are considered. Next to the dependence on interest rates, modelled prepayments may include other effects such as loan-to-value, seasonality and the reset date of the loan. In addition, the interest sensitivity of embedded offered rate options is considered; and\n- \u25aa Wholesale Banking loans typically do not experience interest rate dependent prepayment behaviour; these portfolios are matched-funded taking the constant prepayment model into account. They typically do not contain significant convexity risk. Wholesale banking loans can have an all-in rate floor or a floor on a reference rate.\n\nCustomer behaviour in relation to mortgages, loans, savings and demand deposits is modelled, based on extensive research. Per business unit and product type, exposures are typically segmented into different portfolios based on expected client behaviour. For each of the segments, model parameters",

Models are backtested and updated when deemed necessary in an annual procedure. Model parameters and the resulting risk measures are approved by (local) ALCO.\n\nLinear risk transfers take place from commercial business books to the treasury book (Group Treasury), if necessary, by using estimations of customer behaviour. The originating commercial business is ultimately responsible for estimating customer behaviour, leaving convexity risk and (unexpected) customer behaviour risk with the commercial business. Risk measurement and the risk transfer process take place on a monthly basis. However, if deemed necessary additional risk transfers can take place, for instance due to volatile markets.\n\nThe commercial business manages the convexity risk that is the result of products that contain embedded options, like mortgages. Here the convexity risk is defined as the optionality effects in the value due to interest rate changes, excluding the first-order effects. In some cases, convexity risk is transferred from the commercial books to treasury books using cap/floor contracts.\n\nIn the following sections, the interest rate risk exposures in the banking books are presented. ING uses risk measures based on both an earnings and a value perspective. Net interest income (NII)-at-risk is used to provide the earnings perspective and the net present value (NPV)-at-risk and basis point value (BPV) figures provide the value perspective. Please note that corrective management actions are not taken into account in these figures although price adjustments are included in the earnings risk measure.\n\nDuring 2020, the following refinements to the risk measurement for IRRBB were made:\n\n- \u25aa Review of the risk appetite for IRRBB;\n- \u25aa Further insights in sub-risk types such as vega optionality risk, tenor basis risk and a client behaviour risk earnings and value metrics\n- \u25aa Annual review of the interest rates scenarios used for calculating NII-at-Risk and NPV-at-Risk;\n- \u25aa Savings/ current account model updates and prepayment model updates for market developments; and\n- \u25aa Specific Covid-19 related stress test.\n\n## Net interest income (NII) at Risk  (*)\n\nNII-at-Risk measures the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income (before tax) of the banking book with a time horizon of one year (expanding to a horizon of three years). This excludes credit spread sensitivity and fees. The NII-at-Risk figures in the tables below reflect a parallel interest rate shock under the assumption of the balance sheet development in line with the dynamic plan with a time horizon of one year. As well as parallel scenarios, IRRBB monitoring and management includes the impact of non-parallel scenarios and the impact over a longer horizon. NII-at-Risk asymmetry between the downward and upward ramped scenarios is primarily caused by the asymmetry between pricing behaviour of mortgages and savings products due to embedded options and pricing constraints.\n\n| in EUR million                      | 2020                                          | 2020                                          | 2019                                | 2019                                |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                     | Ramped, unfloored   parallel  \u25bc   parallel  \u25b2 | Ramped, unfloored   parallel  \u25bc   parallel  \u25b2 | Ramped, unfloored   \u25bc   parallel  \u25b2 | Ramped, unfloored   \u25bc   parallel  \u25b2 |\n|                                     |                                               |                                               | parallel                            |                                     |\n| By business                         |                                               |                                               |                                     |                                     |\n| Wholesale Banking                   | 135                                           | -83                                           | -12                                 | 12                                  |\n| Retail Banking Benelux              | -114                                          | 105                                           | -91                                 | 40                                  |\n| Retail Challengers & Growth Markets | -52                                           | -14                                           | -3                                  | -3                                  |\n| Corporate Line Banking              | -52                                           | 52                                            | -30                                 | 30                                  |\n| Total                               | -83                                           | 60                                            | -136                                | 79                                  |\n\nEUR ramped is at +/- 100bps in 1 year\n\nUSD ramped is at +/- 120bps in 1 year",

This is driven by balance sheet developments, the low interest rate environment and savings model updates for market developments mainly in ING Germany, ING Spain and ING Poland. The annual update of the interest rate scenarios also led to a limited increase in the NII-at-Risk for year one.\n\n## Net Present Value (NPV) at Risk (*)\n\nNPV-at-Risk measures the impact of changing interest rates on value. The NPV-at-Risk is defined as the outcome of an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates from applying currency-specific scenarios. The NPV-at-Risk asymmetry between the downward and upward shock is mainly caused by convexity risk in the mortgage and savings portfolio. The NPV-at-Risk figures are also calculated using the updated interest rate scenarios.\n\nThe full value impact cannot be directly linked to the financial position or profit or loss account, as fair value movements in banking books are not necessarily reported through the profit or loss account or through other comprehensive income (OCI).

In line with recommendations from the Financial Stability Board, a fundamental review and reform of the major interest rates benchmarks has been undertaken. For the eurozone, this led to a reform of the EURIBOR benchmark rate and development of \u20acSTR as the recommended new nearly risk -free-rate (RFR) to replace EONIA. For LIBOR benchmarks, the reform will include replacing current LIBOR rates with alternative, nearly risk-free rates. For example RFR Working Groups in the US and UK have recommended to replace USD LIBOR and GBP LIBOR with SOFR and SONIA respectively when these LIBOR rates cease to exist. This process is at different stages, and is progressing at different speeds, across several major currencies.\n\nThe reform of EURIBOR was completed in 2019 and consisted of a change to the underlying calculation methodology. The Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to EURIBOR under the EU Benchmarks Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use EURIBOR after 1 January 2020 for both existing and new contracts. ING expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Working Group on Euro Risk-Free Rates is continuing its work on developing recommended fallback rates based on the \u20acSTR for EURIBOR contracts.\n\nEONIA will cease to be published by 3 January 2022 and the European Money Markets Institute (EONIA's administrator) has indicated that EONIA cannot be used in any contracts that may b e outstanding as of 1 January 2022. The transition of existing contracts and products that still rely on EONIA is ongoing. As both EONIA and \u20acSTR are overnight rates and the spread between them was established in 2019 this transition is considered less complex than that for LIBOR.\n\nThe ICE Benchmark Administration, as the administrator of LIBOR, issued a consultation with respect to its plans for the cessation for most LIBOR rates at the end of 2021, with an 18 month extended period of publication for USD LIBOR to support legacy products. ING is in the process of amending or preparing to amend contractual terms in response to this, and there is still some uncertainty over the timing and the methods of transition. ING is proactively reaching out to industry participants, counterparties and clients to create awareness and offer support on the ongoing transition.\n\nDuring 2020 the financial sector issued a number of interim targets, guidance papers and other initiatives to help phase in key components of this transition. For example significant progress was made to address deficiencies in existing derivative fallback clauses. ISDA issued an IBOR fallbacks supplement that sets out how the transition to alternative benchmark rates (e.g. SOFR, SONIA) will be accomplished. The effect of the supplement is to create clear fallback rates that will apply on the permanent discontinuation of certain key IBORs. From the effective date of 25 January 2021, all new derivatives that reference these ISDA definitions include these robust fallbacks. The Group and many other parties have also adhered to a protocol to implement these fallbacks into derivative contracts that were entered into before the effective date. If both counterparties adhere to the protocol, these new fallbacks will be automatically implemented into existing derivative contracts. For loans, various recommendations have been made to help drive consistent use of robust fallbacks for new contracts. These industry recommendations are incorporated into our contract templates used for new lending.\n\nPublic authorities have also recognised that certain LIBOR contracts do not contain any alternatives, contain inappropriate alternatives, or cannot be renegotiated or amended prior to the expected cessation of LIBOR. In response, the European Commission announced that it intends to implement legislation that gives market participants the confidence to transition these 'tough legacy' contracts to the recommended benchmark replacement without the fear of legal repercussions. In addition, the UK government announced that it would grant powers to the FCA to enable continued publication of a ''synthetic'' LIBOR using a different methodology and inputs, and therefore could reduce disruption to any holders of these tough legacy contracts. However, there is no certainty as to whether the FCA will exercise these powers or what form the revised methodology would take, and the FCA has consequently encouraged users of LIBOR to renegotiate or amend as many contracts as possible before the relevant LIBOR. There is no guarantee that regulators will implement measures to address such legacy contracts, or that such measures will be effective in avoiding business disruption or contractual disputes.",

The potential discontinuation of interest rate benchmarks, or changes in the methodology or manner of administration of any benchmark, could result in a number of risks for ING Group, its customers, and the financial services industry more widely. These risks include legal risks in relation to changes required to documentation for new and existing transactions that may be required. Financial risks (predominantly limited to interest rate risk) may also arise from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark rates, and changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some instruments. Changes in valuation, methodology or documentation may also result into complaints or litigation. The Group  may also be exposed to operational risks or incur additional costs due to the potential requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes, or in relation to communications with clients or other parties and engagement during the transition period. Particularly, one of the main risks to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform is operational. For example, the renegotiation of loan contracts through bilateral negotiation with customers, updating of contractual terms, updating of systems that use IBOR and revision of operational controls related to the reform.\n\nThe ING IBOR programme has a robust governance in place, with progress being tracked by business line steering committees reporting into a central IBOR steering committee. The programme assesses and coordinates the actions necessary to manage the required changes to internal processes and systems, including pricing, risk management, legal documentation, hedge arrangements, as well as the impact on our customers. ING continues to monitoring market developments, and the outcome of several remaining uncertainties such as the availability of term rates, to anticipate the impact on the program, our customers and any related risks.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 the following financial instruments have yet to transition to alternative benchmark rates, summarised by significant benchmark rate. The table below excludes exposures that will expire before transition is required. For all rates this has been taken as 31 December 2021, despite some recent developments that indicate that USD LIBOR will be available until mid-2023.

Phase 1 addresses those issues that affect financial reporting before the replacement of an existing benchmark. Phase 1 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2019. Phase 2 focuses on issues that may affect financial reporting when the existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced. Phase 2 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2020. In 2019, ING early adopted the Phase 1 amendments to IFRS which allowed ING to apply a set of temporary exceptions to continue hedge accounting even when there is uncertainty about contractual cash flows arising from the reform. Under these temporary exceptions, interbank offered rates are assumed to continue unaltered for the purposes of hedge accounting until such time as the uncertainty is resolved. Refer to Note 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for the disclosures relating to the application of the amendments as part of Phase 1.\n\nThe Phase 2 amendments to IFRS relating mainly to accounting for changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets and liabilities due to the IBOR reform and impact on hedge accounting when an existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced with an alternative risk free rate. The Phase 2 amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with early application permitted. ING did not early adopt Phase 2 amendments in 2020. Refer to section 1.4.2 of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and accounting policies' of the financial statements.\n\n## Foreign exchange (FX) risk in banking books (*)\n\nFX exposures in banking books result from core banking business activities (business units doing business in currencies other than their base currency), foreign currency investments in subsidiaries (including realised net profit and loss), and strategic equity stakes in foreign currencies. The policy regarding these exposures is briefly explained below.\n\n## Governance -Core banking business (*)\n\nEvery business unit hedges the FX risk resulting from core banking business activities into its base currency. Consequently, assets and liabilities are matched in terms of currency.\n\n## Governance -FX translation result (*)\n\nING's strategy is to keep the target CET1 ratio within a certain range when FX rates fluctuate, while limiting volatility in the profit and loss account due to this CET1 hedging. Therefore, hedge accounting is applied to the largest extent possible. Taking this into account, the CET1 ratio hedge can be achieved by deliberately taking foreign currency positions equal to certain target positions, such that the target CET1 capital and risk-weighted assets are equally sensitive in relative terms to changing FX rates. For a selection of emerging market currencies ING decided not to enter into foreign currency hedges as allowed under the policy.\n\n## Risk profile -FX translation result (*)\n\nThe following table presents the currency exposures in the banking books for the most important currencies for the FX translation result. Positive figures indicate long positions in the respective currency. As a result of the strategy to hedge the CET1 ratio an open structural FX exposure exists.\n\nIn order to measure the sensitivity of the target CET1 ratio against FX rate fluctuations, an historical Value-at-Risk approach is used. It measures the drop in the CET1 ratio based on historical FX rates. The impact is taken into account under the solvency RAS.\n\n## Foreign currency exposures banking books (*)\n\n| in EUR million    | Foreign Investments   | Foreign Investments   |        | Hedges   | Net exposures   | Net exposures   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                   | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2020   | 2019     | 2020            | 2019            |\n| US Dollar 1       | 7,126                 | 8,031                 | -10    | -11      | 7,117           | 8,020           |\n| Pound Sterling 2  | 1,285                 | -22                   |        |          | 1,285           | -22             |\n| Polish Zloty      | 2,631                 | 2,522                 | -369   | -278     | 2,262           | 2,244           |\n| Australian Dollar | 3,544                 | 3,565                 | -2,269 | -2,033   | 1,275           | 1,532           |\n| Turkish Lira      | 1,078                 | 1,337                 |        |          | 1,078           | 1,337           |\n| Chinese Yuan      | 1,912                 | 2,255                 |        |          | 1,912           | 2,255           |\n| Russian Rouble    | 344                   | 540                   | -126   | -85      | 218             | 455             |\n| Other currency    | 5,992                 | 4,742                 | -3,456 | -1,834   | 2,536           | 2,907           |\n| Total             | 23,913                | 22,969                | -6,231 | -4,242   | 17,683          | 18,727          |\n\n- 1 US Dollar net exposure move is mainly driven by EURUSD FX rate.\n- 2 The net exposure move in Pound Sterling is related to capital injection in UK Branch.",

Financial Risk is responsible for monitoring the regulatory capital for equity investments on a monthly basis and acts independently from ING / local management when monitoring these positions.\n\n## Risk Profile (*)\n\nEquity price risk arises from the possibility that an equity security's price will fluctuate, affecting the values of the equity security itself as well as other instruments whose value react similarly to the particular security, a defined basket of securities, or a securities index. ING's equity exposure mainly consists of the investments in associates and joint ventures of EUR 1,475 million (2019: EUR 1,790 million) and equity securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of EUR 1,862 million (2019: EUR 2,306 million). The value of equity securities held at FVOCI is directly linked to equity security prices with increases/decreases being recognised in the revaluation reserve.

Systematic validation processes are in place to validate the accuracy and internal consistency of data and parameters used for the internal models and modelling processes.\n\n## Value at Risk (*)\n\nFI-FM Risk uses the historical simulation VaR methodology (HVaR) as its primary risk measure. The HVaR for market risk quantifies, with a one-sided confidence level of 99%, the maximum overnight loss that could occur in the trading portfolio of ING due to changes in risk factors (e.g. interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, implied volatilities) if positions remain unchanged for a time period of one day. Next to general market movements in these risk factors, HVaR also takes into account market data movements for specific moves in e.g. the underlying issuer of securities. A single model that diversifies general and specific risk is used. In general, a full revaluation approach is applied, and for a limited number of linear trading positions and risk factors in commodity and equity risk classes a sensitivity-based approach is applied. The potential impact of historical market movements on today's portfolio is es timated, based on equally weighted observed market movements of the previous year (260 days). When simulating potential movements in risk factors, depending on the risk factor type, either an absolute or a relative shift is used. The data used in the computations is updated daily. ING uses HVaR with a one-day horizon for internal risk measurement, management control, and backtesting, and HVaR with a ten-day horizon for determining regulatory capital. To compute HVaR with a ten-day horizon the one-day risk factor shifts are scaled by the square root of ten and then used as an input for the revaluation. The same model is used for all legal entities within ING with market risk exposure in the trading portfolio.\n\n## Limitations (*)\n\nHVaR has some limitations: HVaR uses historical data to forecast future price behaviour, but future price behaviour could differ substantially from past behaviour. Moreover, the use of a one-day holding period (or ten days for regulatory capital calculations) assumes that all positions in the portfolio can be liquidated or hedged in one day. In periods of illiquidity or market events, this assumption may not hold. Also, the use of a 99% confidence level means that HVaR does not take into account any losses that occur beyond this confidence level.\n\n## Backtesting (*)\n\nBacktesting is a technique for the ongoing monitoring of the plausibility of the HVaR model in use. Although HVaR models estimate potential future trading results, estimates are based on historical market data. In a backtest, the actual daily trading result (excluding fees and commissions) is compared with the one-day HVaR. In addition to using actual results for backtesting, ING also uses hypothetical results, which exclude the effects of intraday trading, fees, and commissions. When an actual or a hypothetical loss exceeds the HVaR, an 'outlier' occurs. Based on ING's one -sided confidence level of 99%, an outlier is expected once in every 100 business days. On an overall level in 2020 there were four outliers for hypothetical P&L and five outliers for actual P&L. Following the approval of ECB, the March 2020 backtest outliers caused by market volatility of Covid-19 has been excluded from capital multiplier calculations as of 30 June 2020. This applies to four hypothetical and four actual outliers for ING Group. ING reports backtesting results on a quarterly basis to the ECB.\n\n## Stressed HVaR (*)\n\nThe Stressed HVaR (SVaR) is intended to replicate the HVaR calculation that would be generated on the bank's current portfolio with inputs calibrated to the historical data from a continuous 12 -month period of significant financial stress relevant to the bank's portfolio. To calculate SVaR, ING uses the same model that is used for 1DHVaR, with a ten-day horizon. The data for the historical stress period used currently includes the height of the credit crisis around the fall of Lehman Brothers, and this choice is reviewed regularly. The historical data period is chosen so that it gives the worst scenario loss estimates for the current portfolio. The same SVaR model is used for management purposes and for regulatory purposes. The same SVaR model is used for all legal entities within ING with market risk exposure in the trading portfolio.",

The same IRC model is used for all legal entities within ING with market risk exposure in the trading portfolio. Trading positions (excluding securitisations) of ING, which are subject to specific interest rate risk included in the internal model approach for market risk regulatory capital, are in scope of the IRC model. By model choice, equity is excluded from the model. For the calculation of IRC, ING performs a Monte-Carlo simulation based on a Gaussian copula model. The asset correlations used in the Gaussian copula model are determined using the IRB correlation formula. The rating change is simulated for all issuers over the different liquidity horizons (i.e. time required to liquidate the position or hedge all significant risks) within one year. Movements across different rating categories and probabilities of default are governed by a credit-rating transition matrix. An external transition matrix is obtained from Standard & Poor's (S&P). The financial impact is then determined for the simulated migration to default, or for the simulated migration to a different rating category, based on LGD or credit spread changes, respectively.\n\nThe liquidity horizon has been set to the regulatory minimum of three months for all positions in scope. ING reviews the liquidity horizons regularly based on a structured assessment of the time it takes to liquidate the positions in the trading portfolio.\n\nING periodically assesses the compliance of the IRC model with regulatory requirements by performing gap analyses, substantiating the modelling choices, and quantifying the impact of alternative approaches.\n\n## Stress testing and event risk (*)\n\nStress testing and event risk are valuable risk management tools. In addition to the bank-wide stress test framework as described in the stress-testing section, FI-FM Risk performs additional assessments, specific to the Trading Book, with various frequencies: sensitivity analyses (single-risk factor and multirisk factor), ad-hoc stress tests (e.g. Covid-19 scenarios) and structured stressed scenario tests under the event risk framework - to monitor market risks under extreme market conditions. Event risk is calculated because HVaR in general does not produce an estimate of the potential losses that can occur as a result of extreme market movements, i.e. beyond the confidence level. Event risk evaluates the bank's financial stability under severe but plausible stress scenarios and assists in decision -making aimed at maintaining a financially healthy going-concern institution after a severe event occurs. Event risk is based on historical as well as hypothetical extreme scenarios. The result is an estimate of the profit and loss caused by a potential event and its worldwide impact for ING. The event risk number for ING trading activity is generated on a weekly basis. As with HVaR, the risk appetite for event risk is limited by ALCO Bank.\n\nING's event risk policy is based on a large set of possible stress scenarios per risk type. In stress scenarios, shocks are applied to prices (credit spreads, interest rates, equity, commodities, and fx rates) and volatilities. Depending on the type of the stress test, additional scenario assumptions can be made, for example on correlations, dividends, or recovery rates. For equity products, for example, both a crisis scenario (prices decrease) as well as a bull scenario (prices increase) are assumed. Scenarios are calculated based on events happening independently, jointly by region, or in all countries simultaneously. This way, for each risk type, a large set of scenarios is calculated. The worst scenarios per market are combined across markets by assessing both independent events per market, and the worst events happening in all markets at the same time.\n\n## Other trading controls\n\nHVaR and event risk limits are the most important limits to control the trading portfolios. Additionally, limits have been set on SVaR and IRC. Furthermore, ING uses a variety of other controls to supplement these limits. Position and sensitivity limits are used to prevent large concentrations in specific issuers, sectors, or countries. Moreover, other risk limits are set with respect to the activities in complex derivatives trading. The market risk of these products is controlled by product-specific limits and constraints.",

Therefore, diversification is not calculated for the minimum and maximum categories.\n\n3   CVA risk is not included in VaR.\n\nAverage 1D/10D HVaR, 10D SVaR over 2020 increased compared to 2019, due to the increase in market volatility, while IRC remained in line with 2019. The average for interest rate and credit spread increased compared to 2019, both driven mainly by market movements. The VaR at the period end of 2020 increased to 22 mln from 13 mln at period end of 2019, the main driver of the move was the increased market volatility throughout 2020. The main components of the risk were interest rate and credit spread.\n\n## Risk profile\n\nThe following chart shows the development of the overnight HVaR under a 99% confidence level and a one-day horizon versus actual and hypothetical daily trading profits and losses. In calculation of the hypothetical daily profit and loss, the trading position is kept constant and only the market movement is taken into account. The overnight HVaR is presented for the ING trading portfolio from 2015 to 2020. In the graph below, it can be seen that the market volatility in March 2020 lead to a sharply increased HVaR as the new scenarios entered the 1 year history. In addition it shows significant P&L volatility with the largest loss coming from a significant increase in Valuation Adjustments booked end of March 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1  CVA risk is not included in VaR.\n\nThe risk figures in the backtesting graph above and in the table below relate to all trading books for which the internal model approach is applied, i.e. all trading books, including Credit Exposure Management books.",

ING received regulatory approval to use an internal model to determine the regulatory capital for the market risk in all trading books of ING. Market risk capital of trading books is calculated according to the CRR, using internal HVaR, SVaR, and IRC models, where diversification is taken into account. Capital for foreign exchange risk from the banking books and for collective investment undertakings (CIUs) exposures in trading books are calculated using the standardised approach with\n\nfixed risk weights. ING does not have a correlation trading portfolio or any other securitisations in the trading book.\n\n## Standardised approach\n\n| in EUR million                              | 2020  Capital   | requireme   | 2020  Capital   | 2019  Capital  requireme   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------|\n|                                             | RWA             | nts         | RWA             | nts                        |\n| Outright products                           |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 1 Interest rate risk (general and specific) | 2               | 0           | 14              | 1                          |\n| 2 Equity risk (general and specific)        |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 3 Foreign exchange risk                     |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 4 Commodity risk                            |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| Options                                     |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 5 Simplified approach                       |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 6 Delta-plus method                         |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 7 Scenario approach                         |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 8 Securitization (specific risk)            |                 |             |                 |                            |\n| 9  Total                                    | 2               | 0           | 14              | 1                          |\n\nThe MRWA under standardised approach slightly decreased compared to end of 2019. The FX exposure continued to be lower than the 2% own funds threshold. According to Art. 351 CRR, in such a case, the calculation of Market Risk regulatory capital is not required. As of the third quarter of 2020, collective investment undertakings are capitalised in market risk under standardised approach under interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\n\n## Internal model approach\n\nMarket risk regulatory capital increased during 2020 compared to 2019. The increase is driven by an increase in HVaR and SVaR due to increased market volatility as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, while IRC slightly decreased.",

Sensitivities measure the impact of movements in individual market risk factors (foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity, and commodity prices) on profit and loss results of the trading positions and portfolios.\n\nThe following tables show the five largest trading positions in terms of sensitivities to foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread risk factor movements. These largest exposures also reflect\n\nconcentrations of risk in FX risk per currency, interest rate risk per currency, and credit spread risk per country, rating and sector. Due to the nature of the trading portfolios, positions in the portfolios can change significantly from day to day, and sensitivities of the portfolios can change daily accordingly.\n\n| in EUR million        | 2020                       | 2019   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------|\n| Foreign exchange      | Foreign exchange           |        |\n| US Dollar             | 203  US Dollar             | 116    |\n| Chinese Yuan Renminbi | -63  Chinese Yuan Renminbi | -21    |\n| Japanese Yen          | -44  South Korean Won      | 20     |\n| British Pound         | -37  Brazilian Real        | -15    |\n| Romanian Leu          | -16  Japanese Yen          | -10    |\n\n| in EUR thousand         | 2020                    | 2019   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------|\n| Interest Rate (BPV)  1  | Interest Rate (BPV)  1  |        |\n| Euro                    | -787  Euro              | -740   |\n| US Dollar               | -319  US Dollar         | -325   |\n| British Pound           | -120  Russian Ruble     | -105   |\n| Russian Ruble           | -86  British Pound      | -68    |\n| Australian Dollar       | -64  Australian Dollar  | -31    |\n| Credit Spread (CSO1)  2 | Credit Spread (CSO1)  2 |        |\n| Germany                 | 134  United States      | 360    |\n| Republic of Korea       | -129  Germany           | 163    |\n| United States           | 118  France             | 117    |\n| Belgium                 | 115  Russian Federation | 73     |\n| Netherlands             | 50  United Kingdom      | 72     |",

ALCO Bank has delegated the responsibilities concerning the Internal Capital and Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ICLAAP) and documents, as per the ICLAAP framework of ING, to the ICLAAP Committee. The ICLAAP Committee therefore focuses on technical liquidity documents and oversees business processes and deliverables concerning ILAAP. The EB, MBB, staff departments from the CRO and CFO domain as well as Group Treasury have oversight of and are responsible for managing funding and liquidity risks.\n\nING's funding and liquidity risk governance is based on the three lines of defence structure to ensure a clear division of responsibilities as well as an independent risk control challenging process.\n\nGroup Treasury and the business lines have the first line of defence functions. Group Treasury's main respons ibility is to manage ING's (regulatory) liquidity and funding position by executing ING's funding plan, maintaining access to both the short- and the long-term professional funding markets and managing the liquidity buffer. Business lines are responsible for managing the funding and liquidity positions from the originated business, a large part of which is replicated with Group Treasury.\n\nAt the second line of defence, Financial Risk is responsible for developing and maintaining ING's policies, standards and guidelines on F&L risk management as well as for setting the F&L risk appetite. Furthermore, the Financial Risk function measures funding and liquidity risks, executes stress testing, provides management information and controls the liquidity and funding requirements on commercial products. The Finance function is responsible for management information and regulatory reporting related to funding and liquidity risk management.\n\nFor the third line of defence Corporate Audit Services is responsible for independently assessing the design, effectiveness and implementation of the funding and liquidity framework.\n\n## Funding and liquidity management strategy and objectives (*)\n\nThe main objective of ING's funding and liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund the commercial activities of ING both under normal and stressed market circumstances across various geographies, currencies and tenors. This requires a diversified funding structure considering relevant opportunities and constraints.\n\nING's funding consists mainly of retail and corporate deposits contributing around 50 percent and 20 percent of total funding respectively. These funding sources provide a relatively stable funding base. The remainder of the required funding is attracted primarily through a combination of long-term and short-term professional funding. Group Treasury manages the professional funding in line with the F&L risk appetite to ensure a sufficiently diversified and stable funding base.\n\n## Funding mix 1 (*)\n\n|                               | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Funding type                  |        |        |\n| Customer deposits (retail)    | 52%    | 51%    |\n| Customer deposits (corporate) | 20%    | 21%    |\n| Interbank                     | 9%     | 5%     |\n| Lending/repurchase agreement  | 6%     | 5%     |\n| CD/CP                         | 2%     | 5%     |\n| Long-term senior debt         | 9%     | 11%    |\n| Subordinated debt             | 2%     | 2%     |\n| Total                         | 100%   | 100%   |\n\n- 1  Liabilities excluding trading securities and IFRS equity\n\nING's long -term professional funding is well diversified across maturities and currencies. The main part of it is EUR and USD denominated which is in line with the currency composition of customer lending. The increase in 'Interbank' funding type is related to ING's participation in the TLTRO III.",

A liquidity adequacy statement is formulated at least quarterly to substantiate and reflect the management's view on the current funding and liquidity position as well as the potential future challenges. The quarterly adequacy statement is an important part of ING's ILAAP process.\n\nING assesses its F&L adequacy through three lenses -stress, sustainability and regulatory:\n\n- \u25aa ING evaluates its ability to withstand a period of prolonged F&L stress (idiosyncratic, market-wide, combined idiosyncratic and market-wide) which is characterised by customer deposit outflows, deterioration of funding markets access and lower liquidity value of the counterbalancing capacity;\n- \u25aa ING assesses the extent to which its customers, professional counterparties and investors are comfortable with extending funding in tenors, currencies and instruments necessary to sustainably fund ING under a going-concern situation;\n- \u25aa ING ascertains that it is in a position to meet both current and future regulatory requirements.\n\nFor each lens, ING has established a related set of risk appetite statements which define ING's risk appetite commensurate with the principles of liquidity adequacy. These risk appetite statements are summarised in the next graph.",

Regarding the sustainability perspective, an internally defined stable funding to loans (SFL) ratio (supplemented by other metrics) is used to ensure a diversified funding base and to prevent overreliance on professional funding. Finally, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) regulatory metrics are monitored in terms of both ING's risk appetite and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe LCR compares the volume of available high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to net outflows (outflows minus inflows) over a 30day stress scenario defined by the regulator. ING's liquidity buffer forms a part of the counterbalancing capacity which serves as a liquidity cushion under normal and stressed conditions.\n\nThe liquidity buffer consists mainly of Level 1 assets such as government and central bank assets and are of the highest liquidity quality. Only assets that are freely available (not pledged under existing contracts) for liquidity purposes are included in the buffer. The size and composition of the liquidity buffer are driven by ING's internal risk appetite limits as well as by regulatory requirements.\n\nThe macroeconomic and market environment are also i mportant considerations in ING's funding and liquidity framework.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment comprises various exogenous factors over which ING has no control but which may have a material impact on ING's F&L position. The main macroeconomic factors analysed on a regular basis include:\n\n- \u25aa Global and local economic performance: e.g. shifts in GDP, inflation rate, unemployment rates and public deficit/surplus;\n- \u25aa Changing geopolitical trends;\n- \u25aa Monetary policy with a focus on the unconventional monetary measures employed by central banks in recent years including the measures taken since the start of the Covid-19 crisis; and\n- \u25aa Regulatory requirements: e.g. understanding the changing regulatory landscape as well as the impact of ING's actions on existing reg ulatory boundaries.\n\nThe strategic ambitions of ING, together with the design and execution of the funding plan, are assessed under both current and projected market conditions. Key emphasis is placed on understanding overall market trends and developments, credit rating changes and peer comparison.\n\nThe 'time to survive' in a F&L stress situation must be sufficient",

        "page_content": "- > Funding & liquidity risk\n\n## Liquidity stress testing (*)\n\nFunding and liquidity stress testing forms part of the overall F&L framework. It allows ING to examine the effects of exceptional but plausible future events on ING's liquidity position and provides insight into which entities, business lines or portfolios are vulnerable to which types of risk or scenarios.\n\nThe stress-testing framework encompasses the funding and liquidity risks of the consolidated balance sheet of ING Group including all entities, business lines as well as on and off-balance sheet positions. The net liquidity position and time-to-survive are the two main stress-testing measures. Both measures may be impacted differently under specific F&L stress scenarios and parameterisation.\n\nThe stress-testing framework considers idiosyncratic, market-wide and combined (idiosyncratic plus market-wide) stress scenarios. Moreover, it differentiates between stress events that develop in a gradual and in a fast manner. The design of the framework is based on empirical evidence supplemented by expert judgment. The framework can be extended to additional ad hoc scenarios. For example, it can be used as input for firm-wide stress testing and reverse stress testing.\n\nIn response to the Covid-19 crisis, ING has developed a dedicated corona liquidity stress-test framework that focuses on the key vulnerabilities of the crisis a nd their potential impact on ING's net liquidity position and LCR. The current framework calculates the impact of severe macroeconomic stress combined with turmoil on financial markets due to a prolonged lockdown.\n\nThe outcomes of the stress testing are t aken into account in all the key aspects of ING's F&L risk framework and F&L risk management:\n\n- \u25aa Risk Appetite Framework (through risk appetite statements);\n- \u25aa risk identification and assessment;\n- \u25aa monitoring the liquidity and funding position;\n- \u25aa business actions (if needed);\n- \u25aa contingency funding plan; and\n- \u25aa early warning indicators.\n\nThe funding and liquidity stress-testing framework is also subject to regular internal validation.\n\nIn line with supervisory expectations, ING's liquidity position is stress tested at least monthly using scenarios that form part of the F&L risk appetite statement. In addition, the results of all internal stress scenarios are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. They also serve as input in the decision on additional contingency measures.\n\nContingent F&L risks are addressed in the contingency funding plan with a focus on early warning indicators as well as organisation and planning of liquidity management in times of stress. The contingency funding measures are developed in conjunction with the ING Recovery Plan and are tested on a regular basis.",

The G20 Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Working Group has outlined a set of principles for financial entities, while the European Commission released an Action Plan for Financing Sustainable Growth and most recently, the new Green Deal, which provides an action plan to boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy, restoring biodiversity and cutting pollution. Since the introduction of the United Nations Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises there is a clear shift towards a more regulated environment and impact management on social risks. Legislation aimed at preventing human rights violations along the supply chain is being introduced in several countries, including a proposal at EU level for mandatory human rights due diligence.\n\nOther key developments in the regulatory landscape include the latest EU Taxonomy Regulation that requires compliance to minimum social and governance safeguards and the EBA consultation on ESG risks launched recently which aims to incorporate ESG risks into the governance, risk management and supervision of credit institutions and investment firms. The effects of the recent pandemic also bring a renewed focus on the importance of health and safety measures on the ground for the projects we finance as well as for the workforce of our clients.\n\nSince 2017, ING has been communicating its progress on climate risks and opportunities according to the TCFD in its Annual Report. Further, ING has set its climate risk management ambition based on other relevant materials, such as the ECB's recent Guide on Climate -related and Environmental risks. This includes integrating climate change as part of our risk appetite framework. We plan to commence integrating this progressively in the second half of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on Human Rights (DBA) was successfully completed in 2019. ING updated its human rights policy to reflect its commitment to the United Nations Guiding Principles, and improved transparency through regular human rights reporting. We continue to work within the framework of this agreement; we are currently in the process of developing a tool that will help assess portfolio and client exposure to salient human rights issues, enabling identification of issues and client engagement. The tool is expected to be launched in 2021.\n\nDuring 2020, ING has also cooperated with other banks and the Equator Principles (EP) working groups on the implementation of the EP 4, which brings a new set of requirements related to human rights, climate change, biodiversity and impacts on Indigenous Peoples.\n\n## The ESR Framework\n\nING's ESR policy framework helps us make transparent choices about how, where and with whom we do business. In 2019 we released the updated ESR Framework based on input from internal as well as external stakeholders while during 2020 we also made several updates, which are briefly summarised in the next section. Through these regular updates we keep abreast of social norms and regulation relating to sustainability and challenge our own increasingly strong commitments on the topics of human rights and climate change.\n\n## ESR in practice in 2020\n\nThe ESR policy framework includes standards and best practice guidance for ESR-sensitive sectors. It includes explicit restrictions on activities not in line with ING's values and harmful to people or the environment (for example companies involved in clearance of primary forest), which we do not finance.\n\nThe next table gives insight into the ESR policies that are part of the ESR framework and where they are applied.",

Generation.\n\nThe way the ESR Framework is applied in practice differs per product type. The largest potential environmental and social impacts come from large corporates within our Wholesale Banking (WB) segment. WB is therefore the primary focus of our assessments and where we promote active ESR dialogue and knowledge sharing. We have been working with wholesale clients for more than 15 years to support them in understanding and managing their environmental and social impact. A simplified\n\nversion of the ESR policy fram ework, following the same rationale and principles, applies to ING's mid -corporate and small medium enterprise client segments. The ESR framework minimum requirements are also included in ING's procurement policy and apply to the screening of suppliers of ING's global procurement activities.\n\nThe ESR policy framework is incorporated in ING's KYC policy framework, meaning the ESR client assessment is part of regular client on-boarding and review. The ESR policy framework also triggers a dedicated ESR transaction assessment to corporate clients which will indicate if such transaction is categorised as ' ESR high risk ' , and thus require a separate in-depth advice from the ESR team.\n\nWhile we have a strong ESR policy framework and made progress in enhancing the automation of the checks and controls in the ESR assessment processes, we acknowledge that we need to further improve our processes in order to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data.\n\nOf all Wholesale Banking engagements in scope of the ESR policy framework in 2020, 83 percent were considered ESR low-risk, 8 percent ESR medium-risk and 9 percent ESR high-risk. ESR high-risk cases require specialised advice from the global ESR team. The team now consists of 11 dedicated ESR advisors, 10 of whom are in Amsterdam and one in Geneva. The ESR advice assesses the specific product offered and environmental and social impacts associated with it, the sector, operating context and geography of the engagement and other relevant factors. Based on this in-depth research, a binding advice is given that can only be overruled at Global Credit Committee level. Of the 292 ESR advices given in 2020, which are related to new requests, 60 percent were positive, 25 percent positive subject to conditions and 15 percent negative. Conditions can play an important role in helping clients transition towards improved environmental and social performance on the ground.\n\nThe ESR team mainly focuses on policy development and transaction advisory. However the team also provides training (both in-person and via webinars) to hundreds of colleagues around the world every year in risk, front-office, KYC and compliance teams, so that ESR knowledge is built on and spread.\n\n## Key updates to the ESR framework\n\nThe renewed ESR framework incorporates the updates that took place in December 2019 and July 2020, respectively. The new release, includes the following updates in the policy:",

For more information please see the ESR framework published on the corporate website ing.com.\n- \u25aa Equator Principles: We have adopted EP4 in line with the new updated EP guidelines.\n\nIn 2020, the ESR team, together with the retail business, started the implementation of a new ESR selfdeclaration approach for business banking. The concept is already approved by GCTP and it entails an alternative ESR client assessment implementation for business banking clients where lending and presettlement limits exceed \u20ac 1 million and where the client is active in any of the pre-identified sectors (e.g. employment agencies). Such clients will be required to confirm their compliance with specific statements related to safeguarding labour rights and/or environmental regulations that are specific for that sector. The implementation of this initiative is expected to be finalised in 2021.\n\nFollowing any key ESR policy updates on restrictions, we engage with affected existing clients and provide them with the opportunity to reduce their exposure to the new restrictions; in case a reduction is not feasible, we implement an exit strategy.\n\n## Developing international best practice and stakeholder engagement\n\nOur ESR approach helps us and our clients to gradually enhance the implementation of key standards like the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. But beyond stimulating better environmental and social performance in our own portfolio, ING actively collaborates with other institutions, peers and regulators to address the environmental, social and human rights challenges we face:\n\n- \u25aa ING and the Equator Principles (EPs): The EPs are an environmental and social risk management framework adopted by 110 financial institutions worldwide. The EPs were updated in 2019, and the new version (EP4) became effective in October 2020. EP4 contains new and stronger commitments on human rights, climate change, Indigenous Peoples and biodiversity, as well as an increased scope. ING is active in several EP working groups covering social risks, climate change and scope. ING also co-leads the capacity building and training workgroup, which is focussing on updating the EP learning tool with the changes included in EP4.\n\n- \u25aa The Covid-19 pandemic has also had material implications for our clients and peers to continually meet the environmental and social requirements of the EPs. ING participated in the development of a guidance note to provide practical guidelines for both Equator Principle financial institutions and clients on how to manage Covid-19 related risks to EP compliance.\n- \u25aa Dutch Banking Sector Agreement : The Dutch multi-stakeholder platform to implement the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on International Responsible Business Conduct Regarding Human Rights formally came to an end in December 2019. The agreement was in place for three years and was finalised with a conclusive report published in August 2020 and a closing statement confirming that all agreed deliverables were completed. During the period covered by the agreement, we updated our human rights policy and published ING's first human rights report in 2018. In 2019, we issued an update of the report, highlighting the pilot on proactive client engagement carried out and the actions resulting from this pilot. In 2020, a follow-up of the 2019 human rights report was shared, providing an update of the client engagement model presented in 2019 and the current human rights landscape.\n- \u25aa Thun Group : ING participates in the Thun Group, an informal group of banking representatives focusing on human rights. The group was initially established in 2011 to support the integration of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights into banking activities, and is now further evolving as a formal group promoting human rights and sharing best practices among its participant members.\n- \u25aa OECD : ING's active role in pro moting and integrating human rights is reflected in our participation as a formal advisory member to the OECD Working Party on responsible business conduct in our sector. In 2020 we started to develop the third and final OECD due-diligence guidance documentation for asset based finance transactions. This guidance is expected to be finalised in 2021. We also participated in the Export Credit Agencies annual meetings for practitioners from financial institutions where we actively promoted ING's ESR framework and due-diligence process with export credit agencies, EP financial institutions, commercial banks, and development institutions.\n\nBy taking part in the above-mentioned initiatives, we aim to contribute our viewpoint and those of our clients, employees and other stakeholders to help form a consensus and develop clear guidelines that can serve as a standard for our industry.",

We also have a role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. At ING, we have chosen an integrated strategy that allows us to translate the risks associated with climate change into opportunities.\n\nIn 2017, we started to develop in-house energy transition scenarios based on the drivers of policy and technology. These scenarios formed the basis for the energy transition assessment we undertook for particularly sensitive sectors within the Transportation, Industrials, Power and Real Estate sectors. ING is committed to continuously reviewing and monitoring its policies and strategies as climate-related risks and opportunities emerge. As a result of transition risk ING further refined its coal policy in 2017, targeting near-zero coal exposure by 2025.\n\nIn 2020, we published our second Terra Progress Report that provided an update on how we steer our lending portfolio in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement for all nice sectors in scope, including quantitative results. For an overview of how we capitalise on climate-related opportunities, please refer to Responsible Finance ( section 'Our performance and strategy' ).\n\n## Risk management\n\nAt ING we already have several processes in place to identify and assess climate-related risks. An example is our environmental and social risk (ESR) framework, including its climate change policy, reviewing risk on a client and transaction basis. We also monitor sector-specific developments associated with the energy transition. For upstream oil and gas, our credit assessments include a strong focus on production costs. By focusing on low-cost production, we work with our clients to ensure their businesses are resilient to the risk of stranded assets.\n\nIn the course of 2020, we worked on further identifying climate risk within our portfolio. We use scenarios to understand the various climate pathways that can potentially affect sectors. In addition, ING conducted an internal firm-wide stress test, including the assessment of both physical and transition risk. To better understand the potential impact across sectors we developed an initial transition risk heatmap. We also started to conduct pilots for specific portfolios, for instance on our global mortgages portfolio with the aim to identify potential exposure towards physical risks. These types of investigations can inform our approach towards incorporating climate risk in our risk management framework. For details please refer to our stand-alone ' Climate Risk Report 2020 ' published on our corporate website ing.com.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nWe have set climate-related targets in our lending portfolio. This includes exiting thermal coal by 2025 and steering our portfolio towards meeting the Paris Agreement's well -below two degree goal (Terra approach). Under Terra, we set one target per sector for each of the nine sectors. For details on the approach refer to our ' 2020 Terra Progress Report ' and f or our approach to setting opportunity-related metrics and targets please refer to ' Climate Finance ' both published on our corporate website ing.com . Within the UNEP FI TCFD project we worked towards methodologies to translate the impact of climate change on financial rations.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2021, we aim to further progress with our efforts regarding climate-related risks and opportunities by refining our methodologies, working towards standard setting and expanding the scope. For instance, we aim to expand the scope of our physical risk assessment for real estate and investigate the impact of transition risk on various sectors.",

The NFR function encompasses Operational Risk Management (ORM), Information Risk Management (IRM), the Independent Validation Unit (IVU),  Professional Practice Unit (ERM PPU) and Corporate Security & Investigations (CSI).\n\n## Governance\n\nThe head of Corporate ORM, Corporate IRM, IVU, CSI, ERM PPU and NFR Strategy, Central Services & Digitalisation Unit report to the global head of NFR, who directly reports to the chief risk officer. The global head of NFR is responsible for developing the framework of NFR policies and standards within ING, and for monitoring the quality of non-financial risk management in the ING entities.\n\n## Non-Financial risk measurement\n\nING uses an internal model in line with the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to determine the regulatory and economic capital amounts that are necessary to cover potential losses as a result of non-financial risks. This model predicts non-financial risk losses by combining a forward-looking and a backward-looking view on non-financial risk events. ING reports the outcome of its AMA model on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Risk categories\n\nING categorises non-financial risks in a number of areas:\n\n- \u25aa Information (technology) risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to breaches of confidentiality, integrity or availability within business processes, the supporting IT systems, of information or lack of information quality;\n- \u25aa Continuity risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to business disruptions (loss of people, processes, systems, data, premises);\n\n- \u25aa Control risk is the risks of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to ineffective organisational structures and governance procedures (including unclear roles and responsibilities and inadequate reporting structure);\n- \u25aa Processing risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to failed (transaction) processing (input, execution, output) or failing process management;\n- \u25aa Unauthorised activity risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to employees performing outside the normal course of their business, intentionally giving unauthorised approvals or overstepping their authority;\n- \u25aa Personal and physical security risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to criminal and environmental threats that might endanger the security or safety of ING personnel at work, people in ING locations, ING assets or assets entrusted to ING, people at ING event locations, or might have an impact on ING organisation's confidentiality, integrity or availability;\n- \u25aa Employment practice risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to acts that are inconsistent with employment, health and/or safety laws, regulations or agreements, from payment of personal injury claims, or from diversity/discrimination events; and\n- \u25aa Fraud is the deliberate abuse of procedures, systems, assets, data, products and/or services of ING by those who intend to deceitfully or unlawfully benefit themselves and/or others. This definition of fraud is specified in the following two categories of fraud: Internal fraud : acts of fraud which involves at least one internal party performed by or in collusion with an ING employee or agent with the consequence of financial loss, regulatory fines, litigation loss, business disruption and/or reputational damage for ING. External fraud : acts of fraud or scams by individuals and/or parties excluding ING staff (including contractors), with the consequence of financial loss, regulatory fines, litigation loss, business disruption and/or reputational damage for ING.",

To ensure this ING employees have put immediate focus on ensuring the bank's operational resilience and continuity. ING has mobili sed a global crisis management organisation -engaging with all ING entities worldwide -to monitor and manage Covid19 related operational, health and safety challenges. In the first weeks of 2020 the bank was able to transfer around 80% of its employees, including external employees, to a working-from-home (WFH) environment. Throughout the year, ING continued to monitor developments in employee well-being and local BCM threat levels and aimed to identify, monitor and manage Covid-19 related risks through specific risk assessments. In addition to internally focused risk assessments, risk assessments were also performed on critical suppliers of ING. The financial health of these suppliers has been monitored throughout the entire year.\n\n## Cybercrime and fraud\n\nControls and monitoring continue to be embedded in the organisation as part of the overall internal control framework and are continuously re-assessed against existing and new threats. The identification and monitoring of new threat actors and campaigns relevant to ING also informs this process as does the closer alignment between IT security and fraud teams. In addition, ING continues to strengthen its global cybercrime and fraud resilience through collaboration with financial industry peers, law enforcement authorities, government (e.g. National Cybersecurity Centre) and internet service providers (ISPs).\n\nGeneral concerns over the potential impact of insider threats continues to increase. However the impact of external instances or trends remain limited in the financial industry where collaboration within the sector is improving.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe further digitalisation of banking services, increasing electronic exchange of information via different consumer channels, use of and dependency on third-party vendors for services, and the implementation of PSD2 are likely to present ongoing cybercrime resilience, fraud management and IT-security challenges; both in the short- and medium-term as criminal actors target financial and sensitive (payment) data, such as customer user credentials outside the traditional banking environment. Sensitive (payment) or personal data can be obtained by criminals via social forums such as WhatsApp and by screen scraping user credentials when a fallback procedure within PSD2 is allowed. In 2020, these challenges have further increased due to Covid-19, which resulted in more sophisticated phishing attempts, improved social engineering fraud attempts, an increased risk of external fraud in the lending portfolio and people working from home.\n\nDealing with current and emerging fraud threats, especially given the ever-increasing use of digital and on-line banking, effectively requires continuous improvement of fraud management capabilities such as real-time transaction monitoring and response capabilities. In addition, better alignment and standardisation of cross-border fraud management across ING and related platforms as well as exchanging data cross border. With legislation such as EBA PSD2 and the continuing emphasis on duty of care, financial institutions are potentially becoming more and more responsible for losses incurred by clients, and taking on more of the burden of reclaiming those losses.\n\n## Data risk management\n\nThe drivers for ING's data management come from the Think Forward strategy, where data management is one of the key enablers, and from the increasing regulatory focus on data. ING has the enterprise data lake in place (part of the target infrastructure) and is implementing data management capabilities including data definitions, data quality, data governance and data ethics, for use by ING entities, to support, amongst others, statutory and regulatory reporting. ING is continuously improving its data governance, the execution of its data quality framework controls at a consistent level across the bank and prioritising the implementation of the target infrastructure to further simplify, standardise and modernise its activities.",

Its purpose is consistent with BCBS239's stipulation of 'strong governance' (Principle 1) as well as ING's own ambition of being a data -driven bank. The Global Data Committee, chaired by the CRO, oversees the global data function and its contribution to wider society by providing decisions, endorsements and priorities for ING's data management strategy and data-related initiatives.\n\n## Enterprise risk management\n\nThe enterprise risk management ('ERM') framework is the overarching risk management framework. ERM assembles common risk principles for all risk types and domains: financial, non-financial (including compliance and model risks) and strategic risks. It aims to ensure standardisation of all risk frameworks and applies to all businesses lines and entities across ING.\n\nIn 2020, the ERM Professional Practice Unit (PPU) was established to set standards for the management and implementation of the ERM framework and to assure consistent use of the policy governance and risk library for all risk domains within ING. The PPU is introducing ING's global documentation governance by providing definitions and guidance for global policy documentation and global policy development, update and approval processes.\n\n## User access management (UAM)\n\nUAM is one of the focus areas of ING and an important element in our control framework to mitigate the risk of unauthorised and / or inappropriate access to systems, processes and the data and information contained therein. Consequently, the UAM processes, controls and practices are periodically reviewed, tested, adapted and improved by a dedicated UAM team to address ongoing developments both within and outside ING. In 2020, ING continued to mature, with attention to tooling, standardisation and harmonisation of processes and workflows and further automation of UAM controls. This will continue in 2021.\n\n## Personal data protection\n\nAs per 25 May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective. ING is bound by the GDPR that affords greater protection to individuals and requires more control on data and transparency regarding the use of data by companies. In 2020, ING continued working on structural solutions to support further enhancing the data protection of our clients and employees.\n\n## Sourcing Risk\n\nIn 2019, a renewed sourcing policy became effective, outlining the inherent critical and high risks that can materialise during the sourcing life-cycle. In addition, a sourcing guideline was issued to support updated requirements, issued by EBA in 2019. The controls defined in the support control framework (SCF) sourcing have been implemented and tested. The scope of sourcing encompasses outsourcing to external providers as well as intra-group sourcing.\n\n## BCBS 239\n\nIn January 2013 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the Principles for Effective Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting (BCBS 239), which is adopted by the ECB and became effective for all Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) as of January 2016 and for all D-SIBs depending on the date of designation. In 2020, ING continued with the extension of scope, continuous implementation improvements and further embedding into business as usual.",

        "page_content": "- > Compliance risk\n\n## Compliance risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nCompliance risk is defined as a threat posed to ING's standing resulting from failure to act in line with applicable laws and regulations, internal r ules (including ING's Orange Code and global Code of Conduct) and/or societal expectations. A failure to adequately mitigate compliance risk may lead to damage to ING's reputation and/or legal/regulatory sanctions, and/or financial loss .\n\nThe mission of Compliance is to support ING in conducting its business activities in line with applicable laws and regulatio ns, taking into account ING's internal code of conduct and societal expectations. Compliance wants to drive compliance risk management by desire and design throughout the organisation, unleashing the power of our data, risk expertise, and people to keep the bank safe and sound, and help drive new and sustainable ways of doing business.\n\nWithin ING, compliance risks are defined as those risks that are within the scope of the ING Compliance Risk Catalogue. The following three risk categories apply:\n\n- \u25aa Financial crime risk refers to the risks of the bank's products and services being abused for illicit purpose generating or disguising financial and/or economic crimes (FEC).\n- \u25aa Conduct risk refers to the compliance risks arising from potential or perceived misconduct by ING or its employees towards its customers, market integrity, business partners and other stakeholders.\n- \u25aa Organisational risk refers to the compliance risks arising from actual, potential or perceived flaws in the way that ING is organised and structured including its regulatory and reporting framework.\n\n## Governance roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Compliance organisation (comprised of four roles: Group Compliance, business segment compliance, geographical compliance and country compliance) is part of ING's second line of defence refer to 'Risk Governance' . Group Compliance together with business segment compliance set the priorities, standards and boundaries for the business segments (Retail and Wholesale Banking). Geographical compliance (Challengers & Growth Markets / Wholesale Banking / Market Leaders) together with the functional lines in the countries are responsible for the execution of these priorities, standards and control framework, within the boundaries set.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate governance\n\nCompliance is tasked with instructing, advising, challenging and having oversight of the first line of defence in their management of compliance risks as well as raising awareness (via training and communication), influencing and stimulating a sound compliance risk culture. The scope of the compliance risks is outlined in the ING Compliance Risk Charter.\n\nCompliance is headed by the chief compliance officer (CCO) who reports directly to the CRO. The CCO has direct access to the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. The CCO and the chairman of the Risk Committee had regular bilateral consultations in 2020.\n\n## Update on key compliance matters\n\n## Strengthening the compliance function\n\nIn 2020 ING introduced measures to strengthen the compliance function. These measures were implemented as part of a multi-year, global compliance strategy and transformation programme that started in October 2019. The programme encompasses the whole compliance function and particularly aims at enhancing and integrating governance, an end-to-end framework and monitoring capabilities of the compliance function. As we operate in a dynamic and challenging environment we are continuously learning and improving while getting to a more sustainable and mature level within the compliance function.\n\n## Financial economic crime\n\nKnowing who we do business with helps us to prevent the financial system from being misused, and is an important obligation to help gain trust in the financial markets. As gatekeepers of the financial system we have an obligation to prevent criminals from misusing it or detect and respond when it is being misused. We believe we can be even more effective in safeguarding the financial system if we join forces and work with other banks and with national, European and global authorities and law enforcement agencies to tackle financial economic crime. In 2020, ING continued to execute and update policies and procedures to further enhance our know your customer (KYC) activities. In addition, ING set up a special taskforce to monitor transactions for financial economic crime related to Covid-19. ING is continuously working to strengthen its implementation of KYC and build sustainable KYC practices. One of the ways we do this is through our global KYC enhancement programme which aims to:",

In 2020, the FEC controls maturity programme (FCMP) was initiated in order to further mature the framework over time.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nAt ING we attach great importance to a sound risk culture. ING's risk culture determines the way in which employees identify, understand, discuss and act on the risks we are confronted with and the risks we take. In 2019, ING initiated a global risk culture project to understand and measure where our level on the mentioned aspects is. The Management Board Banking and Supervisory Board are closely involved in this project and are strongly committed to safeguarding a sound risk culture for ING. Key characteristics of ING's risk culture are :\n\n- \u25aa Our Orange Code and global Code of Conduct define the most essential conduct principles expected from ING employees in their daily activities; (see 'Conduct risk' )\n- \u25aa Our leadership plays an active role in offering an environment of open communication and challenge;\n- \u25aa Having a robust risk management framework is key;\n- \u25aa Managing non-financial risk is as important as managing financial risk;\n- \u25aa We take time to learn from best practices and incidents from the past;\n- \u25aa We all are accountable for sound risk management and take time to actively educate ourselves; and\n- \u25aa Our reward and remuneration system reflects our ING values and our desired risk culture.\n\nThe project includes specific enhancement assignments in areas such as monitoring risk culture, our escalation culture and further linking non-financial risk related topics to our purpose and strategy.\n\n## Risk culture\n\n## Leadership as mediating driver\n\n- \u00b7 Tone from the top/ Leading by example\n- \u00b7 Learning from experiences\n- \u00b7 Clear consequences\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RegTech\n\nThe large number of regulations impacting financial institutions shows no sign of slowing down, leading to an increasing need within the compliance function for innovative solutions to support our business processes. A notable area of interest is horizon scanning, covering the timely spotting of rules and regulations, identifying risks and obligations resulting from these regulations, and creating policies to support the organisation on being compliant. A wide range of innovative tooling (such as Ascent, SparQ, Corlytics) is being assessed for horizon scanning and interoperability of solutions is a key factor in our consideration.",

In response, ING is running a diverse portfolio of RegTech initiatives. This ranges from making investments (e.g. Ascent, Eigen), close collaboration on solutions (e.g. Privitar, DuCo, Regtek Solutions) and creation of home-grown solutions (e.g. CoorpID). Our focus is on RegTech solutions that create positive impact on compliance effectiveness and cost.\n\n## Financial crime risk and know your customer\n\nFinancial crime risk refers to the risk of the bank's products and services being abused for an illicit purpose; either generating or disguising FEC. Keeping ING safe, secure and compliant is a top priority. Know your customer (KYC) and financial crime compliance play a major role and aim to ensure we only engage and do business with people and companies that meet regulatory requirements and are within our risk appetite. This is important, not only for ING but for wider society, with governments around the globe having identified financial crime as a major concern in modern society.\n\nFighting financial crime in a constantly changing environment requires ongoing updates to regulations and requirements to keep banking safe. However, according to the European Banking Authority, increased regulations and scrutiny can also have unintended consequences, with some customers and clients no longer being able to get their financial needs met.\n\n## KYC policy framework\n\nING strives to play its part in safeguarding the integrity of the financial system by combatting financial crime through utilisation of an overarching policy and control framework which is continuously enhanced. The KYC policy and related control standards (the KYC policy framework) set the minimum requirements and control objectives for all ING entities to guard against involvement in financial crime activity. The KYC policy Framework reflects relevant national and international laws, regulations, guidance documents and guidelines from national, European and international authorities, (supra)national risk assessments, and industry standards related to:\n\n- \u25aa financial economic crime, covering money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, export trade controls, proliferation financing, sanctions (economic, financial and trade), countries designated by ING as ultra-high-risk countries (UHRC)\n- \u25aa customer tax compliance, covering customer tax integrity (CTI), FATCA, CRS, mandatory disclosure requirements (MDR)\n\n- \u25aa environmental and social risk (ESR) client assessment, specifically the initial customer screening for environmental and social risk. For more information see the Credit risk chapter.\n\nThe KYC policy framework is mandatory and applies to all ING entities (i.e. all branches and majorityowned subsidiaries of ING Groep N.V. (including ING Bank N.V.) or where ING exercises control), their corporate functions and their branches, including outsourcing partners to whom ING entities have sourced KYC-related responsibilities. The KYC policy framework also reflects relevant national and international laws, regulations and industry standards related to business partners and overarching requirements with regards to record retention, training and awareness. ING entities have local procedures in place, aimed at enabling them to comply with local laws and regulations and the KYC policy framework. Where local laws and regulations are more stringent, these have to be applied.\n\nAs a result of frequent evaluation of the businesses from economic, strategic and risk perspectives, ING continues to believe that for business reasons doing business involving certain specified countries should be discontinued. In that respect, ING has a policy not to enter into new relationships with clients from these countries and processes remain in place to discontinue existing relationships involving these countries. At present, these countries are Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and Crimea region.\n\n## KYC enhancement programme\n\nING is continuously working to strengthen its implementation of KYC and build sustainable KYC practices. One of the ways we do this is through our global KYC enhancement programme which aims to:\n\n- \u25aa Improve customer due diligence files (documentation, data and identity verification), assess selected past transactions and report on unusual activities should these be identified.\n- \u25aa Make structural improvements in five areas: policy and risk appetite statements, digital tooling, governance, monitoring and screening, and KYC knowledge and behaviour.",

We also updated our ESR framework to incorporate new policies on human rights, climate change and financing infrastructure projects. This framework updates and standardises our policies by expanding the list of restricted activities ING will not finance. It also clarifies roles, responsibilities as well as the products and clients in scope.\n\nIn addition, we refreshed and further enhanced our systematic integrated risk analysis (SIRA). This allows us to measure and monitor adherence to our KYC risk appetite and ensures consistent KYC integrity risk assessments across the bank. Our risk appetite statements (RAS) which incorporate ING's risk appetite and tolerance towards KYC integrity risks were also updated.\n\nWe changed the structure of our global KYC organisation introducing three pillars that oversee customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and screening. Each pillar has a dedicated team with expert leads. This brings greater focus, strengthens steering and ensures end-to-end responsibility.\n\nWe also continued to introduce uniform global transaction monitoring solutions in 2020. These include standardised transaction monitoring tooling, supported by risk-based scenarios, handling alerts and reporting suspicious activities where required. The countries in scope have been connected to our global pre-transaction screening tool. Our adverse media screening tool is now available in most of the countries and will be available across the network of countries in early 2021. This allows us to continuously screen customers against news intelligence related to financial and economic crime. We implemented continuous name screening in several countries. Substituting local tools with centralised global tools enables us to further improve the way we onboard, monitor and screen customers using a consistent approach across the world.\n\nWe have also established a financial economic crime Covid-19 taskforce within ING aimed at identifying potential criminal schemes and assessing if the coronavirus pandemic influenced payment patterns or created new channels for money laundering. The taskforce worked with other parts of the bank to protect customers from fraud and further strengthen cybersecurity, during the pandemic. It also identified and analysed new behavioural patterns of customers in the Netherlands, which resulted in new cases of unusual transactions being reported. These findings are used to determine if similar patterns exist in other ING countries.\n\nIn 2020, five Dutch banks, including ING, proceeded with Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL), following a successful proof of concept that explored the feasibility and effectiveness of joint transaction monitoring. Monitoring transactions with a combined database provides greater insights into potential criminal money flows and networks, which will further boost monitoring and alert detection.\n\nSimilarly, we are working with four banks and payment provider Isabel Group in Belgium to use the blockchain application KUBE to share corporate data as part of the KYC process. KUBE is currently being built and is expected to be operational next year, and will help streamline the verification and maintenance of corporate identities.\n\nIn Germany, ING joined the public-private partnership Anti-Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA) to foster mutual exchange of information within the financial system. The alliance consists of 30 members, amongst them public authorities, the largest financial institutions as well as representatives from the real estate sector.\n\n## Digitalisation and innovation\n\nCriminals are harnessing technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to become ever more sophisticated. These same technologies can also help us to counter this threat. For example, Hunter is an AI-powered anti-money laundering tool that has the predictive capability to detect (emerging) suspicious patterns and entities. It helps identify clients with a high concentration of suspicious behaviour and points out hidden relationships, delivering on the promise to always be a step ahead. And we've developed a centralised digital vault where corporate clients can store and share their KYC documentation in a secure way. Similarly, the ING Lab in Singapore is working on a tool to help banks that serve other financial institutions eradicate the duplication of KYC documentation.\n\n## Knowledge and behaviour\n\nIncreasing our knowledge of KYC, providing training and carrying out behavioural risk assessments aimed at detecting impeding behavioural patterns and intervening where necessary is also key.",

The scope of the problem was illustrated in media reports in September 2020, in which several banks, including ING, were mentioned in respect of SARs filed some years ago.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate governance\n\n- > Compliance risk\n\nA global KYC academy was set up last year to equip employees with the skills and knowledge they need to effectively protect customers, the bank and society against financial economic crimes. This year, the academy partnered with ACAMS (Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists) and developed learning modules for employees working on KYC to raise their KYC awareness. Almost 8,000 employees enrolled for these modules. Trainings on sanctions also took place.\n\nBehavioural risk assessments were carried out to identify impeding behavioural patterns and their drivers and give direction to any necessary interventions. Since 2018, several KYC teams in various business lines have been assessed.\n\nLeadership labs (workshops with senior leaders) were organised in APAC, EMEA and Americas to address impeding behavioural patterns identified in the assessments and develop the right conditions to manage risks.\n\nWe also conducted two Nudge Labs this year for Wholesale Banking globally, developing subtle triggers that encourage desired behaviours to further strengthen our KYC processes and execution. Cocreated by our Wholesale Banking and behavioural risk experts, the Nudge Labs are another follow-up from our KYC behavioural risk assessments.\n\n## Staying safe, secure and compliant\n\nAs a gatekeeper to the financial system, we have an important role in the collective fight against financial economic crimes. By performing customer due diligence and monitoring transactions we aim to detect and prevent the financial system from being misused in criminal activities, including money laundering and terrorist financing, for the safety and security of our customers and society. We take this responsibility extremely seriously. As part of our ongoing anti-money laundering efforts, we assess relationships with customers and screen transactions. Potentially unusual/suspicious transactions are reviewed and, where applicable, reported to the relevant authorities. Over the past few years, we have increasingly discontinued customer relationships which do not fit our risk profile. This approach is also applied to acquisitions such as Payvision. ING was aware when it acquired Payvision that its customer base partly did not meet I NG's desired risk profile. Hence, arrangements were made during the acquisition to exit customers in t he 'adult' entertainment and gambling segments. Steps were also needed to better align Payvision with ING's risk profile, strengthening Payvision's govern ance, policies and processes. For example, Payvision's risk and compliance functions were reinforced, its chief risk officer is now a member of its board and there is a formal programme in place, including governance, to ensure that Payvision's compliance meets requirements. The programme involves a series of initiatives, including working on various structural improvements in compliance, tooling, monitoring, governance, knowledge and conduct.\n\nIn September 2020, Banca d'Italia announced that the ban on onb oarding new customers at ING in Italy, imposed in March 2019 was removed. The decision followed comprehensive steps undertaken by ING in Italy to strengthen its processes and management of KYC compliance risks. Following an inspection by Banca d'Italia, wh ich identified shortcomings in AML processes, ING in Italy was banned from taking on new customers in March 2019. Existing customers in Italy continued to be fully served throughout the period of the ban.\n\nKeeping banking safe and secure for the longer term, requires staying ahead in the area of financial economic crime compliance. Hence, we are building on the foundation of our global KYC enhancement programme by organising and integrating all regulatory developments and activities in the area of financial crime compliance within our regular controls framework.",

It undermines business confidence and corporate integrity, impedes fair business competition and harms international trade. It can also severely damage the reputation of companies and thus erode both public trust and investor confidence. We take these risks seriously and take steps in our organisation to identify and to minimise the risk of being involved in or associated with bribery or corruption.\n\nWe expect all ING employees at every level of the organisation to always do business in accordance with the values and behaviours of our Orange Code. We have a zero-tolerance approach when it comes to bribery and corruption. Our zero tolerance statement and more information regarding our anti-bribery and corruption (AB&C) policy can be found on our website.\n\nBribery and corruption risks are part of our non-financial risk framework, are included in the client and third-party due diligence and monitoring measures in our KYC framework and will be integrated into our systematic integrity risk analysis alongside our KYC and other integrity risks in 2021. An enhancement programme to further improve our AB&C risk assessment, controls and reporting is in progress.\n\nOur people receive training which includes how to recognise warning signs of bribery and corruption and in order to ensure they understand our zero-tolerance approach and the mandatory control measures in place. Our training framework will be enhanced to provide more targeted and specialist training on bribery and corruption risks from 2021 onwards. We encourage employees to speak up if they have concerns relating to bribery and corruption.\n\n## 5th EU AML Directive\n\nThe 5th AML Directive was implemented in the Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act (Wwft) in May 2020. Furthermore, in the battle against financial economic crime, including money laundering, the Dutch UBO-(ultimate beneficial owner) register went live in September 2020. These developments have been incorporated in ING's KYC policy framework.\n\nLooking ahead, ING keeps abreast and takes relevant action on other external developments. In this context, reference is made, among other things, to the 6th AML Directive, as well as regulatory proposals from the European Commission following from its action plan for a comprehensive union policy on preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. Moreover, the execution of the Dutch action plan for the prevention of money laundering through the Dutch financial system and for tracking and prosecuting criminals and their enablers is in progress. This action plan was presented by the Dutch Minister of Justice and Security and Minister of Finance. Anticipating regulatory developments in this area, ING and four other Dutch banks established Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL) in the collective fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. This organisation is a first of its kind: it is anticipated that within TMNL transactions of those banks are jointly monitored with advanced analytics techniques like network analytics and anomaly detection.\n\n## Common Reporting Standard (CRS)\n\nSimilarly, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has developed a Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and model competent authority agreement to enable the multilateral and automatic exchange of financial account information. CRS requires financial institutions to identify and report the tax residency and account details of non-resident customers to the relevant authorities in CRS-compliant jurisdictions. As of 29 September 2020, 109 jurisdictions ('signatory countries'), including the Netherlands, have signed a multilateral competent authority agreement to automatically exchange information pursuant to CRS. The majority of countries where ING has a presence have committed to CRS. The EU has made CRS mandatory for all its member states.\n\nThe OECD has also introduced two additional new measures to tackle global tax avoidance/evasion:\n\n- \u25aa Mandatory Disclosure Rules for Addressing CRS Avoidance Arrangements and Opaque Offshore Structures\n- \u25aa Preventing Abuse of Residence by Investment (RBI) and Citizenship by Investment (CBI) Schemes to Circumvent the CRS.\n\nThese measures are in the process of being implemented in local laws. With regard to the mandatory disclosure rules for EU jurisdictions, this was done via the amendment to Directive 2011/16 (DAC6).",

Internal monitoring, control and reporting of taxrelated risks take place on a continuous basis with regular reporting to various stakeholders. For 404/SOX purposes (section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act), an 'effectiveness of internal control statement' with respect to tax controls has been provided. Tax risk management is subject to Corporate Audit testing and evaluation. In the Netherlands and also in other countries, ING's position is to be cooperatively tax compliant, this implies to have transparency about and disclosure of relevant tax risks towards tax authorities. Tax risks not only refer to ING's own tax position, but also to the risks in relation to the tax positions of our customers. In this respect, we have integrated a tax integrity assessment in our overall customer risk assessment process.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\n## Culture and ethics\n\nA sound risk culture is paramount at ING as it determines the way in which employees identify, understand, discuss, and act on the risks we are confronted with and the risks we take. In 2020, ING conducted a self-assessment of our risk culture and are working on developing the key characteristics of ING's risk culture.\n\nTo further enhance our risk management in the area of risk culture, ING added culture and ethics risk to its compliance conduct risk scope. The proper embedding of our global Code of Conduct, Orange Code and the whistle-blower policy are key to managing our culture and ethics risk.\n\n## Orange code and the global Code of Conduct\n\nIn February 2020, ING launched a new global Code of Conduct, clarifying the link between the existing Orange Code and our main policies. The global Code of Conduct further defines the most essential conduct principles expected from ING employees in their daily activities. It provides additional risk awareness and helps to better meet expectations stated in external rules and guidelines. To enhance monitoring on the global Code of Conduct, this code will be linked (like the Orange Code) to the employees' performance management cycle to ensure a continuous attention an d dialogue on how to apply the global Code of Conduct in the daily work practice of our employees.\n\nTo preserve risk awareness in the area of risk culture, ING continued its efforts towards embedding the Orange Code decision making model (introduced in 2017) that supports ethical and well-balanced decision-making throughout ING. This included frequent training by Compliance towards the first line. In 2020 the model was also further embedded in ING's governance by adding the model to the Global Product Approval (PARP) Policy and the local PARP processes.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nCompliance will cover the risk of running deals and operations in a way where personal or organisational interests prevail over the interest of the client (e.g. when related to personal account dealing).\n\nIn 2020 our existing conflict of interest policy was revised in alignment with the standards as defined by enterprise risk management. The policy incorporates key requirements for both personal and organisational conflicts of interests in line with the EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance. Controls are defined in control standards owned by the first line of defence.\n\n## Market conduct risk\n\nMarket conduct risk is defined as running deals and operations not in line with good capital markets functioning along the product/service life cycle (i.e., pre-trade, execution and post-execution). A smooth functioning of markets and public confidence in markets are crucial for economic growth and wealth. The 2016 market abuse policy was revised to incorporate EU Regulation 2019/2115, which changed the requirements on market soundings for small and medium-sized enterprises. Furthermore, a full-fledged review of the 2016 market abuse policy was also conducted.\n\n## Treating customers fairly\n\nUnder conduct risk, ING includes the risk related to treating customers unfairly and not having their best interests in mind throughout the product life cycle (from design to advice and claims handling).",

        "page_content": "- > Model risk\n\n## Model risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nModel risk is the risk that the financial or reputational position of ING is negatively impacted as a consequence of the use of models. Model risk can arise from errors in the development, implementation, use or interpretation of models, or from incomplete or wrong data etc., leading to inaccurate, noncompliant or misinterpreted model outputs.\n\n## A model is defined as:\n\na quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates or whose inputs are partially or wholly qualitative or based on expert judgement.\n\nA tool or solution (a candidate model) is considered a model when:\n\n- \u25aa it covers quantitative approaches whose inputs are partially or wholly qualitative or based on expert judgement, provided that the output is quantitative in nature;\n- \u25aa it is used multiple times without changing or reconsidering the assumptions, model parameters or weighting factors; and\n- \u25aa the outcome is used for decision-making.\n\n## Covid-19 impact\n\nThe outcome of models depends directly on the data that is used as input. As described throughout this report many sectors have been hit hard by the consequences of the pandemic and governments have taken extraordinary support measures to counteract the negative economic circumstances these sectors are experiencing. The same measures also cloud to a certain extent the reliability of the data that currently is being used as input for models. The support measures interfere with normal economic circumstances meaning that data currently used may not reflect the true nature of economic circumstances and may be positively biased. The increased model risk that is associated with this phenomenon has been acknowledged and is being managed by a range of management actions, such as management overlays, and close monitoring of portfolio developments.\n\n## Models governance (*)\n\nThe growing complexity and number of models created and utilised every year for decision-making makes it important to manage and control the associated model risk accordingly. Within ING the overarching responsibility for this risk type lies within Model Risk Management (MoRM) department. The MoRM, is responsible for identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting global model risk exposure at the aggregated level. The department sets and maintains a model risk management framework containing: (1) model governance, (2) model risk appetite, (3) model risk management policies and standards, and (4) the global model inventory tool. MoRM is responsible for providing independent validation of models in use within ING. For that purpose, the department has four specialised dedicated teams, each focusing on different family of models, namely: Credit Risk Model Validation, Banking Book Risk Model Validation, Trading Book Risk Model Validation and Data Science Model Validation.\n\nThe Model Risk Management Committee (MoRMC) is in place to align the overall model strategy and approve the model risk appetite, model risk management policies and methodologies. MoRMC is mandated by the MBB and chaired by the CRO of ING, the MoRMC meets monthly.\n\n## Model lines of defence (*)\n\nING's model risk and control s tructure is based on the three model lines of defence (MLoD) approach. This approach aims to provide a sound governance framework for model risk management by defining and implementing three different management layers with distinct roles and oversight responsibilities.",

In that case, both domains (risk or audit service) become 1 st MLOD.\n\n## Model Risk Appetite (Model RAS) (*)\n\nThe model risk appetite is designed to determine the level of model risk ING is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives. The initial iteration of Model RAS was introduced in 2020 and it will be monitored and evaluated in 2021.\n\n## Model risk management (*)\n\nSince models are by definition simplifications of reality, model risk is inherent in the use of models and therefore model risk must be identified and managed. Model risk management includes the identification, assessment, control (acceptance or mitigation) and monitoring (and reporting) of the risks related to applying models in various business processes.\n\nModel risk management is to be executed for each individual model through the model life cycle via processes such as: model classification, model risk identification and assessment, and model validation. On an aggregated level model risk is monitored via analysis of data from the global model inventory. The insights, from aggregated data analysis, are reported to the MoRMC and to the MBB for senior management to take well-informed decisions on acceptance or further mitigation of model risk.\n\n## Model lines of defence (*)\n\nBank wide model risk management framework with, amongst others, governance, policies RAS, inventory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndependent auditors\n\nCorporate audit services",

The objectives of the different processes are outlined below (reference).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInitiation or change : The initiation of the development of a new model or change of an existing model can be triggered by different factors. These may be (i) internal, such as the introduction of a new product that cannot be handled by the existing models, a change in ING's organisation, financial or commercial strategy or findings and issues by an auditor, validator or based on monitoring; or (ii) external, such as innovation/new technology that becomes available (for example the Fintech models), new or upcoming supervisory regulations or ongoing technical developments.\n\nData collection is the process of defining and collecting data that meets the defined data quality requirements for model development. The process includes the definition of the data needed, assessment of data availability and quality, assumptions and limitations, as well as the gathering of the data needed for the analyses, impact study and testing during the model development process.\n\nModel development is a structured process that leads to a model that is ready for validation and subsequent use. Depending on the development approach these first stages can be separate or integrated. An example of the latter is data science based application development.\n\nPre-approval validation is the independent confirmation that the model is valid for its intended use, before the new or changed model is submitted for use approval. To ensure objectivity and effective challenge, the model validator is independent from other model parties such as the model developer, model owner or model approver. Model validation applies equally to in-house developed and thirdparty models.\n\nThe objective of the model approval stage is approval for use. The model owner submits the model for formal consent by the internal approver before being deployed and used. The recommendations and validation report prepared by the model validator are key inputs for approval for use.\n\nDuring the implementation stage, the model is realised, tested and made available in a production environment.\n\nIn the model use stage the model is applied by the users for the specific purpose it was designed for. The model can only be used after formal validation and approval for use of the model.",

Model performance monitoring begins when model use has started and continues until the model has officially been decommissioned.\n\nPeriodic validation: During the life time of a model its ongoing validity must be safeguarded. This is done by periodical independent (re)validation that assesses whether the model is still valid for its intended use. There are two types of validation: (1) periodic, such as annual, which is mandatory for regulatory models, or (2) ad hoc, for example triggered by changes in the model, the business or financial instruments etc. The actual frequency of periodic validation depends on the model risk, model type and applicable regulation.\n\nA model that is / will no longer be used must be decommissioned. Decommissioning disables the model. It can, for example, be triggered because (1) the product, organisation or risk the model is made for has changed considerably or no longer exists, (2) the model is outdated, underperforming or better alternatives are available, (3) the model became obsolete due to standardisation or (4) the external approver withdraws its approval for the model.\n\nContinuous model inventory and reporting : Keeping an inventory of all models and their status during their lifecycle is a continuous process. It supports management and control of the models in scope, both per individual model and the overarching management of all ING's models. Periodic model risk reporting provides the relevant internal and external stakeholders with an overview of the models in use and the associated model risk given the defined model risk appetite.",

It is the risk inherent to strategy decisions, internal efficiency and the business environment. Business risk capital is calculated via the variance-covariance methodology for these risks, covering the risk that volume/margins, net fee and commission income and operating expenses will deviate from the expected expenses over the horizon of the relevant activities.\n\n## Governance and risk management\n\nING applies an explicit risk appetite statement regarding business risk, focusing on earnings stability and diversification of the business mix. Avoiding putting all eggs in one basket reduces the risk that volumes and/or margins will suddenly drop due to unexpected changes in the business environment for certain markets and products. Furthermore, the underlying risk types (expense risk, volume-margin risk, and net fee and commission income risk) are mitigated and managed differently. Expense risk is monitored and managed via the financial performance of the bank and the local units, whereby the reported expense numbers are compared on a quarterly basis with the projected cost/income ratio. Deviations from this ambition are monitored as part of the financial projections that are discussed continuously within different parts of the organisation.",

In this interview, Hans Wijers, chairman of the Supervisory Board, looks back on the year.\n\n## Is there one word or phrase that describes this year for you?\n\nIt was an exceptional year and incredibly demanding. It tested our flexibility to adapt and deal with change. For ING, as for everyone, 2020 was dominated by the impact of Covid-19, and by the changes in the leadership of our company.\n\n## How do you look back on 2020?\n\nAn absolute highlight was how quickly ING adapted to the new situation and how our employees continued to work in often challenging circumstances. Within a very short time around 80 percent of employees worldwide had switched to working from home, from where they are continuing to serve our customers, are further digitalising the bank and improving anti-money laundering processes.\n\nThis also once again underlines that ING has the right ambition and strategy to become a leading datadriven digital bank. Without the many investments in ING's transformation we would not have been able to move as quickly and as effectively as we did. We' re really proud of this achievement. We couldn't have done this without the dedication of our people.

        "page_content": "- > In conversation with our chairman\n\n## What were the main focus areas of the Supervisory Board?\n\nThe topic that stood out for us this year was how ING could help customers, employees and communities safely through the Covid-19 pandemic, while taking into account our business continuity, performance and our gatekeeper role to ensure the bank's continued security and compliance. For instance, ING participated in government-sponsored initiatives offering payment holidays to help people and manage the impact of the pandemic. As the Supervisory Board, we were also impressed by local ING initiatives to support their communities, for example by donating materials or raising funds with customers and colleagues.\n\nThe spread of Covid-19 has made the Think Forward strategy more relevant than ever. Through the transformation into a leading data-driven digital bank, ING is continuing to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business -also in a time of social and economic disruption. As the Supervisory Board, it's our task to oversee and constructively challenge the Executive Board in its ambition to transform into a leading data-driven digital bank, in line with the strategy. We guide and support the Executive Board in this and together we discuss strategic, operational and risk topics. Having this open dialogue is very important to the relationship between our boards. Due to the coronavirus restrictions, we could not meet in person with the full Supervisory Board, but we succeeded in keeping the dialogue going in our virtual meetings.\n\nThroughout 2020 we monitored and discussed the progress of the strategy and the associated transformation programmes. It became evident during the year that the challenging external environment required ING to place increased focus on 'how' and 'where' we put the strategy into practice. The increased focus on executing the strategic priorities with more certainty led to changes in the geographical and client footprint of our Wholesale Banking business and the decision to stop the Maggie transformation programme.\n\nAnd while we needed to deal with the immediate challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, we continued with our sustainability efforts, as we want to play our part in building back a better world. You can find many examples in this report.\n\nING's risk culture and the priority to further strengthen our global anti -money laundering and know your customer activities were also key attention areas. Managing non-financial risk is as important as managing financial risk and we continued to work hard to deliver on our commitment to ensure ING is a safe, secure and compliant bank. This includes through the global KYC enhancement programme, which comprises structural improvements in compliance policies, tooling, monitoring governance, knowledge and behaviour. In December 2020, the Court of Appeal in The Hague upheld the Dutch prosecutor's decision to enter into a settlement agreement with ING in September 2018 , relating to shortcomings in the execution of policies to prevent financial economic crime at ING Netherlands. We welcome the ruling but regret the decision to order the prosecution of our former CEO, which goes against the assessment of the public prosecutors that their investigations found no grounds for a case against ING employees or former employees.\n\nAnother important topic was IN G's new capital plan and dividend policy. We aim to offer a sustainable and attractive return to shareholders and have introduced a 50 percent pay-out ratio of resilient net profit, in the form of cash, or a combination of cash and share repurchases, with the majority in cash. In addition, we'll periodically review whether there is structural excess capital available to return to shareholders. In executing the new distribution policy, ING will comply with the prevailing recommendation of the European Central Bank on shareholder distributions.\n\n## In February, Ralph Hamers announced his decision leave ING. There were also other changes in the Executive Board and Supervisory Board to address?\n\nThese changes and the related selection processes were certainly high on our agenda in 2020.\n\nAfter a successful, career-long tenure at ING, Ralph Hamers announced that he would step down as chief executive officer on 30 June 2020. Ralph was the architect of ING's digital stra tegy and we are very grateful for his inspiration and leadership over the past seven years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was pleased to appoint chief risk officer Steven van Rijswijk as CEO following a broad and rigorous selection process. With almost 25 years at ING, of which three on the Executive Board, we concluded that Steven has the right combination of experience, leadership skills and deep understanding of ING's business to lead us through the next phase of our strategic direction. It was a smooth transition, thanks to the efforts of both Ralph and Steven.",

In the interim, the day -to-day risk management activities were performed by Karst Jan Wolters, reporting to chief financial officer Tanate Phutrakul. The Supervisory Board is grateful to all involved for the seamless transition in such a complex environment.\n\nIn addition, Isabel Fernandez, responsible for Wholesale Banking in the Management Board Banking, left on 31 December to continue her career outside of ING. We appreciate her high-energy leadership over the past four years. The Supervisory Board is actively looking to appoint her successor.\n\nFinding suitable candidates for ING's Executive Boar d and Management Board Banking remains challenging, as there are numerous requirements to take into account, including diversity to enhance the composition of the Boards, as well as specific criteria for each function, including regulatory requirements. In terms of the dimensions of diversity, Ljiljana \u010cortan will add both nationality and gender diversity to the Executive Board and Management Board in line with our 70 percent principle. You can read more about our diversity policy in this Annual Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is convinced that with its new, diverse composition of the executive top team, ING is well-positioned to face the external challenges and drive the required changes to implement our digital banking strategy.\n\nWe also experienced several changes to the Supervisory Board itself in 2020. Harold Naus, Herman Hulst and Juan Colomb\u00e1s have succeeded Robert Reibestein, Hermann-Josef Lamberti and Eric Boyer de la Giroday. Robert, Hermann-Josef and Eric have served ING for many years in a very professional, committed way.

We are convinced that Harold, Herman and Juan will prove to be worthy successors.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement is important for you and the Supervisory Board. How did you engage with ING's various stakeholders during the pandemic?\n\nStakeholder engagement is important for obtaining broad acceptance among our stakeholders with regards to decisions on important topics. We aim to maintain continuous interaction with supervisors, customers, shareholders, employees, NGOs and other stakeholders. We continued to do so in 2020, albeit taking into account the challenges in this respect due to the Covid-19 restrictions, which limited our direct interaction.\n\nAn example of our efforts to engage with stakeholders is on the new 2020 remuneration policies for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, which helped to secure shareholder approval of 94 percent and 98 percent respectively at the AGM in 2020. Other examples of stakeholder engagement, which mainly took place through indirect and virtual channels, are ING's capital plan and new distribution policy.\n\n## What is the impact of Covid19 on ING's results ?\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 on the communities and customers that we serve is immense. However, because of the many uncertainties about the availability of vaccines, the speed of vaccination, the emergence of new strains of the virus and the various government support programmes, it remains difficult to assess the full impact of the crisis on our business. As such, a conservative approach is merited and this is reflected in our 2020 numbers, as well as in the decisions we've taken on capital distribution and remuneration.\n\nA deep economic recession in 2020 was avoided through extensive fiscal government programmes and large monetary impulses by the European Central Bank. Governments will have to continue to support their economies in 2021 to face the crisis and to recover from it.",

        "page_content": "- > In conversation with our chairman\n\nAltogether, in view of the very difficult circumstances, 2020 was a tough year but our financial results remained resilient. There was a continued healthy demand for mortgages, although as people spent less during lockdown, we saw an increase in savings and a decline in demand for business and consumer loans. Fee and commission income grew in 2020 as considerably more customers chose ING as their bank for investment products. Risk costs, while significantly higher for the full year, dropped in the second half compared with the high provisioning in the first half of 2020, while operating expenses remained under control. ING's CET1 ratio strengthened further to 15.5 percent. We also continued to see more customers choose ING, with primary customers growing by 578,000 over 2020.\n\n## What are the most important priorities for the Supervisory Board in the coming years?\n\nThe Covid19 crisis, ING's strategic priorities, the various succession processes, and other topics on the Supervisory Board agenda have all significantly increased the time commitment of our members. I'm happy to say the Supervisory Board has shown a lot of positive energy and dedication to help steer the company through these choppy waters.\n\nWithout a doubt, 2021 will be another challenging year. There are many uncertainties and headwinds: macroeconomic developments, the development of Covid-19, regulatory changes, the negative interest environment, climate change and cybercrime. We don't know what the future holds or how it will affect ING. But the Supervisory Board is convinced that we have the right digital, customer-focused strategy, a lot of opportunities to create more focus on delivering on our strategy and reducing our costs. And first and foremost, as 2020 has shown, we have more than 57,000 dedicated employees and a great leadership team to steer ING successfully towards new successes.\n\nOn behalf of my colleagues in the Supervisory Board I would like to express our appreciation for what the company has achieved, as well as thank our stakeholders for their contributions and, of course, thank all ING employees worldwide for their hard work and commitment in 2020.",

        "page_content": "- > Supervisory Board report\n\n## Supervisory Board report\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board and its committees continued to focus on overseeing and constructively challenging management in their ambition to keep transforming into a leading data-driven digital bank in line with the Think Forward strategy. Another important focus was how ING could help customers, employees and communities safely through the Covid19 pandemic. ING's risk culture and the priority to further strengthen its global anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) activities remained key attention areas.\n\nThe Supervisory Board met 10 times in 2020 for its regular meetings. On average, 98 percent of the Supervisory Board members were present at the meetings. This attendance rate is slightly higher compared to previous years. In addition, many extra meetings have been held in view of addressing the Covid-19 pandemic. See the attendance matrix for the Supervisory Board meetings and committee meetings for more details. The continued high attendance in 2020 demonstrates that Supervisory Board members are continuously engaged with ING and are able to devote sufficient time and attention to overseeing ING's affairs. Since 2018, the Supervisory Board discusses and reconfirms all of its members' outside positions on an annual basis and approves any intended outside positions when they occur, among others to safeguard this level of engagement.\n\nThe Executive Board and Management Board Banking were present at each regular Supervisory Board meeting. For some parts of these meetings, depending on the nature of the topics discussed, only the chief executive officer was present. The Supervisory Board also had sessions with only its individual members, prior to its regular meetings when this was justified by the nature of the topics on the agenda. The purpose of these so-called pre-meetings and Supervisory Board-only meetings is to allow the Supervisory Board to reflect independently on and consider important matters in the absence of the Executive Board and Management Board Banking. The Supervisory Board aims to strike a balance\n\nbetween the interests of all stakeholders while maintaining an open dialogue with ING's internal organisation and external supervisors.\n\nIn addition to the topics mentioned in the introduction, the Supervisory Board also focused on the progress and delivery of ING's various transformation initiatives and how these relate to external developments in areas such as the regulatory domain. This is to ensure the right priorities continue to be set, with the appropriate allocation of resources. It became evident during the year that the challenging external environment requires ING to focus with increased rigour on 'how' and 'where' to deliver the Think Forward strategy. The strategic dialogues held in 2020 between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board and Management Board Banking concluded that activities should be refocused to ensure the bank is making customer journeys simpler, faster and seamless and there is a continuously improving end-to-end digital customer experience.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also discussed the succession planning of the Executive Board and the Management Board Banking -i.e. for the chief executive officer, chief risk officer and the head of Wholesale Banking (WB) -the impact of Covid-19 as has been detailed throughout this report, the impact of the continued negative interest rate environment on ING's performance and its stakeholders, sustainability from a strategic perspective, the outcome of and follow-up to the European Central Bank's (ECB) Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), the results of and learnings from the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model (VRAM), ING's financial risk, non -financial risk and compliance risks, the transformation programme of the compliance function resulting in the new integrated endtoend coverage and responsibility per compliance risk area, ING's gatekeeper role and ensuring the security and compliance of the bank through enhancing and maturing ING's know your customer (KYC) priorities supported by structural solutions, the strong focu s on further strengthening ING's risk culture , the implementation of SRD II and several topical regulatory themes with a global ING scope such as ICAAP, data (including strategy, management, quality, data ingestion and ethics), IT, sourcing, the suitability requirements for boards and key function holders and the global implementation thereof.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board discussed the financing of the company in accordance with our capital and liquidity adequacy in line with our annually updated Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), business continuity in light of the pandemic, ING's capital plan and ING's dividend distribution policy and ongoing supervisory developments. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed the Management",

The Management Board Banking and Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular updates. Their discussions focused on how ING could help customers, employees and communities safely through the Covid-19 pandemic, while taking into account ING's business continuity, performance and its gatekeeper role to ensure the bank's continued security and compliance. In addition to discussions that took place during the meetings, the Management Board Banking and Executive Board provided interim written updates on the topic to the Supervisory Board. Outside of the collective meetings there was also frequent interaction between the chairs of the relevant Supervisory Board committees and the members of the Executive Board to ensure that everyone was up-to-date on the most recent developments at all times.\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2020\n\nIn consultation with and as approved by the Supervisory Board, ING also changed a number of aspects of the 2020 Annual General Meeting as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. For details on this meeting and its organisation, read more in the Corporate Governance chapter.\n\n## Continuous dialogue with stakeholders\n\nING aims to maintain continuous interaction with customers, shareholders, employees, society and other stakeholders. In general, the Supervisory Board has had periodic conversations with various internal and external stakeholders and it exercised its oversight role to ensure that necessary actions resulting from this cascaded down into the organisation and were followed up, including those actions related to risk culture and behaviour. Some 2020 examples in this respect relate to stakeholder interaction with regard to the new remuneration policies for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and ING's capital plan and distribution policy . The dialogue between ING and external supervisors was a standard agenda item for the Supervisory Board throughout the year. This included several discussions on the results of and follow-up to the annual SREP through which the ECB aims to promote",

The SREP involves a comprehensive assessment of banks' strategies, processes and risks, and takes a forward-looking view to determine how much capital each bank needs to cover its risks. Also, the topic of pri mary customer development and managing ING's reputation and brand was dealt with during the Supervisory Board's deliberations.\n\n## Strengthening ING's global AML/KYC priorities\n\nKeeping ING safe, secure and compliant continues to be a top priority. Various initiatives have been launched to further enhance AML/KYC throughout the bank. Since November 2017, ING has been working to strengthen customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and screening and has become sustainably better in fighting financial economic crime through the global KYC enhancement programme. Among other things, this has led to standardised KYC policies, global KYC governance, consistent processes, tooling and training. Further developments are captured in the Financial Economic Crime (FEC) Control Maturity Programme, which defines ING's operational long -term FEC control framework to manage and mitigate financial and economic crime risks in a sustainable, riskbased way. The progress is being monitored by and discussed between the Supervisory Board, management and the relevant supervisors.\n\nAs part of the aforementioned efforts in view of KYC/AML and also part of the Supervisory Board's programme of lifelong learning, the Supervisory Board participated in various sessions ranging from overarching deep dives and thematic sessions to business visits. With regard to the latter, before the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Supervisory Board among others visited ING 's local and centralised compliance/KYC operations in France and in the Netherlands. During these visits a dialogue took place with the teams involved, contributing to a better mutual understanding of the importance of the various initiatives and processes, the results of which led into subsequent discussions on the topic at group level.\n\nThe Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Management Board Banking also discussed ING's global AML/KYC governance and processes. Additional improvements were identified that are now being implemented. The boards reconfirmed their commitment to ensure ING continues to fulfil its gatekeeper role, complies with applicable regulatory requirements and continues taking the necessary actions to strengthen compliance risk management and culture throughout the organisation.\n\n## Permanent education and business visits\n\nPermanent education including business visits is important for the members of the Supervisory Board as part of their continuous learning, aimed at maintaining their ING-related knowledge and expertise and expanding these where necessary. Educational activities help to keep the Supervisory Board up-todate with and gain in-depth insight into the global and local economic, financial and political landscape and increase its un derstanding of and engagement with ING's business operations and stakeholders.\n\nThe annual Supervisory Board Knowledge Days, which took place in Amsterdam on 16 and 17 January 2020, were combined with regular Supervisory Board meetings and focused on the compliance maturity plan, AML/KYC, WB strategy update, Organisational Health Index and governance related matters (including the evolving role of the boards, suitability and risk culture).\n\nThe destinations for the Supervisory Board/Executive Board/Management Board Banking annual business visits in 2020 would have been Australia (Sydney) and the Philippines (Manilla) in order to gain a better understanding of local business challenges, with specific focus on AML/KYC and data security, as well as on sourcing, including the role of ING's shared service centres. Due to the global Covid -19 outbreak and measures imposed to prevent the spread, e.g. travel restrictions and social distancing, the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board and the Management Board Banking decided to postpone the physical business visits until further notice.\n\nThroughout the year, a number of other educational sessions on specific topics were organised for and at the request of the Supervisory Board. For 2020 a balance was sought between sessions focused on Compliance/KYC and other relevant topics, the latter including among others technology and IT platforms, sourcing, open banking, managing capital and liquidity risk with Covid-19, credit decision models and managing and developing talent. Additionally, at the request of the Supervisory Board, several deep dive sessions were organised on selected recurring key topics, such as KYC, IT and cyber",

These sessions had a substantial risk management relevance and contributed to a more in-depth understanding of the matters discussed.\n\nThematic sessions were organised to focus specifically on certain themes that needed further attention and/or were looking forward at emerging risks and developments. For 2020 these related to the SREP interim status update, data plan and quality, ECAP/ICAAP including stress testing and economic capital, Quality Assurance and residual risk in file enhancement (regarding KYC), paymentrelated initiatives and challenges, and sustainability (energy transition and climate change).\n\nThese visits and educational sessions provided ample opportunities for Supervisory Board members to interact with senior management and employees on location. Imposed Covid-19 measures have precluded dedicated speed-meet sessions since March 2020. The Supervisory Board will continue this practice in 2021 if the situation allows. Such interaction contributes to a better mutual understanding and alignment on what matters most to ING, both for its employees and for the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Strategy based on long-term value creation\n\nIn late 2016, ING announced the acceleration of the implementation of the Think Forward strategy, focusing on investing in the bank's digital transformation and creating a scalable banking platform. Several global transformation programmes were approved to accelerate the strategy.\n\nING's strategy, together with the transformation programmes, execute s multiple initiatives to further improve ING's differentiating customer experience, earn primary customers, develop analytical skills to understand ING's customers better, increase the pace of innovation to serve changing customer needs, enhance efficiency, and think beyond traditional banking to develop new services and business models while growing our lending capabilities. Throughout 2020, the Supervisory Board monitored and discussed the progress of the strategy and its transformation and, as part of this, had an active dialogue with the Executive Board and the Management Board Banking. The spread of Covid-19 has made the Think Forward strategy more relevant than ever. Through ING's transformation into a dynamic digital player, ING is continuing to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business -also in a time of social and economic disruption. With the Terra approach ING is further\n\ntrying to positively influence society by steering ING's lending portfolio to align with the well -below two degrees goal of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nDriving and delivering commercial momentum in a sustainable, safe and compliant way remains, among others, dependent on how ING allocates capital and resources, manages the transformation and manages (non-financial) risk. This is discussed at periodic meetings between the Supervisory Board and management. The Supervisory Board acknowledges it is important to take into account the duty of care towards those stakeholders of the bank who may be impacted by ING's transition throughout the transformation.\n\nFrom the dialogue with management, it became evident that the challenging external environment requires ING to focus with increased rigour on 'how' and 'where' to deliver the Think Forward strategy. The boards therefore concluded that refocusing activities should ensure faster delivery of products and services and a continuously improving end-to-end digital customer experience. In further developing ING's digital universal bank, ING will focus efforts on three things: the global use of ING's technology foundation -which includes shared data lakes, cloud and modular IT building blocks; the reuse where possible of already developed mobile app components; and the rollout of global digital product offerings in the areas of insurance, investments and consumer lending. All this will be done in accordance with, and while continuing to progress delivery on, ING's regulatory programmes; in line with our top priority to remain a safe, secure and compliant bank that places integrity above all else.\n\n## Financial and risk reporting\n\nThe Executive Board prepared the financial statements and discussed these with the Supervisory Board, including the SOX 404 Report in relation to the Annual Report on Form 20F. ING's Annual Report is presented in an integrated form for the sixth successive year. The financial statements will be submitted for adoption at the 2021 Annual General Meeting as part of the 2020 Annual Report.\n\nIn 2020, the quarterly results, including the relevant auditor reports and press releases, were discussed and approved in the months February, May, August and November. The full-year 2019 financial results were discussed and approved in March 2020. In consultation with the Supervisory Board important decisions were made in 2020 with regard to ING's long -term CET1 ratio ambition level and",

In addition, elements relevant to the draft agenda for the Annual General Meeting were discussed and decided on.\n\nThe Supervisory Board approved the annual review of the Reward and Appointment Framework that reflects recent changes in regulatory requirements. Per standard practice, the Supervisory Board was informed in detail throughout the year of the potential financial and non-financial risks for ING, including the implications of Covid-19, subsequent political and economic developments in various countries and regions, updates on (upcoming) regulatory changes, and discussed how these could best be mitigated. As part of this ING undertook additional stress testing and the results were discussed with the Supervisory Board.\n\nKPMG, in its role as ING's external auditor, audited ING's 2020 financial statements. As part of the standard procedures, KPMG declared itself independent from ING, in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Based on the Audit Committee proposal, the Supervisory Board supported the audit plans of the internal and external auditor including a subsequent update due to Covid-19 impact, the latter including the updated scope and materiality of the external audit.\n\n## Internal Supervisory Board meetings\n\nDuring the internal meetings of the Supervisory Board in 2020 (with the chief executive officer in attendance, except when matters concerning the chief executive officer were discussed), among others, the Executive Board and Management Board Banking annual targets and periodic performance assessments were reviewed and approved. Other recurring topics of discussion at these internal meetings were the future composition of the Executive Board (including the succession of the chief executive officer and chief risk officer), the Management Board Banking (including the succession of the head of WB ) and the Supervisory Board (including its committee composition). ING's broader talent and succession planning were also discussed in view of bench strength, including the outcome of ING's annual Talent review. Other specific topics dealt with in 2020 concerned the approval and global implementation of ING's suitability policy framework and the proposed new remuneration policies for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board.\n\nFurthermore, as in previous years, the Supervisory Board conducted its annual self-evaluation over the reporting year, facilitated by an independent external party and with input from several executives\n\nand senior managers who regularly interact with the Supervisory Board and attend Supervisory Board meetings. The self-assessment specifically addressed the 'what' (roles and responsibilities) and the 'how' (culture and behaviour).\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board self-evaluation was on the agenda multiple times. The topic was on the agenda at the start of the year to discuss the outcome over the previous year and to agree the positive points to keep and the points for further improvement. With regard to the latter, priorities and action points had been defined for follow-up during the year. The agreed 2020 priorities of the Supervisory Board included:\n\n- \u00b7 an increased focus on ING's longer -term strategic ambition and the external/competitive landscape, with AML/compliance/regulatory matters as an integral part of this and increased execution focus;\n- \u00b7 further strengthening the boards' succession pipelines and the depth and diversity of bench strength, that at least safeguards adequate knowledge and experience of potential suitable candidates in banking, operations/digital and regulation;\n- \u00b7 continuation of building and maintaining trust with all stakeholders, including a thorough understanding of their needs and what drives them;\n- \u00b7 expanding on professional challenge and advice towards the organisation to enable more clearly set expectations on prioritisation and milestones.\n\nDuring a mid-year evaluation, the Supervisory Board reviewed progress on the action points. From this it was concluded that ample progress had been made in respect of all priorities. In the second half of the year the Supervisory Board, together with the Executive Board and Management Board Banking agreed to apply and follow the same approach, process and design over 2020, including continued alignment between the respective boards.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's overall reflection is that it underwent significant change over the past period, with a positive impact on its performance in general, despite the many uncertainties and challenges for ING and its stakeholders caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Supervisory Board is of the opinion it gave the pandemic appropriate attention immediately, and that it was effective in doing so by adjusting its focus and priorities. As more generic positive points it identified with respect to its performance are, among others, the following: (1) The recent changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board contributed to improved balance, with a more diversified spread in background,",

Judgemental accounting topics were also regular topics of discussion as well as key audit matters, as included in the auditors' reports .\n\nIn addition to financial results and accounts, the Audit Committee's regular deliberations included financial re porting, the external auditor's audit plan/engagement letter/independence and fees, the\n\noverall internal control environment, the internal controls over financial reporting, the internal and external auditor reports, review of the internal audit function, and matters related to the financing of the company, including the assessment of ING's capital and liquidity position. The Audit Committee also reviewed the press releases related to the periodic results, the Annual Report, the 6-K and 20-F forms and the SOX 404 Report, and discussed and made recommendations for the approval of the internal and external audit plans.\n\nSpecific attention was paid to a variety of other related topics. These included ING's long -term CET1 ratio ambition level which the Audit Committee advised could be adjusted downward, to be around 12.5%. This translates into a ~200 bps buffer over current minimum regulatory requirements. ING intends to manage CET1 level well above this ambition level, while Covid-19-related uncertainties remain. ING's distribution policy was another important topic. ING is introducing a new distribution policy of a 50 percent pay-out ratio of resilient net profit, in the form of cash or a combination of cash and share repurchases, to offer a sustainable and attractive return, with periodic reviews of whether there is structural excess capital available to return to shareholders. In execution of the new dividend policy, ING will comply with prevailing ECB recommendations on shareholder distributions.\n\nOther topics were generic IFRS-related developments and their potential impact on ING's disclosures, also in light of Covid-19, and legal proceedings. High priority and critical overdue issues, as reported by the internal audit function, were also discussed. The updated internal audit charter and the quarterly whistleblower report were also areas of attention. The Audit Committee performed a thorough assessment of the functioning of the external auditor and the scope and materiality of the audit plan and the principal risks identified in the audit plan. All relevant items discussed by the Audit Committee were reported to the Supervisory Board, with the Supervisory Board approving those items as required from a governance perspective.\n\nDirectly following the Audit Committee meetings, the members of the Audit Committee met in a closed meeting with the internal and external auditors to seek confirmation that -among others -all relevant topics were discussed in the Audit Committee meetings.\n\nTo properly prepare for the regular Audit Committee meetings, the chairperson of the Audit Committee held separate sessions with the external auditor, the general manager of the internal audit",

The chairperson also met with various senior managers.\n\n## Risk Committee meetings\n\nSimilar as for the other committees, all relevant items discussed by the Risk Committee were reported to the Supervisory Board, with the Supervisory Board approving those items as required from a governance perspective. While transforming its organisation, ING needs to ensure that integrity continues to come first and that critical non-financial risk areas stay top of mind, because this is an integral part of who ING is. ING needs to build strong foundations with structural solutions that continue to earn and maintain the trust of our stakeholders, including its customers and society at large. Given the ever increasing importance of risk and how this is managed and supervised, the Risk Committee composition was expanded in 2020 to comprise almost all Supervisory Board members. In 2020, the number and length of periodic Risk Committee meetings was further increased: there are now 10 regular meetings per year, of which three are combined with the Remuneration Committee to address remuneration-related risk elements. In light of Covid-19, additional updates on financial, nonfinancial and compliance risk were provided.\n\nIn each quarterly Risk Committee meeting financial and model risks, non-financial and compliance risks were discussed, including the status of ING's accompanying metrics such as for risks in the areas of solvency, liquidity and funding, credit, country, market, IT, non-financial risk and compliance. The non-financial and compliance risk discussions were supported by updates of the bank-wide KYC enhancement and maturity efforts, a variety of topical dashboards (such as on KYC GDPR/GDPP, PSD2, MiFID II, risk culture, sourcing and data quality) and the status of implementation of related regulatory programmes.\n\nIn addition, throughout the year, a number of deep dives and thematic sessions took place on specific topics such as compliance/KYC, including risk culture, IT and cybersecurity; modelling; SREP; ECAP/ICAAP; stress testing; CVA hedging and the impact on capital MiFID II; sourcing; data; payment initiatives, and the energy transition and climate change. These sessions were in principal presented from a risk management angle and where relevant also addressed the impact of the pandemic. Members of the Supervisory Board that are not Risk Committee members received a standing invitation and they participated in several of these sessions.\n\nIn 2020, and as part of its annual work plan, the Risk Committee also discussed the annual review of the RAF and accompanying risk appetite statements, the update to the Recovery Plan, as well as the impact of upcoming regulations, and credit developments in certain countries and portfolios. Also on the agenda were the updates to the scope of ING's key policies, the KYC policy, the global Code of Conduct, the Compliance charter, the Investor Protection and Markets policy, and the implementation of the Conflicts of Interest policy.\n\nDuring 2020, the Risk Committee also discussed the potential financial, non-financial and compliance risk implications of the Covid-19 outbreak. The discussions were supported by the different analyses conducted on the potential impact on ING's credit port folio, capital and liquidity position and updates on credit developments in certain countries and portfolios. The non-financial and compliance risk discussions around Covid-19 included, among others, risks related to business continuity, business resilience, the working from home control environment, HR, IT, cybercrime and KYC.\n\nThe Risk Committee's feedback was also brought to bear on discussions regarding remunerationrelated matters and practices. Among others, it considers remuneration related proposals from a risk perspective in view of the remuneration policies for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model introduced in 2018 (see also ' Remuneration Committee meetings ' in this section).\n\nRead more in the Risk Management section.\n\n## Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee meetings\n\nIt is ING's aim to ensure that all of its boards' are at all times adequately composed to perform its duties. As is standard practice the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee therefore discussed medium- to long-term succession planning for the Executive Board, the Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board.\n\nWith regard to the Executive Board, specific attention was paid in 2020 to the succession of the chief executive officer and the chief risk officer and for the Management Board Banking this was the case for the head of WB. With regard to the Supervisory Board, the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee continued its search for potential suitable successors so as to maintain a balanced",

Finding suitable board succession candidates remains challenging, as numerous requirements must be met in view of board composition, including regulatory requirements, suitability considerations, diversity, banking and other industry knowledge, outside positions, independence, no conflicts of interest, availability, etc. Diversityrelated aspects that are being taken into account include the minimum and optimal size of a board and how to arrive at an appropriate balance in its representation of regions, age, gender, and knowledge and expertise. Read more on the boards' composition in the Composition of the Executive Board, Management Board Banking and Supervisory Board section that also includes a diversity and competence matrix.\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee focuses on ING's broader talent and succession planning in view of bench strength and improving diversity at the higher management levels -taking into account ING's diversity policy (70 percent principle for mixed teams) as published on ing.com -and accelerating refreshment where possible without jeopardising business continuity. A continuing conversation on Executive Board and Management Board Banking succession planning is facilitated by the chief human resources officer as part of its regular meetings in the form of deep dives by function and business line. The committee also holds periodic conversations outside of its regular meetings with internal talented individuals who are considered to have the potential to assume more senior and complex roles in the organisation over time. The results of these conversations are fed into the individuals' coac hing and development plans.\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, the committee discussed the 2020 Annual Report and the accompanying booklets on ING's application of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Dutch Banking Code. It also discussed the approach and agenda for the 2020 Annual General Meeting, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the year, the committee discussed the suitability policy framework and its global implementation, which embeds clear criteria and a process for assessing and re-assessing governing bodies and key function holders by bringing together several existing policies and procedures. Standard topics on the committee's agenda included board members' outside positions and the annual review and update of the corporate board charters, the latter which were re-written in 2020 with a new design for simplicity, transparency and consistency purposes. The charters were complemented with separate role descriptions.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the Supervisory Board, with the Supervisory Board approving those items as required from a governance perspective.\n\n## Remuneration Committee meetings\n\nAs an annual recurring topic, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policies and procedures of the Executive Board and the Management Board Banking. In 2020, the committee played a key role in finalising the new remuneration policies of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, taking into account stakeholder consultation feedback. The proposed policies were input for the 2020 Annual General Meeting, resulting in the general meeting approving said policies. For further details, see the Remuneration report in this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, the Remuneration Committee discussed the Executive Board and Management Board Banking annual targets for 2020. The periodic performance assessments over 2019 and mid-year 2020 were also reviewed and discussed. With regard to variable compensation and the application of ING's accompanying Variable Remuneration Accrual Model, the committee received input and advice from the Risk Committee following strengthened risk management governance. This served as input for a review of the predefined thresholds above which the pool for variable remuneration may be unlocked for those eligible as well as the accompanying individual variable remuneration proposals, including potential cases for holdback of deferred compensation by way of malus.\n\nIn 2020, the committee paid specific attention to:\n\n- \u00b7 lessons learnt in relation to the application of the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model over 2019;\n- \u00b7 potential implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on ING's target setting and remuneration policies , by closely monitoring developments in this regard. This includes the views and expectations of the ECB, in particular regarding the impact that such policies may have on the maintenance of a finan cial institution' s sound capital base.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviewed the updates to ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework as part of an annual review. Throughout the year it assessed Identified Staff and High Earner-related remuneration matters, based on ING's accompanying governance framework.",

Ralph Hamers stepped down from his position and left ING as per 30 June 2020. After 29 years at ING, Ralph Hamers joined another financial institution on 1 September 2020.\n\nThe Supervisory Board initiated the succession planning for a new chief risk officer resulting in Ljiljana \u010cortan (formerly chief risk officer of another financial institution) being appointed as ING's chief risk officer and member of the Management Board Banking per 1 January 2021. The Supervisory Board will propose to shareholders to appoint her as member of the Executive Board and chief risk officer of ING Group at the Annual General Meeting in April 2021. Until 1 January 2021, the day-to-day risk management activities were performed ad interim by Karst Jan Wolters, reporting to Tanate Phutrakul.\n\nPinar Abay was appointed head of Market Leaders and member of the Management Board Banking, effective from 1 January 2020. Isabel Fernandez, member of the Management Board Banking and head of ING Wholesale Banking, stepped down from her position as per 31 December 2020. Succession planning has been initiated for this role.\n\nIn 2020, the Supervisory Board proposed to appoint three new members to its board. This was driven by several factors, such as easing the possible consequences of the retirement schedule of the Supervisory Board. The aim is to ensure that the Supervisory Board is at all times adequately composed to perform its duties.\n\nRobert Reibestein resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 1 January 2020 and Mike Rees took over his role as chairman of the Risk Committee. Eric Boyer de la Giroday and Hermann-Josef Lamberti (former vice-chairman of the Supervisory Board and chairman of the Audit Committee) retired from the Supervisory Board as per the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. From that same date, Mike Rees took over the role of vice-chairman of the Supervisory Board and Margarete Haase took over the role of chairperson of the Audit Committee.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting in April 2020, Juan Colomb\u00e1s, Herman Hulst and Harold Naus were appointed as new Supervisory Board members. All these appointments were approved by the ECB. The membership of Herman Hulst became effective as per the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting and he then also became a member of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee. The membership of Harold Naus also became effective as per the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting and he became a member of the Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The membership of Juan Colomb\u00e1s became effective per 1 October 2020 and he became a member of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee. In addition, Margarete Haase and Hans Wijers became members of the Risk Committee.\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee and the Supervisory Board will continue to strive for an adequate and balanced composition of the Supervisory Board when selecting and nominating new members for appointment, taking into account ING's diver sity policy and other factors. Read more in the Corporate governance chapter on the composition of the Supervisory Board committees at year-end 2020.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are requested to assess annually whether or not they are independent as set out in the Corporate Governance Code and to confirm this in writing. On the basis of these criteria, according to the Supervisory Board, all members of the Supervisory Board, are to be regarded as independent on 31 December 2020. On the basis of the NYSE listing standards, all members of the Supervisory Board are also to be regarded as independent.",

(ING Group), including information on ING Group's share capital, control, Executive Board, Supervisory Board and external auditor.\n\nThis chapter, including the parts of this Annual Report incorporated by reference, along with the separate publication 'ING's application of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code', comprise the Corporate Governance Statement 1 .\n\n## Corporate Governance related codes and practices\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nING Group uses the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (DCGC) as reference for its corporate governance structure and practices.\n\nING's application of the DCGC is described in the 2020 'Application of the Dutch Corporate Governance C ode by ING Groep N.V.', dated 8 March 2021, available on ing.com. This is to be read in conjunction with this chapter and is deemed to be incorporated into this chapter.\n\nThe DCGC can be downloaded from the website mccg.nl.\n\n## Dutch Banking Code\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code (Banking Code), is only applicable to ING Bank N.V. (ING Bank) and not to ING Group. However, ING Group voluntarily applies the principles of the Banking Code regarding remuneration to its Executive Board members and senior management. The application by ING Bank is\n\ndescribed in the 2020 publication 'Application of the Dutch Banking Code by ING Bank N.V.', dated 8 March 2021, available on ing.com.\n\nThe Banking Code can be downloaded from the website nvb.nl/english/.\n\n## Differences between Dutch and US corporate governance practices\n\nING Group is a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) organised under the laws of the Netherlands. It qualifies as a foreign private issuer under the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards. Under NYSE listing standards, listed companies that are foreign private issuers are permitted to follow home-country practice in some circumstances, in lieu of the provisions of the corporate governance rules contained in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual applicable to US-listed companies. In accordance with the requirements of the SEC and NYSE, ING Group must disclose in its Annual Report on Form 20-F any significant differences between its corporate governance practices and those applicable to US companies under NYSE listing standards. ING Group believes the following to be the significant differences between its corporate governance practices and the NYSE corporate governance rules applicable to US companies:\n\n- \u00b7 ING Group has a two-tier board structure, in contrast to the one-tier board structure used by most US companies. In the Netherlands, a public limited liability company with a two-tier board structure has an executive board as its management body and a supervisory board that advises and supervises the executive board. Supervisory board members are often former state or business leaders and sometimes former members of the executive board. A member of the executive board or other officer or employee of the company cannot simultaneously be a member of the supervisory board. The supervisory board must approve specified decisions of the executive board.\n- \u00b7 NYSE listing standards generally require a majority of boar d members to be 'independent' as determined under the NYSE listing standards. Under the DCGC, all members of the supervisory board, with the exception of not more than one person, should be 'independent' as determined under the DCGC. However, the definitio n of 'independent' under the DCGC differs in its details from the definition of 'independent' under the NYSE listing standards. In some cases, Dutch requirements",

All members of ING's Sup ervisory Board, are independent as determined under the DCGC.\n\n- \u00b7 NYSE listing standards require a US company to have a compensation committee and a nominating/corporate governance committee, each composed entirely of independent directors (as determined under the NYSE listing standards). ING's Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee and Remuneration Committee are composed entirely of members of the Supervisory Board who are independent as determined under the DCGC.\n- \u00b7 NYSE listing standards require that, when a member of the audit committee of a US company serves on four or more audit committees of public companies, the company should disclose (on its website, in its annual proxy statement or in its annual report filed with the SEC) that the board of directors has determined this simultaneous service would not impair the director's service to the company. Dutch law does not require the Supervisory Board to make such a determination.\n- \u00b7 In contrast to the NYSE listing standards, the DCGC contains an 'apply -orexplain' principle, offering the possibility of deviating from the DCGC. For any deviations by ING Group, please refer to the paragraph ' Dutch Corporate Governance Code '.\n- \u00b7 NYSE listing standards applicable to US companies require external auditors to be appointed by the audit committee . By contrast, Dutch law requires ING Group's external auditors to be appointed by the General Meeting and not by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for preparing the Superv isory Board's nomination to the General Meeting for the appointment and remuneration of ING Group's external auditor, and annually evaluates the independence and functioning of, and developments in the relationship with, ING Group's external auditor and in forms the Supervisory Board of its findings and proposed measures.\n- \u00b7 Under NYSE listing standards, shareholders of US companies must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and to approve material revisions to those plans, with limited exceptions set forth in the NYSE rules. The NYSE rules require a shareholder vote on all equity compensation plans applicable to any employee, director or other service provider of a company. The results of such votes are advisory in nature rather than binding. Under Dutch law and the DCGC,\n\nbinding shareholder approval is only required for equity compensation plans (or changes thereto) for members of the executive board and supervisory board, and not for equity compensation plans for other groups of employees.\n\n## Capital\n\n## Capital structure\n\nING Group's authorised share capital consists of ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares. Currently, only ordinary shares are issued. A call option to acquire cumulative preference shares has been granted to the ING Continuity Foundation (Stichting Continu\u00efteit ING). The acquisition of cumulative preference shares pursuant to the call option is subject to the restriction that, immediately after the issuance of cumulative preference shares, the total amount of cumulative preference shares outstanding may not exceed one third of the total issued share capital of ING Group (see ING Continuity Foundation report). The purpose of this call option is to protect the independence, continuity and identity of ING Group against influences that are contrary to its interests, its enterprise and the enterprises of its subsidiaries and all stakeholders (including, but not limited to, hostile takeovers). The ordinary shares are not used for protective purposes.\n\nThe board of ING Continuity Foundation comprises of four members who are independent of ING Group. No current or former Executive Board member, Supervisory Board member, ING Group employee or permanent adviser to ING Group is on the board of the ING Continuity Foundation. The board of the ING Continuity Foundation appoints its own members, after consultation with the Supervisory Board of ING Group, but without any requirement for approval by ING Group.\n\n## Read more in the 'ING Continuity Foundation report '.\n\nING Group's authorised capital is the maximum amount of capital allowed to be issued under the terms of the Articles of Association. New shares in excess of this amount can only be issued if the Articles of Association are amended. For flexibility purposes and in line with the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRRD) requirement that the amount of authorised share capital should at all times be sufficient to permit the issuance of as many ordinary shares as necessary for a potential future bail-in, ING Group seeks to set the authorised share capital in the Articles of Association at the highest level permitted by law, which is five times the actual issued share capital.",

Each year, a proposal is made to the General Meeting to delegate authority to the Executive Board to issue new ordinary shares or to grant rights to subscribe to new ordinary shares, both with and without preemptive rights for existing shareholders.\n\nThe set-up and content of the currently applicable share issue authorisation have been discussed with many investors, proxy advisors and other stakeholders in the context of the corporate governance review of 2016 and in the Annual General Meetings of 2016 and subsequent years; their feedback has been taken into account. It enables the Executive Board to issue new ordinary shares (including the granting of rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, such as warrants or in connection with convertible debt instruments) for a period of 18 months, ending on 28 October 2021 subject to the following conditions and limits:\n\n- \u00b7 No more than 40 percent of the issued share capital in connection with a rights issue, being a share offering to all shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings of ordinary shares as nearly as may be practical. However, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board may exclude certain shareholders from such a share offering for practical or legal reasons such as record dates, fractional entitlements, treasury shares, applicable legal restrictions on share offerings or in the context of a syndicated rights issue; plus\n- \u00b7 No more than 10 percent of the issued share capital, with or without pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders.\n\nSpecific approval by the General Meeting is required for any share issuance exceeding these limits.\n\nAs explained at the start of this paragraph, the purpose of this share issue authorisation is to delegate the power to issue new ordinary shares to the Executive Board, without first having to obtain the consent of the General Meeting, which in the Netherlands is subject to a statutory convocation period of at least 42 days. This authorisation gives ING Group flexibility in managing its capital resources, i ncluding regulatory capital, while taking into account shareholders' interests to prevent dilution of their shares. In particular, it enables ING Group to respond promptly to developments in the financial\n\nmarkets, should circumstances require that. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board consider it in the best interest of ING Group to have the flexibility this authorisation provides.\n\nThis authorisation may be used for any purpose, including but not limited to strengthening capital, financing, mergers or acquisitions. However, the authorisation to issue ordinary shares by way of rights issue cannot be used for mergers or acquisitions on a stock-for-stock basis as this is incompatible with the concept of pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders.\n\nIn line with market practice, ING Group currently intends to include the following categories of shareholders in such a rights issue:\n\n- 1. Qualified and retail investors in the Netherlands and the US (SEC registered offering); 2. Qualified investors in EU member states (and potentially the UK);\n- 3. Retail investors in EU member states (and potentially the UK) where ING has a significant retail investor base, provided that it is feasible to meet local requirements (in ING's 2009 rights offering, shares were offered to existing shareholders in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and the UK, where ING believed the vast majority of retail investors were located at that time); 4. Qualified or institutional investors in Canada and Australia.\n\nRetail investors in Canada and Australia and investors in Japan will not be included in such a share offering.\n\nShareholders who are not allowed, do not elect, or are unable to subscribe to a rights offering, are entitled to sell their rights in the market or receive any net financial benefit upon completion of a rump offering after the exercise period has ended.\n\nThe share issue authorisation that will be proposed to the 2021 Annual General Meeting will be similar to the current applicable authorisation described above.",

To become effective, ING Group has to acknowledge the transfer, unless ING Group itself is a party to the transfer. The Articles of Association do not restrict the transfer of ordinary shares, whereas the transfer of cumulative preference shares is subject to prior approval of the Executive Board. ING Group is not aware of the existence of any agreement pursuant to which the transfer of ordinary shares or American depositary receipts for such shares is restricted.\n\nShares that are included in the Securities Giro Transfer system are transferred in accordance with the Securities Giro Transfer Act (Wet Giraal Effectenverkeer). A shareholder, who wishes to transfer such shares, must instruct the securities intermediary where its shares are administered accordingly.\n\n## Repurchase of shares\n\nING Group may repurchase issued shares. Although the power to repurchase shares is vested in the Executive Board and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, prior authorisation from the General Meeting is required for these repurchases. Under Dutch law, this authorisation lapses after 18 months. Each year, a proposal is made to the General Meeting to authorise the repurchase of shares by the Executive Board for a period of 18 months.\n\nPursuant to this authorisation, no more than 10 percent of ING Group's share capital may be held as treasury shares. When repurchasing shares, the Executive Board must observe the price ranges prescribed in the authorisation. For the ordinary shares, the authorisation currently in force stipulates a minimum price of one eurocent and a maximum price equal to the highest stock price on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on the date on which the purchase agreement is concluded or on the preceding day of stock market trading.\n\n## Special rights of control\n\nNo special rights of control referred to in Article 10 of the directive of the European Parliament and the Council on takeover bids (2004/25/EC) are attached to any share.\n\n## Obligations to disclose shareholdings\n\nPursuant to section 5.3. of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Major Holdings Rules), any person who, directly or indirectly, acquires or disposes of an interest in the voting rights and/or the capital of (in short) a public limited company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands with an official listing on a stock exchange within the European Economic Area, as a result of which acquisition or disposal the percentage of his voting rights or capital interest - whether through ownership of shares, American depositary receipts (ADRs) or any other financial instrument, whether stock-settled or cash-settled, such as call or put options, warrants, swaps or any other similar contract - reaches, exceeds or falls below 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% or 95% is required to provide updated information on its holdings. With respect to ING, the Major Holdings Rules require any person whose interest in the voting rights and/or capital of ING reaches, exceeds or falls below those percentages whether through ownership of ordinary shares, ADRs or any other financial instruments whether stock settled or cash settled, such as call or put options, warrants, swaps or any other similar contract - to notify in writing the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) immediately after the acquisition or disposal of the triggering capital interest or voting rights.\n\nA notification requirement also applies if a person's capital interest or voting rights reaches, exceeds or falls below the abovementioned thresholds as a result of a change in ING's tot al issued share capital or voting rights. Such notification must be made no later than the fourth trading day after the AFM has published ING's notification of the change in its issued share capital.\n\nThe notification will be recorded in a public register that is held by the AFM and published on afm.nl/en/.\n\nDetails of investors, if any, who have reported their interest in ING Group pursuant to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (or the predecessor of this legislation), are included in the ING shares chapter,\n\nNon-compliance with the obligations of the Major Holdings Rules can lead to criminal prosecution or administrative law sanctions. In addition, a civil court can issue orders against any person who fails to notify or incorrectly notifies the AFM, in accordance with the Major Holdings Rules, including suspension of the voting right in respect of such person's ordinary shares.",

The Investor Relations department actively manages communications with existing and potential shareholders, holders of ADRs, bondholders, industry analysts and rating agencies.\n\nING Group strives to provide clear, accurate and timely financial information that is in strict compliance with applicable rules and regulations, in particular those concerning selective disclosure, inside information and equal treatment. In addition to the General Meetings, ING Group may communicate with its shareholders, the investment community and the general public through earnings announcements, presentations and meetings with analysts, investors and the press.\n\nING Group publishes a comprehensive quarterly disclosure package that includes detailed financial figures with relevant explanatory remarks. This information is discussed thoroughly on the day of the earnings release during media, analyst and investor conference calls. These are broadly accessible to interested parties. The publication dates of quarterly earnings releases are announced in advance on ing.com.\n\nING generally hosts one Investor Relations Day every two to three years; there was no such event held in 2020. These events are announced in advance on ing.com, and presentation materials are made available in real time on ing.com. This is in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements intended to ensure that all shareholders and other market participants have equal and simultaneous access to information that could potentially influence the price of ING Group's securities. ING Group's Investor Relations Days can be accessed by means of live webcasts. ING Group may also participate in industry conferences. These Investor Relations Days or conferences will not take place during the period immediately prior to the publication of quarterly financial results.\n\nING Group strives to maintain an open and constructive dialogue with existing and potential investors, and with industry analysts. The scope of such bilateral communication may range from responding to single investor queries via email, to more elaborate discussions with analysts or institutional investors by telephone, teleconference, video conferencing or face-toface. ING Group's Investor Relations department is the main point of contact for these communications. Executive Board members, Management Board Banking members or divisional management members may also participate in investor meetings. These meetings are not announced in advance, nor can they be followed by webcast or any other means. Information provided during such occasions or in any contacts with the press is limited to what is already publicly available.\n\nIf bilateral communication between ING Group and investors is organised and/or facilitated through a broker, then an analyst or specialist salesperson representing the broker may be present in the meeting.\n\nIn the event that any inside information is inadvertently disclosed during any bilateral contacts, it is ING Group's policy, in accordance with applicable regulations, to publish such information as soon as possible.",

This information includes the notice of the General Meeting, the agenda, instructions on how to participate in the meeting (either in person or by proxy), the place and time of the meeting, explanatory notes to the agenda including the verbatim text of the proposals, as well as the reports of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board.",

Such proposals should be adequately substantiated under applicable Dutch law.\n\nShareholders have the opportunity to contact ING about the General Meeting, via a dedicated webpage on ing.com.\n\n## Record date\n\nIn accordance with Dutch law, the record date for attending a general meeting and voting on proposals at that general meeting is the 28th day before the day of the General Meeting. Only those holding shares on the record date may attend the General Meeting and may participate, vote and exercise any other rights attached to their shares in the General Meeting, regardless of any subsequent sale or purchase of shares. The record date is published in the notice for the General Meeting. If a shortened convocation of 10 days is applicable (see 'Notice' above), the record date is two days after the convocation date.\n\nIn accordance with US requirements, the depositary sets a record date for the ADRs, which determines which ADRs are entitled to give voting instructions. This record date can differ from the record date set by ING Group for shareholders.\n\n## Attending General Meetings\n\nShareholders may attend a General Meeting in person or may grant a proxy in writing to a third party to attend the meeting and vote on their behalf. ING will make proxy forms available on ing.com before the General Meeting. For logistical reasons, attending the General Meeting, either in person or by proxy, is subject to the requirement that ING Group is notified in advance. Instructions for this are included in the notice for the General Meeting.\n\nGeneral Meetings are webcast on ing.com, so that shareholders who could not attend the General Meeting in person can nevertheless follow the meeting online.\n\n## Voting rights on shares\n\nEach share entitles the holder to cast one vote at the General Meeting. The Articles of Association do not restrict the voting rights on any class of shares. ING Group is not aware of any agreement that restricts voting rights on any class of its shares.\n\n## Proxy voting facilities\n\nING Group provides proxy voting facilities for its investors via ing.com and solicits proxies from its ADR holders in line with common practice in the US.\n\nProxy voting forms are made available on ing.com. By returning the form, shareholders give a proxy to an independent proxy holder (a public notary registered in the Netherlands), to vote on their behalf, in accordance with instructions expressly given on the proxy form. Submitting these forms is subject to additional conditions as specified on such forms.\n\nAs from 3 September 2020, ING Group will send an electronic confirmation of receipt of the votes to the person that casts the vote. In addition, on request made within three months from the date of the General Meeting, ING Group will confirm to the shareholder or a third person designated by the shareholder that the shareholder's votes have been validly recorded and counted by ING Group, if this information is not already available to the shareholder directly.\n\nTo encourage participation at the General Meeting, ING provides the EVO (e-voting) platform, an online facility through which shareholders can register for a meeting or appoint a proxy.\n\n## Reporting\n\nResolutions adopted at a General Meeting are generally published on ing.com within one week following the meeting. In accordance with the DCGC, the draft minutes of the General Meeting are made available to shareholders on ing.com no later than three months after the meeting. Shareholders then have three months to react to the draft minutes. After that, the minutes are adopted by the chairman of the meeting and by a shareholder appointed by that meeting and are made available on ing.com.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting was held in an adapted form in order to mitigate health risks for all participants and to comply with Dutch government directives.\n\nIn the context of the coro navirus pandemic and in line with European Central Bank's recommendations, the proposal to pay a final 2019 dividend (agenda item 3B) was not put up for a vote and was removed from the agenda. All other agenda items remained unchanged.\n\nThis year, a notarial record of the business transacted at the AGM 2020 was made.

For the appointment of Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board may draw up a binding list, which may be rendered non-binding by the General Meeting. A resolution of the General Meeting to render this list non-binding, or to suspend or dismiss Executive Board members without this being proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires an absolute majority of the votes cast. Additionally, this majority must represent more than half of the issued share capital. The Articles of Association exclude the waiver of the latter requirement in a second General Meeting. This ensures that significant shareholders proposals cannot be adopted in a General Meeting with a low attendance rate and can only be adopted with substantial support of ING Group's sh areholders.\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Executive Board are subject to a suitability and reliability assessment by the Dutch Central Bank and European Central Bank (DNB and ECB) and must continue to meet these while in function.\n\n## Function of the Executive Board\n\nThe Executive Board is charged with the management of ING Group. This includes responsibility for setting and achieving ING Group's strategy, objectives and policies, as well as ensuring the delivery of results. It also includes the day-to-day management of ING Group. The Executive Board is accountable for the performance of these duties to the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting. The responsibility for the management of ING Group is vested in the Executive Board collectively. The organisation, powers and modus operandi of the Executive Board are detailed in the Charter of the Management Board.\n\nThe Charter of the Management Board is available on ing.com.\n\nIn accordance with the Banker's Oath that is taken by the members of the Executive Board, they must carefully consider the interests of all stakeholders of ING. In that consideration they must put the customer's interests at the centre of all their activities.\n\nING Group indemnifies the members of the Executive Board against direct financial losses in connection with claims from third parties, as far as permitted by law, on the conditions laid down in the Articles of Association and their commission contract. ING Group has taken out liability insurance for the members of the Executive Board.\n\n## Profile of members of the Executive Board\n\nING Group aims for its Executive Board to have an adequate and balanced composition. The Supervisory Board regularly assesses the composition of the Executive Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has drawn up a profile to be used as a basis for selecting members of the Executive Board, which is available on ing.com. This profile among others includes guidelines that relate to the composition of the Executive Board.",

In addition, there should be a good balance in the experience of and affinity with the desired nature and culture of the business of ING. ING strives to have at least 30 percent of the seats held by women, and at least 30 percent of the seats by men.\n\nIn 2018, ING introduced a new principle in a bid to bolster diversity within our organisation. The 70 percent principle gives managers a basis for building mixed teams around appropriate dimensions of diversity (with a focus on gender, nationality and age group) and strives for a 30 percent difference in team composition. It is our ambition to adhere to this principle across the organisation within both local and global teams. This principle is incorporated into succession planning for the Executive Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for selecting and nominating candidates for appointment or reappointment to the Executive Board, among others based on the Executive Board profile.\n\nFinding suitable candidates remains challenging, as there are numerous requirements to take into account, including gender to enhance the composition of the Executive Board and specific criteria for each function, including regulatory requirements.\n\nAs an example to demonstrate the aforementioned: with the departure of the CEO Ralph Hamers on 30 June 2020, the Supervisory Board was faced with the challenge of appointing a successor. Considering all aspects the Supervisory Board appointed Steven van Rijswijk as the successor of Ralph Hamers with effect from 1 July 2020. The Supervisory Board concluded that Steven van Rijswijk has the right combination of experience, leadership skills and deep understanding of ING's business to lead ING into the next pha se of ING's strategic direction.\n\nWith the position change of Steven van Rijswijk on 1 July 2020, the CRO position became vacant. ING appointed Ljiljana \u010cortan as CRO of ING and member of the Management Board Banking with effective date 1 January 2021. The Supervisory Board will propose to the shareholders to appoint Ljiljana \u010cortan as member of the Executive Board at the AGM on 26 April 2021. In terms of the\n\ndimensions of diversity, Ljiljana \u010cortan will add both nationality and gender diversity to the Ex ecutive Board and Management Board in line with our 70 percent principle.\n\nSuccession planning for Executive Board positions is continuously worked on, balancing the career advancement of (female) senior managers, considering female candidates for the role and bringing in talents from outside the bank.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, there were no female members of the Executive Board. ING considers that the preferred gender balance will be achieved with the appointment of Ljiljana \u010cortan following the A GM on 26 April 2021.\n\nING is still looking long term and taking steps to improve the appointment of women in senior positions throughout the bank in line with the adopted diversity and inclusion principle.\n\nSee more information in Our people chapter.\n\n## Remuneration and share ownership\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are permitted to hold shares in the share capital of ING Group for long-term investment purposes. Transactions by members of the Executive Board in these shares are subject to the ING regulations for insiders. These regulations are available on ing.com.\n\nDetails of the remuneration of members of the Executive Board, including shares granted to them, together with additional information, are provided in the Remuneration report.\n\n## Ancillary positions/conflicting interests\n\nNo member of the Executive Board has corporate directorships at listed companies outside ING.\n\n## Transactions involving actual or potential conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the DCGC, transactions with members of the Executive Board in which there are significant conflicts of interest will be disclosed in the Annual Report.",

In the interim, the day-to-day risk management activities were performed by Karst Jan Wolters, reporting to chief financial officer Tanate Phutrakul.\n\n## Changes in the composition\n\nRalph Hamers stepped down from his position as CEO and chairman of the Executive Board of ING Groep N.V. and of the Management Board Banking of ING Bank N.V. as of 30 June 2020. He was succeeded by Steven van Rijswijk.\n\nThe Supervisory Board will propose to the shareholders to appoint Ljiljana \u010cortan as member of the Executive Board of ING Group at the AGM on 26 April 2021 (see 'Diversity and succession planning' above).\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the General Meeting. For the appointment of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board may draw up a binding list, which may be rendered non-binding by the General Meeting.\n\nA resolution of the General Meeting to render this list non-binding, or to suspend or dismiss Supervisory Board members without this being proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires an absolute majority of the votes cast. Additionally, this majority must represent more than half of the issued share capital. The Articles of Association exclude the waiver of the latter requirement in a second General Meeting. This ensures that significant proposals of shareholders cannot be adopted in a General Meeting with a low attendance rate and can only be adopted with substantial support of ING Group's shareholders.\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board are subject to a suitability and reliability assessment by the Dutch Central Bank and European Central Bank (DNB and ECB) and must continue to meet these while in function.\n\n## Function of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe function of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the policy (beleid) of the Executive Board and the general course of affairs of ING Group and the business connected with it, as well as to provide advice to the Executive Board.\n\nIn line with Dutch company law, the Articles of Association, the DCGC as well as the Charter of the Supervisory Board, all members of the Supervisory Board are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 be guided by the interests of ING Group and the business connected with it, thereby carefully balancing the interests of all stakeholders of ING and when drawing that balance, give paramount importance to the customer's interest, as set out in the Dutch Banker's Oath;\n- \u00b7 foster a culture focused on long-term value creation, financial and non-financial risk awareness, compliance with the Company's risk appetite, responsible and ethi cal behaviour and stimulate openness and accountability within ING and its subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 perform their duties without mandate and independent of any interest in the business of ING;\n- \u00b7 ensure that it functions effectively.\n- \u00b7 refrain from supporting one interest without regard to the other interests involved; and\n\nAccording to the Banker's Oath that is taken by the members of the Supervisory Board, they must carefully consider the interests of all stakeholders of ING. In that consideration they must put the customer's interests at the centre of all their activities. Certain resolutions of the Executive Board, specified in the Articles of Association, in the Charter of the Management Board and in the Charter of the Supervisory Board, are subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association ING Group indemnifies the members of the Supervisory Board as far as legally permitted against direct financial losses in connection with claims from third parties lodged or threatened to be lodged against them by virtue of their service as a member of the Supervisory Board.",

        "page_content": "- > Corporate governance\n\n## Profile of members of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board has drawn up a profile to be used as a basis for its composition. It is available on ing.com.\n\nIn view of their experience and the valuable contribution that former members of the Executive Board can make to the Supervisory Board, it has been decided, taking into account the size of the Supervisory Board and ING's wide range of activities that such individuals may become members of the Supervisory Board of ING Group. Former Executive Board members must wait at least one year before becoming eligible for appointment to the Supervisory Board.\n\nFormer members of the Executive Board are not eligible for appointment to the position of chairman or vice-chairman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAfter a former member of the Executive Board has been appointed to the Supervisory Board, this member may also be appointed to one of the Supervisory Board's committees. However, appointment to the Audit Committee is only possible if the individual in question resigned from the Executive Board at least three years prior to such appointment.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of ING shall consist of a mix of persons with executive experience, preferably gained in the banking sector, experience in corporate governance of large stock-listed companies and experience in the political and social environment in which such companies operate. In the selection of Supervisory Board members, ING is striving for a balance in nationality, gender, age, and educational and work background. In addition, there should be a balance in the experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the business of ING and its subsidiaries. More specifically ING strives to have at least 30 percent of the seats held by women, and at least 30 percent of the seats by men. These guidelines that relate to the composition of the Supervisory Board, are laid down in the Supervisory Board Profile. Based on this profile, the Supervisory Board is responsible for selecting and nominating candidates for appointment or reappointment to the Supervisory Board.\n\nWith respect to gender diversity, three female members currently serve on the Supervisory Board: Mariana Gheorghe, Margarete Haase and Herna Verhagen, resulting in the Supervisory Board meeting its 30 percent gender diversity target.\n\nWe believe the Supervisory Board is well balanced in terms of other relevant diversity aspects. Overall, the preferred emphasis on members with a financial or banking background has been maintained. In terms of nationality, the ratio between Dutch and non-Dutch nationalities in 2020 was 56 - 44 percent.\n\nOther diversity related aspects are also taken into consideration in light of the overall Supervisory Board composition (see Supervisory Board report).\n\n## Term of appointment of members of the Supervisory Board\n\nAs a general rule, Supervisory Board members step down from the Supervisory Board in the 4th, 8th, 10th or 12th year after their initial appointment. They are eligible for re-appointment in the 4th year after their initial appointment and, with explanation, also in the 8th and 10th year.\n\nUnder special circumstances the Supervisory Board may, with explanation, deviate from this general rule, for instance to maintain a balanced composition of the Supervisory Board and/or to preserve valuable expertise and experience. The retirement schedule is available on ing.com.\n\n## Ancillary positions/conflicting interests\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board may hold other positions, including directorships, either paid or unpaid.\n\nCRD IV restricts the total number of supervisory board positions or non-executive directorships with commercial organisations that may be held by a Supervisory Board member to four, or to two, if the Supervisory Board member also has an executive board position. The European Central Bank may, under special circumstances, permit a Supervisory Board member to fulfil an additional supervisory board position or non-executive directorship. Positions with, inter alia, subsidiaries or qualified holdings are not taken into account in the application of these restrictions. Such positions may not conflict with the interests of ING Group. It is the responsibility of the individual member of the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board collectively to ensure that the directorship duties are performed properly and are not affected by any other positions that the individual may hold outside ING Group.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are to disclose material conflicts of interest (including potential conflicts of interest) and to provide all relevant information relating to them. The Supervisory Board -excluding the member concerned -decides whether a conflict of interest exists.",

Such relationships are not reported, with the exception of any loans that may have been granted.\n\nFor an overview of loans granted to members of the Supervisory Board, see the Remuneration report.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are requested to assess annually whether the criteria of dependence set out in the DCGC do not apply to them and to confirm this in writing. On the basis of these criteria, all members of the Supervisory Board are to be regarded as independent on 31 December 2020. On the basis of the NYSE listing standards, all members of the Supervisory Board are independent.\n\n## Permanent committees of the Supervisory Board\n\nOn 31 December 2020, the Supervisory Board had four permanent committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee and the Remuneration Committee.

The Risk Committee shall prepare the discussions within and decisions of the Supervisory Board on such matters. On 31 December 2020, the members of the Risk Committee were: Mike Rees (chairman), Jan Peter Balkenende, Juan Colomb\u00e1s, Mariana Gheorghe, Margarete Haase, Herman Hulst, Harold Naus and Hans Wijers.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists and advises the Supervisory Board with the performance of its duties in relation to the integrity and quality of the Company's financial reporting and the related effectiveness of the Company's internal risk management and control systems and shall prepare the discussions within and the decisions of the Supervisory Board on such matters.

ING Group subsidiaries may have customary change of control arrangements included in agreements related to various business activities, such as joint-venture agreements, letters of credit and other credit facilities, ISDAagreements, hybrid capital and debt instruments, insurance and reinsurance agreements and futures and option trading agreements. Following a change of control of ING Group (as a result of a public bid or otherwise) such agreements may be amended or terminated, leading, for example, to an obligatory transfer of the interest in the joint venture, early repayment of amounts due, loss of credit facilities or reinsurance cover, and liquidation of outstanding futures and option trading positions.\n\n## Severance payments to members of the Executive Board\n\nThe contracts entered into with the members of the Executive Board provide for severance payments that become due upon termination of the applicable member's contract, including if termination occurs in connection with a public bid as defined in section 5:70 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.

At the AGM held on 23 April 2019, KPMG was re-appointed for this role for the financial years 2020 through 2023. This appointment includes the responsibility to audit the financial statements of ING Group for the financial year 2020; to audit the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting on 31 December 2020; to report on the outcome of these audits to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board; and to provide an audit opinion on the financial statements of ING Group. Additionally, KPMG performs a review of the sustainability information in the annual report to obtain limited assurance and for a number of nonfinancial KPI's reasonable assurance, about whether this information is free fr om material misstatement. As sustainability is of strategic importance to ING, KPMG is involved in providing assurance on this information.\n\nThe external auditor may be questioned at the AGM about its audit opinion on the financial statements. The external auditor will therefore attend and is entitled to address this meeting. In 2020, the external auditor attended the meetings of the Risk Committee and of the Audit Committee. It also attended and addressed the 2020 AGM, at which it was questioned on its audit opinion.\n\nAll services of the external auditor to ING Group and its subsidiaries are subject to approval by the Audit Committee, in line with the ING Group policy on External Auditor Independence.\n\nMore information on ING Group's policy on External Auditor Independence is available on ing.com.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nING's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nDue to the listing of ING shares on the New York Stock Exchange, ING Group is required to comply with the SEC regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX 404. These regulations require ING Group to report and certify on an annual basis on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The SOX 404 internal control activities are organised along the lines of the company's governance structure, and involve the participation of senior management across ING.\n\nING's internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ING;\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisations of our management and directors; and\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nING has a process in place where, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is evaluated, based on the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Reporting -Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).",

It is designed to mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;\n- \u00b7 Reliability of financial and non-financial information;\n- \u00b7 Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies, and the ING Values as part of the Orange Code;\n- \u00b7 Safeguarding of assets, identification and management of liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 Strategic goals of ING Groep N.V.\n\nThe Risk Management section as part of the Report of the Executive Board elaborates on ING's identified financial and non-financial risks (such as credit risk, solvency risk, market risk, operational risk, IT risk, model risk, compliance risk, funding and liquidity risk, environmental, social and governance risk and business risk) and how these risks are managed. These chapters provide insight into the potential impact on the results of ING Groep N.V. that come forth from these identified risks. The design and functioning of the internal risk management and control systems is based on the Risk Appetite Framework and the Non-Financial Risk Framework. Both frameworks, explained in detail in the Risk Management section, combine various financial and non-financial risk disciplines into a single converged approach and provide the businesses with an overview on their risks and the way these are managed.\n\nThis view allows the Executive Board and senior management to form an opinion on the adequacy of internal risk management and control systems regarding the risks they face while pursuing the Executive Board's strategy. In addition ING has a process in place where, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, ING assesses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, based on the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Reporting -Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).\n\nThe design and the operation of the internal risk management and control systems are discussed annually with the Risk Committee and the full Supervisory Board, whereas the design and the operation of internal control over financial reporting are discussed annually with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. As part of this process, improvement in the bank-wide know your customer (KYC) enhancement operations were discussed with the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nWe are continuing our global KYC enhancement operations, emphasising regulatory compliance as the key priority. The organisation continues to work hard on enhancing our customer due diligence files and on a number of structural solutions to bring our anti-money laundering activities to a sustainably better level.\n\nIn discharging the responsibility for ING 's internal risk management and control systems, the Executive Board has made an assessment of the effectiveness of the ING Groep N.V.'s internal control and risk management systems. Based on this assessment, the Executive Board states that during the year under review:\n\n- \u00b7 the report of the Executive Board in the ING Group Annual report 2020 provides sufficient insights into the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems;\n- \u00b7 those systems provide reasonable assurance that the ING Group Annual report 2020 does not contain material inaccuracies;\n- \u00b7 based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the ING Group Annual report 2020 is prepared on a going concern basis; and\n- \u00b7 the report of the Executive Board in the ING Group Annual Report 2020 states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of ING Groep N.V.'s continuity for the period of 12 months after the preparation of this report.",

First and foremost, it's a human tragedy that has affected the lives, jobs and wellbeing of people everywhere, including our customers and employees. Naturally, it also affected our business performance, which has a direct impact on the way we recognise and reward many of our employees. In this context there will be no changes to remuneration for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board in 2021 and the Executive Board will forgo their variable remuneration for performance year 2020.\n\nING's approach to remuneration is designed to attract, motivate and retain people with the skills, abilities, values and behaviours needed to achieve its strategy. At the same time, we have a responsibility to be balanced and fair, taking into account all our stakeholders in what was, and continues to be, a difficult environment.\n\nThat's why we aim to have an ongoing dialogue with our regulators, customers, shareholders , works councils and other stakeholder groups. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, we engaged with our stakeholders in 2020 mainly through indirect and online channels. This included consultations in preparation for this year's remuneration approach, streng thening the link between performance and remuneration outcomes. We will continue these interactions in 2021.\n\n## Our view on remuneration\n\nING seeks to effectively reward success and avoid rewarding for failure. We aim to offer well-balanced remuneration that focuses on creating short- and long-term value for all our stakeholders. We make our biggest contribution to society through our business: processing payments, providing loans and protecting people's money. At the same time, as a gatekeep er to the financial system we have responsibility to keep our bank safe, secure and compliant. Achieving the balance between our function as a bank and managing the inherent risks this brings, is reflected in our remuneration approach.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These principles apply to all employees, including members of the Executive Board.\n\nThe 2020 Remuneration Report is subject to an advisory vote at the AGM in April 2021. In the report we look back on the year 2020. We report on ING's performance and how 2020 events such as the coronavirus pandemic impacted our business results and subsequently remuneration. We explain how the Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies are implemented and share details of remuneration awarded in 2020 to the Executive Board and to the Supervisory Board. In addition, we also set out the key performance indicators for the year ahead.\n\nHalfway through the year, Steven van Rijswijk succeeded Ralph Hamers as chief executive officer. The same remuneration principles apply to him as did to his predecessor. As such, Steven's remuneration until 1 July 2020 is reflected in his previous role as chief risk officer, and in the second half of the year as CEO.\n\nIn line with ING's commitment to increase transparency and accountability, this year we provide insight into the organisational as well as the personal performance objectives of the Executive Board members. Among other things we aim to clarify the performance metrics used for awarding variable remuneration, how targets are set, how achievements are measured, and the important role risk management plays in influencing remuneration, including the pre- and post award risk assessment.\n\nIn addition, we set out the remuneration approach that applies to all employees. We explain more about how remuneration works within ING. This includes the performance management process and its link to remuneration, as well as the measures we have in place to mitigate risk.\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nThis 2020 Remuneration Report is the first to reflect ING's new Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies, which came into effect on 1 January 2020. The policies were drawn up based on the various viewpoints, interests, remarks and concerns of our stakeholder groups. When presented in March 2020, stakeholders were largely positive. At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in April 2020, shareholders approved the Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies with 94.4% and 98.6% of the votes respectively.\n\nUnder the 2020 policy, and in line with the requirements laid down in the Dutch Banking Code, the total direct compensation of the Executive Board is below the median of our peer group. This group is selected on the basis of geography, talent market, size and governance framework, as well as a balancing factor to ensure relevance of our benchmark. Our peer group in 2020 consists of eight comparable Dutch companies and eight relevant European financial services providers, which are listed in the 'Total direct compensation' paragraph.\n\n## Performance year 2020\n\nThe impact of the global coronavirus pandemic reverberated across all of our businesses in all locations. While 2020 was a tough year, ING's financial results remained resilient and we continued to attract more primary customers, even during the wide-spread lockdowns that took place around the world. At the same time, the economic headwinds required us to remain flexible and sharpen our focus on activities that will ensure ING delivers on its strategic priorities. And of course, there is a link between performance and remuneration.\n\nIn light of the economic headwinds and the pressure Covid-19 placed on our business, our customers and on society, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board jointly agreed that the Executive Board members will not receive any variable remuneration related to the performance year 2020. Additionally, the Supervisory Board decided not to increase the base salary of Executive Board members from 1 January 2021. The fees for the Supervisory Board will also be unchanged for 2021.",

The total amount awarded was significantly lower than for the previous year, reflecting declining financial performance and recognising broader stakeholder interests. The biggest reductions occur at the more senior levels of the organisation (see '2020 specifics' for more information). This is in line with the recommendations of the European Central Bank urging moderation with respect to awarding variable remuneration. Similarly, ING complies with the prevailing ECB recommendation on shareholder distributions.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to every ING employee, at every level of the organisation, for their ongoing commitment and dedication over the past year. It hasn't always been easy to adapt to working at a distance, often while also juggling the demands of family life or recovering from illness. Yet even in the most challenging circumstances, they have shown true orange spirit and continued to take things on and make them happen for customers, for ING and for all stakeholders.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)\n\n## About this report\n\nThis Remuneration Report explains the 2020 Executive Board remuneration policy (hereafter called the 2020 EB remuneration policy) and 2020 Supervisory Board remuneration policy (hereafter called the 2020 SB remuneration policy) and how these have been implemented. Both these policies were approved at the 2020 AGM. This section of the report (p. 223 -p. 240) is the Remuneration Report as referred to in the Dutch act implementing the Shareholder Rights Directive II (SRD II). It will be presented to shareholders at the 2021 AGM for an advisory vote. An explanation of how the results of this vote are taken into account will be included in the 2021 Remuneration Report.\n\nThis report is prepared in the spirit of the draft (nonbinding) 'Guidelines on the standardised presentation of the remuneration report' from the European Commission published in March 2019. Although the finalised guidelines were expected to be published in 2020, these were not available at the time of preparing this report. In that context therefore, 2020 should still be considered a transitional year though with increased transparency where possible. This is for instance processed in the paragraphs '2020 Executive Board performance assessment & reward process' and '2020 Executive Board performance evaluation' . In the 2021 Remuneration Report we aim to disclose fully in line with the final guidelines (if available).\n\n## 2020 AGM\n\nThe 2019 Remuneration Report was presented for an advisory vote at the AGM held on 28 April 2020 (hereafter called the 2020 AGM). The outcome was that 93.4% of shareholders were in favour of the report. There were no additional comments or questions on the advisory vote, aside from the ask for additional transparency on variable remuneration of the Executive Board. As explained at the 2020 AGM, the 2019 Remuneration Report included a new approach for Executive Board variable remuneration also setting out how this links to performance as of performance year 2020. The 2020 Remuneration Report aims to provide greater transparency regarding the Executive Board performance, as also promised during our stakeholder consultation.\n\nIn addition to the 2019 Remuneration Report, the 2020 EB remuneration policy and 2020 SB remuneration policy were up for a binding vote at the 2020 AGM. To come to a balanced proposal we incorporated feedback from the broad stakeholder consultation carried out in the autumn and winter of 2019. This extensive stakeholder reach-out was essential before any decision over 2020 was taken. The vote was 94.4% in favour of the EB remuneration policy and 98.6% in favour of the SB remuneration policy. Both policies were adopted by shareholders and became effective retroactively from 1 January 2020 until the 2024 AGM at the latest.\n\nWe remain aware of the fact that remuneration is an important topic for many stakeholder groups and that viewpoints on the topic may vary. The Supervisory Board is fully committed to ensuring that our approach to remuneration achieves a balance that aligns the best interest of ING and the viewpoints of our stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement is a key element in the formulation of our remuneration policies, as demonstrated by the extensive process we carried out in 2019. The Supervisory Board will continue to foster a transparent dialogue on remuneration and future policy amendments.\n\n## Board changes and business events 2020\n\nRalph Hamers stepped down as chief executive officer (CEO) and member of the Executive Board of ING Group on 30 June 2020. The Supervisory Board appointed Steven van Rijswijk as his successor from 1 July 2020. Steven van Rijswijk, who was ING's chief risk officer (CRO), was already a member of the Executive Board. The agreed remuneration package for Steven van Rijswijk is the same as for the previous CEO and in line with the 2020 EB remuneration policy.",

Should policy changes be proposed, we will first engage with our stakeholders to inform and discuss the proposed changes, after which a revised version of the 2020 EB remuneration policy will be submitted for adoption by shareholders at the General Meeting before it becomes effective. Please note that the following paragraphs, until page 227, present a brief summary of the current applicable 2020 EB remuneration policy.\n\n## Total direct compensation\n\nTotal direct compensation is the total of fixed and variable remuneration, excluding benefits such as pension and allowances.\n\nTotal direct compensation for the Executive Board members is determined and reviewed periodically by the Supervisory Board. In l ine with the 2020 EB remuneration policy, the Executive Board's total direct compensation for 2020 was compared to a new peer group as formulated in the 2020 EB remuneration policy. This peer group is based on five guiding principles, reflecting ING's curr ent profile, and further explained in the 2020 EB remuneration policy. These principles can be described as follows.\n\n| Guiding principle   | Short description                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Geography           | ING is headquartered in the Netherlands, but has an international profile                                                                 |\n| Talent market       | ING is increasingly experiencing a cross-pollination of talent across  sectors/industries, not limited to traditional banking competitors |\n| Size                | ING acknowledges the importance of including companies that are  broadly comparable in terms of size and complexity                       |\n| Governance          | ING is subject to the Dutch (financial services) regulatory framework and  operates within a Dutch stakeholder environment                |\n| framework           |                                                                                                                                           |\n| Balancing           | ING acknowledges the importance of retaining sight of relevant peer  companies that do not match on the other criteria                    |\n\nIn line with the Dutch Banking Code, the peer group should consist of both financial and non-financial companies, taking into account the relevant international context. In addition, the Supervisory Board decided to exclude the UK and Switzerland from our peer group, due to very different pay structures in their financial sectors. Smaller banks and companies were also excluded because these are less complex compared to a large enterprise like ING. The composition of the peer group is explicitly not included in the 2020 EB remuneration policy. In 2020, the peer group comprised: 1\n\n| ABN AMRO   | Ahold Delhaize   | BBVA            | Deutsche Bank    |\n|------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Aegon      | ASML             | Banco Santander | Intesa Sanpaolo  |\n| NN Group   | Heineken         | BNP Paribas     | Societe Generale |\n| Rabobank   | Philips          | Credit Agricole | UniCredit        |\n\nWe aim to keep our peer group as constant as possible. In line with the requirements laid down in the Dutch Banking Code the total direct compensation under the 2020 EB remuneration policy is below the median of the peer group. The calculation of the position towards the median of the peer group has been performed based on the actual fixed remuneration 2020 and the actual variable remuneration related to performance year 2019. Due to the fact that there was no variable remuneration related to the current performance year (2020), we use the variable remuneration related to the previous performance year (2019) for this calculation.",

The Remuneration Committee reviews the individual base salaries of the Executive Board members each year and advises the Supervisory Board on this. The Supervisory Board has the discretion to increase the individual base salaries annually. The below factors are given consideration in determining their base salaries:\n\n- \uf0a0 the individual's level of skill and performance;\n- \uf0a0 ING's business performance, and market conditions;\n- \uf0a0 internal pay ratios and salary increases for other employees within ING;\n- \uf0a0 remuneration level at the external peer group;\n- \uf0a0 public indexation reference points (e.g. consumer price index); and\n- \uf0a0 stakeholder views.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nVariable remuneration for Executive Board members is limited to a maximum of 20% of base salary in line with legislative requirements. At least 50% of this is based on non-financial performance criteria. The 2020 EB remuneration policy provides for an at-target variable remuneration of 16% of base salary. If performance criteria are exceeded, the Supervisory Board can increase the variable component to the maximum. If performance is below target, the variable component will be decreased, potentially to zero. All variable remuneration is awarded fully in shares. There is a minimum holding period of five years from the award date plus an additional holding year as of the vesting date. This combination (i.e. all shares plus a long holding period) fosters alignment with shareholders and a focus on the long term.\n\nThe Supervisory Board pre-determines the performance criteria for the Executive Board each year to ensure alignment between ING's strategy, performance objectives and long-term interest.\n\nFor further details on the pay-out of variable remuneration please see the 2020 EB remuneration policy which is disclosed in full on ing.com under the section 'Remuneration'.\n\nOn the right, is a visual illustrating the potential pay-out scheme of variable remuneration for Executive Board members.\n\nTotal variable remuneration relating to performance year 2020 comprises *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2027\n\n- * Fully delivered in shares.\n- ** All awards subject to holdback and clawback provisions and a minimum five-year holding period from award.",

This is the same as for all employees working in the Netherlands without a supplementary pension scheme. Executive Board members are compensated for the lack of pension accrual above this amount by means of a savings allowance (see 'Benefits'), to be annually determined, on the same terms that apply to other participants in the Dutch pension scheme. The set-up of this compensation for the lack of pension accrual is in line with best practices.\n\n## Benefits\n\nExecutive Board members are eligible for additional benefits, such as:\n\n- \uf0a0 the use of a company car;\n- \uf0a0 contributions to company savings plans;\n- \uf0a0 individual savings allowance;\n- \uf0a0 expatriate allowances (if applicable);\n- \uf0a0 banking and insurance benefits from ING (on the same terms as for other employees of ING in the Netherlands);\n- \uf0a0 tax and financial planning services to ensure compliance with the relevant legislative requirements.\n\n## Tenure\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are appointed by shareholders at the AGM for a maximum period of four years. They may be reappointed by shareholders at the General Meeting in line with ING's Articles of Association and applicable rules and regulation. Executive Board members have a commission contract for an indefinite period. ING has the option to terminate the contract if a member is not reappointed by shareholders at the AGM, or if their membership of the Executive Board is terminated. There is a three-month notice period for individual board members and a sixmonth period for ING. During this time the board member continues to work and in principle remains eligible for all agreed remuneration components.\n\nIn the event of an involuntary exit, Executive Board members are eligible for an exit arrangement. If termination of the contract is based on mutual agreement, the Executive Board member is also eligible for a severance payment. These arrangements are subject to specific requirements (e.g. limited to a maximum of one year of fixed base salary and under the condition that there should be no reward for failure). If an Executive Board member departs voluntarily or in circumstances involving fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct or any activity detrimental to ING, no severance payment or award of variable remuneration over the performance year will be made.\n\n## Periodic review of the Executive Board remuneration policy and the remuneration awarded\n\nIn accordance with the 2020 EB remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board annually determines the actual remuneration for members of the Executive Board, based on advice from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's responsibilities include preparing the Supervisory Board for decisions regarding the individual remuneration of members of the Executive Board. Remuneration proposals for individual Executive Board members are drawn up in accordance with the 2020 EB remuneration policy and cover the following aspects: remuneration structure, the amount of the fixed and variable remuneration components, the performance criteria used, scenario analyses that were carried out and, if and when considered appropriate stakeholder engagement, review of the EB remuneration policy, the pay ratios within the company and its affiliated enterprises. In the performance of its tasks the Remuneration Committee works closely together with the Risk Committee. The Remuneration Committee takes note of the views of individual Executive Board members with regard to the amount and structure of their own remuneration, including the aspects mentioned above.\n\n## Special employment conditions\n\nSpecial employment conditions, for example to secure the recruitment of new executives, may be used in exceptional circumstances subject to approval by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board aims to minimise these payments and ensure they are compliant with regulatory requirements. This is in line with the 2020 EB remuneration policy. In 2020, there were none.",

Deemed most relevant for this ratio is the total direct compensation of the CEO compared to the average total direct compensation of all ING employees. On this basis, the internal ratio in 2020 was 1:28 (2019: 1:31, 2018: 1:29). For the sake of transparency we also calculate the ratio of total direct compensation for other Executive Board members compared to the average total direct compensation of all ING employees. On that basis the internal ratio in 2020 was 1:19 (2019: 1:21, 2018: 1:20). 3 The lower ratios for 2020 compared to 2019, are mainly because the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board jointly agreed that the Executive Board members will not receive any variable remuneration award related to the performance year 2020.\n\nAs was announced in February 2020, Ralph Hamers stepped down from his position as ING's CEO and chairman of the Executive Board on 30 June 2020. As his departure was voluntary, no exit arrangements were agreed or paid, in line with the 2020 EB remuneration policy. All outstanding variable remuneration that was awarded in previous years and not yet vested before his departure, has lapsed. This means he will not receive any future pay-outs of variable remuneration related to previous performance years.\n\n## Remuneration versus company performance and average employee remuneration\n\nThe table on the next page shows the link between directors' remuneration (Executive Board and Supervisory Board members), company performance and the average remuneration of an ING employee. This is carried out by showing the development of the remuneration for Executive Board and Supervisory Board members over the last five years presented in percentages. With respect to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board, it should be noted that there is no link to company performance in order to safeguard its independent role. No component of the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members is linked to company performance, since this is all and only dependant on attendance.\n\nThe relative performance of the company is presented on three different metrics over the last five years. The metrics consist of:\n\n- \uf0a0 Retail primary relationships\n- \uf0a0 Profit before tax for ING Group\n- \uf0a0 Return on equity based on IFRS-EU Equity.\n\nFinally, we present the development of the remuneration on average (per employee). For this number we use the same data as is used to determine the internal ratio. As ING has only disclosed the internal ratio since 2017, no comparison for 2016 and 2015 is presented.\n\nDue to the strict regulations on variable remuneration in the Netherlands (i.e. 20% bonus cap) and to the fact that Executive Board members were not awarded any variable remuneration for performance year 2020, the link between remuneration and company performance is correlated but limited. Furthermore, the requirement that variable remuneration must be based on at least 50% nonfinancial targets means there is only a partial relationship between the company's financial performance and the remuneration of Executive Board members.",

This process serves as the foundation to determine the variable remuneration for Executive Board members.\n\n| Target setting      | Check-ins          | Year-end review    | Risk assessment    |\n|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| before the start of | quarterly during   | after the end of   | after the end of   |\n| the financial year  | the financial year | the financial year | the financial year |\n\nAt the start of the performance year, the Supervisory Board approves the financial and non-financial performance measures applicable to Executive Board members for the upcoming financial year:\n\n- \uf0a0 Financial performance measures including profit-based and return-based measures.\n- \uf0a0 Non-financial performance measures including customer, people, strategy and sustainability measures.\n\nEach performance measure is weighted and totals 100%. The Dutch Remuneration Policy for Financial Enterprises Act (Wet Beloningsbeleid Financi\u00eble Ondernemingen, WBFO) specifies that at least 50% of variable remuneration metrics must be based on non-financial targets. The performance measures for the CEO and CFO are based on group performance. The measures for the CRO are based 75% on functional key performance indicators (KPIs) and 25% on group results, in line with regulations for control functions.\n\nThroughout the year, regular conversations take place between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board to review their performance to date. While no formal assessments are completed, progress of performance measures is discussed and the extent to which progress is on track.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee are both responsible for providing input into and assessing the performance of the Executive Board members to determine the variable remuneration to be awarded. They jointly advise the Supervisory Board on the recommendations to get final approval of the awards. This follows a multi-step and integrated process that closely aligns with the way that variable remuneration is determined for the wider ING workforce. The process covers an assessment of their performance, based on individual performance scorecards. It includes KPIs and targets agreed at the beginning of the performance year, along with risk assessments measured on an ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment basis.\n\nThe core performance scorecard for each Executive Board member consists of both quantitative and qualitative-based KPIs. Quantitative-based KPIs are assessed on a primarily formulaic basis where the expected target performance level must be achieved before the on-target pay-out can be earned. Qualitative-based KPIs are assessed using a standard three-point rating scale: 1 = maximum = exceeding expectations; 2 = target = meeting expectations; 3 = threshold = not meeting expectations. The overall outcome of the performance scorecard assessment based on the above is the 'starting point' for determining the variable remuneration of the Executive Board members.\n\nThe integrated performance assessment process for determining variable remuneration also takes into account financial and operational performance, risk and compliance, as well as behaviour and conduct of each Executive Board member. This is supported by a robust framework for considering risk and conduct, which is in line with regulations. It includes the following elements:",

This is line with all employees who are eligible for discretionary variable remuneration. See 'Performance hurdles' for further details.\n- \uf0a0 Risk tests and adjustments -Performance under three metrics (covering financial and nonfinancial risk) is considered against thresholds set at the beginning of the financial year, taking into account ING's risk appetite statement framework. When these risk tests are not within the risk appetite it may lead to a downward variable remuneration adjustment.\n- \uf0a0 Ex-post risk assessment -Adjustments may be made based on risk management performance, including events that had a financial or reputational impact on ING. Risk and Human Resources also assess potential holdbacks or clawbacks impacting variable remuneration.\n\nThe CRO is responsible for recommending any risk-adjustments to variable remuneration awards. The final decision is at the level of the Supervisory Board.

Although it was decided to forgo variable remuneration, in the table on the left the individual performance of the members of the Executive Board against their set-targets is shown to illustrate the performance to stakeholders.\n\nAs Steven van Rijswijk had a split year as CRO and then CEO, his award was calculated against the CEO performance results (50%) and the CRO performance results (50%).\n\nIn the second half of the year, risk management reported into CFO Tanate Phutrakul ad interim, in addition to his role as CFO. As such, his variable remuneration award was calculated against the CFO performance results for the full year, also taking into consideration the CRO performance results for the second half of the year.\n\nFollowing the performance hurdles a thorough performance assessment has been completed including ex-ante risk tests. Based on this assessment and the overall achievements, the Supervisory Board has concluded that the Executive Board members delivered relatively strong results despite a challenging year due to Covid-19.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board considered if any discretionary adjustment was required and they determined both the financial and non-financial results speak for themselves in the current environment. Furthermore the Supervisory Board considers the behaviour of the Executive Board members and following their assessment no discretionary adjustments were applied.\n\nIn the final step, the Supervisory Board reviewed the CRO's assessment of ex -post risk adjustments. Whilst the Global KYC program has made clear progress in 2020 and has delivered on most milestones it was considered a 90% modifier (10% discount) to the CEO portion of his 2020 variable remuneration award would be applied.\n\nFollowing this performance assessment process the resulting variable remuneration awards for Steven van Rijswijk would have been \u20ac158,139 and for Tanate Phutrakul \u20ac109,338.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\nOverall this would have equated to  variable remuneration for the CEO at 10.6% of his maximum 20% cap and a 34.1% reduction against target. For the CFO it would represent 9.0% of his maximum 20% cap and a 44.8% reduction against target. The ratio between base salary and total direct compensation is 100% (for 2020).\n\nAwards made to Executive Board members reflect the Supervisory Board's assessment of each of the Executive Board members' performance against the objectives in their scorecards, as outlined in the previous section. The Remuneration Committee also consulted the Risk Committee and took into consideration its feedback on risk and compliance matters. In addition to the modifier as stated above, there was no reasoning to apply any individual risk mitigating measures in accordance with ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework (IRRF). 5\n\n## 2020 Executive Board remuneration\n\n| Total remuneration  Amounts in euros (rounded  figures)   | Base salary   | Variable  remuneration   | Total direct  compensation   | Pension   | Emoluments   | Total  remuneration   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| Ralph Hamers                                              | 888,100       | -                        | 888,100                      | 11,600    | 779,900      | 1,679,600             |\n| Steven van Rijswijk (CEO role)                            | 888,100       | -                        | 888,100                      | 11,600    | 242,000      | 1,141,700             |\n| Tanate Phutrakul                                          | 1,221,700     | -                        | 1,221,700                    | 23,300    | 358,500      | 1,603,500             |\n| Steven van Rijswijk (CRO role)                            | 610,800       | -                        | 610,800                      | 11,600    | 169,000      | 791,400               |\n\nAs recognised in the profit or loss statement of 2020, the expenses for each Executive Board member (active on 31 December 2020), relating to their role on the Executive Board, amount to \u20ac2.0 million for the CEO and \u20ac1.6 million for the CFO. These amounts include deferred elements from previous years, paid out in 2020.\n\nThe following tables (i.e. total direct compensation, pension costs and other emoluments) show the remuneration awarded to individual Executive Board members with respect to the performance years 2020, 2019 and 2018. The 2020 figures reflect a partial year as an Executive Board member for Ralph Hamers. In addition, the figures for Steven van Rijswijk are divided between his two different roles on the Executive Board. The 2019 figures reflect a partial year as an Executive Board member for Tanate Phutrakul. The 2018 and 2019 figures reflect a full year as Executive Board members for Ralph Hamers and Steven van Rijswijk.\n\nAll Executive Board remuneration is paid directly by ING with the exception of director's fees for Tanate Phutrakul as non-executive director at ING Belgium.",

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)\n\nThe primary objective of ING's remuneration principles is to attract, motivate and retain qualified and expert leaders as well as senior staff (including Executive Board members) and other highly qualified staff who have the desired Orange Code values and behaviours, skills and knowledge to deliver on ING's purpose and Think Forward strategy in a sustainable way.\n\nThe remuneration principles are an integral part of ING's strategy and risk profile. They maintain a sustainable balance between short and longterm value creation and build on ING's long -term responsibility towards its employees, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. Our approach to the remuneration principles did not change in 2020.\n\nOur remuneration principles apply to all staff and are embedded in ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework (IRRF) and our people off er (OPO). Introduced in 2020, OPO sets out ING's differentiating offer as an employer in the marketplace and states what we ask of our people in return. It gives guidance to our global people practices, while supporting our Think Forward Strategy. The IRRF and OPO comply with relevant international and local legislation and regulations.\n\n## Our remuneration principles\n\nOur remuneration principles apply to all employees and comprise the following:\n\n## Aligned with business strategy\n\nING's remuneration principles are aligned with the business strategy and company goals.\n\n## Creates long-term value\n\nING's remuneration principles contribute to long -term value creation and support a focus on the long-term interests of its stakeholders, including employees, customers and shareholders.\n\n## Responsible and fair\n\nIn line with our Orange Code values and behaviours, ING acts responsibly and treats staff fairly across the globe.\n\n## Mitigates risk and optimises controls\n\nRisk management is an enabler of long-term value creation. ING ensures its remuneration principles are properly correlated with its risk profile and stakeholder interests.\n\n## Performance driven\n\nING operates a fair, objective and transparent performance management process linked to remuneration to steer and motivate all employees to deliver on its strategic goals, aiming to reward success and prevent rewarding for failure.\n\n## Sustainable\n\nING supports the sustainable recruitment, engagement and retention of all employees.\n\n## Performance management\n\nWe aim to reward for success and avoid rewarding for failure. That is why ING's remuneration approach is strongly linked to a robust and transparent performance management process. Outcomes of performance evaluations (including collective and individual risk assessments) provide input for remuneration. As not all employees are eligible for variable remuneration there is not necessarily a link to financial performance. In the Netherlands, for example the vast majority of the employees do not receive any variable remuneration.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\nStep Up Performance Management is our global performance management approach applicable to the majority of employees. It aims to improve people's individual performance and thereby team performance and ultimately ING's performance. Step Up Performance Management is one of our people practices that help to increase focus, alignment and transparency. We do this through continuous conversations between managers, employees and teams. To support these conversations, there are three formal moments to discuss performance during the year: target setting, mid-year review and year-end evaluation.\n\nThe Step Up Performance Management approach consists of three dimensions:\n\n- \uf0a0 Job: the impact employees have in their daily work on an individual and team level, based on factors such as qualitative job description, dynamic planning and specific selected quantitative priorities.\n- \uf0a0 Orange Code behaviours: how employees do their work and how effective their behaviour is as a profes sional and colleague. We expect all employees to act in line with ING's Orange Code.\n- \uf0a0 Stretch ambitions: at ING, we believe high performance requires stretch and investment (to achieve the stretch). Therefore we ask people to set ambitions beyond their day-to-day role and connect their personal passion, expertise or interest with the long-term success of ING.\n\nAll targets are agreed between the employee and their manager, as well as within management teams, to ensure consistency across the bank. ING uses three labels to evaluate performance: excellent, well done and improvement required.\n\nStep Up Performance Management does not prescribe the targets employees should set. However, the following regulatory requirements apply to specific groups:\n\n- \uf0a0 For employees eligible for variable remuneration, a minimum of 50% non-financial priorities.\n- \uf0a0 For all employees in control functions (Legal, Risk, Finance, Compliance, Audit and Human Resources), no individual financial KPIs are allowed, unless required by local law.\n- \uf0a0 For identified risk takers, risk mitigation measures may lead to a downwards adjustment of the performance outcome and negatively affect variable remuneration (a risk modifier can be applied).\n\n## Total direct compensation\n\nING aims to provide total direct compensation or expected business and individual performance at levels which, on average, are at the median of the markets in which we operate, benchmarked against relevant peer groups. In line with the Dutch Banking Code, the current remuneration levels of the Executive Board are below the median of the peer group introduced with the 2020 EB remuneration policy. This year, remuneration levels for members of the Management Board Banking were also benchmarked against the same peer group as the Executive Board. The Executive Board and the other members of the Management Board Banking are on average below the median. Three members of the Management Board Banking are on or slightly above the median. Due to their ING-specific roles it is difficult to have a good comparison inside and outside of the financial industry in the Netherlands as well as abroad. There are limited comparable positions for these roles. To ensure we adhere to our 2020 EB remuneration policy, we regularly monitor and benchmark salary levels across ING.\n\nFixed remuneration represents a sufficiently high proportion, in line with the level of expertise and skills, and allows a fully flexible variable remuneration award. When no variable remuneration is awarded, the compensation level is still enough for a decent standard of living. Variable remuneration is performance driven, subject to regulatory caps and prevents excessive risk taking, where applicable.\n\n## The comprehensive process around variable remuneration\n\nThe awarding of variable remuneration, where applicable, is based on group, business line and individual performance criteria unless local legislation prescribes otherwise. In all ING countries, we adhere to the applicable variable remuneration caps.\n\nFor Identified Staff (i.e. staff considered to have a material impact on ING's risk profile), at least 40% of variable remuneration is deferred over a period of three to five years with a tiered vesting schedule. Furthermore, at least 50% of variable remuneration is awarded in equity (or equity-linked instruments unless local legislation prescribes otherwise).\n\n## Performance and risk assessment\n\nING applies measures to mitigate risk relating to variable remuneration. Our global remuneration policy takes into consideration risk, capital, liquidity and the likelihood and timing of earnings. Measures include pre-award and post-award risk assessments of variable remuneration.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\nIn 2020, the Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board approved the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model (VRAM) set-up and approach to determine the 2020 discretionary riskadjusted variable remuneration pools.\n\nThe VRAM takes a holistic view of the overall performance of ING across three key dimensions:\n\n- (i) financial,\n- (ii) non-financial, and\n- (iii) risk.\n\nWithin each of these three elements specific criteria are used to measure performance (e.g. profit, return on equity, customer, people, strategy, sustainability as well as financial and non-financial risk).\n\nThe proposal for the variable remuneration pool is prepared by Human Resources, Risk and Finance, and follows the VRAM's step -by-step process and construct including CEO discretion to adjust the proposed variable remuneration pool. The CEO considers several factors when making this decision. This discretion is checked by the Supervisory Board and requires their approval.\n\nThe Management Board Banking reviews the variable remuneration pool on behalf of the Supervisory Board, taking into account the advice of the Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe total variable remuneration pool (for individual and collective variable remuneration), encompasses all employees eligible for variable remuneration globally, including Identified Staff. ING takes a multi-step approach to determine whether to award variable remuneration in a given performance year and the maximum amount of the pool. Within this process, a range of risk elements is assessed at various levels and, where appropriate, risk adjustments are made to the variable remuneration pools.\n\n## Performance hurdles\n\nTo unlock the discretionary variable remuneration pools, both of the following performance hurdles must be met. These are:\n\n- \uf0a0 The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio must be at or above the threshold established by applicable regulations;\n- \uf0a0 The return on equity (underlying RoE) is equal to or higher than the percentage determined at the beginning of each performance year by the Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board. Underlying RoE, in line with the VRAM Policy (as established in PY 2019) and approved by governing bodies, can be adjusted due to one-time charges or infrequent occurrences, such as but not limited to macro-economic events and pandemic events, during a given performance year.\n\nA variable remuneration pool is also separately accrued for staff in control functions and support functions and for those employees subject to a collective variable remuneration plan. The amount is defined by the Management Board Banking and approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Risk adjustments\n\nIn determining the overall size of the variable remuneration pool, a multi-layered, consistent and bankwide approach for risk tests and adjustments is applied to the process, based on an assessment by the CRO.\n\nTo establish appropriate risk-adjusted variable remuneration pools, ex ante risk adjustments are made based on measures used to assess the bank's current and future risks and whether performance sufficiently aligns with risk appetite levels. The risk adjustment assessment includes measurements on 'forward looking' capital, liquidity and non -financial risk, where adjustments are made on deviation from risk appetite.\n\nIn addition, ex post risk adjustments are a key element in the process of determining both final variable remuneration pools and individual awards. Here, the CRO may provide additional input at a more granular level to adjust ING's overall, business line and/or country variable remuneration pools based on their risk management performance.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\nThe ex-ante and/or ex-post risk adjustments require Supervisory Board approval, taking into account the input of the Risk and Finance functions and the advice of the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe final risk adjustment measure lies in the individual perfo rmance assessment itself. An employee's performance is extensively assessed before variable remuneration is proposed and awarded. Every manager carefully assesses the performance delivered by their individual team members on the basis of pre-agreed performance priorities and in line with the Step Up Performance Management framework. In addition, managers have the discretionary power to lower the proposed variable remuneration if risk taking is perceived as inappropriate. In this way, variable remuneration is aligned with any additional risks identified on an individual basis during the performance year.\n\nAdditional risk requirements apply to Identified Staff who are considered risk takers in accordance with CRD IV. These risk requirements set the minimum standards to be met during the performance year. Deviation from these standards may lead to downward adjustment of the variable remuneration, a socalled risk modifier. This process is run independently by the Risk function for which the CRO is ultimately responsible. Within the Executive Board, risk modifiers were applied to the CEO for the performance year 2020. The Supervisory Board, advised by its Risk Committee, is responsible for risk modifiers within the Management Board Banking.\n\nFinally, a post-award risk assessment can be applied. This assessment analyses whether any events or findings occurred that should lead to a downward adjustment of variable remuneration of previous years by applying a holdback (i.e., forfeiture of up to 100% of the awarded, but unvested, variable remuneration) or clawback (surrender of up to 100% of the paid or vested variable remuneration).\n\n## Shareholders' mandate to exceed 100% variable remuneration cap\n\nING's remuneration policies comply with international and local legislation and regulations. Under the Dutch WBFO (which sets various requirements on remuneration), financial institutions are permitted to set a variable remuneration cap higher than 100% (but not higher than 200%) of fixed remuneration for employees outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that the higher cap is approved by shareholders and does not conflict with ING's capital adequacy requirements.\n\nAt the 2017 AGM, shareholders approved to apply an increased maximum percentage of up to 200% for employees outside the EEA for a period of five performance years until end-2021. For 2020, it was applied to zero employees worldwide. At the 2021 AGM, we will ask for a new mandate to apply an increased maximum percentage of up to 200% for employees outside the EEA for a further period of five performance years, from 2022 until 2026. This mandate is rarely used by ING and was applied to zero employees worldwide in 2018 and 2019.\n\n## 2020 specifics\n\nING awards variable remuneration across the global organisation in line with our remuneration principles, global and local legislation and market practices. The awarding of variable remuneration, where applicable, is based on group, business line and individual performance criteria, both financial and non-financial, and comes in the form of discretionary and collective variable remuneration.\n\nCollective variable remuneration is based on collective labour agreements and/or profit sharing schemes that are driven by regulation, law and/or workers council agreements in various countries. Over the past years the total amount of collective variable remuneration has been relatively stable and typically accounted for around 25% of the total amount of variable remuneration.\n\nThe award of discretionary variable remuneration is based on a clear, transparent and verifiable mechanism for measuring performance and applying adjustments for risks (the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model or VRAM). The starting point is an aggregate of the individual target incentive amounts from all eligible employees across the group. The next step is to unlock the discretionary pool based on the results of the performance hurdles. First, the underlying RoE was calculated and this performance hurdle passed. The underlying RoE, in line with the VRAM Policy and approved by governing bodies, has been adjusted for macro-economic and pandemic events during performance year 2020. The CET1 performance hurdle was also calculated and passed. Subsequent to the results of these performance hurdles the discretionary pool was unlocked. This 'discretionary pool' is then subject to a number of adjustments including for financial and non-financial performance and for risk.",

While considerations around staff well-being and the wider societal impact of the pandemic are paramount, these circumstances have led to weaker performance results and this led to a negative adjustment to the discretionary pool. Furthermore, in line with our policy, executive discretion was applied to further adjust the pool amount downwards in light of declining financial performance and recognising broader stakeholder interests. Overall, these adjustments accounted for a downward adjustment of the discretionary pool amount by approximately 26% from target discretionary pool and resulting in approximately 20% decline versus the previous performance year. A differentiated approach was taken in the allocation of the discretionary variable remuneration, with a significantly larger reduction for senior leaders than for junior employees (on average 30% reduction for senior leaders).\n\nThe total actual amount of both discretionary and collective variable remuneration awarded to all eligible employees globally for 2020 was \u20ac314.2 million (\u20ac93.6 million in collective variable remuneration), compared to total staff expenses of \u20ac5,812 million. For 2019, the total amount was \u20ac378.0 million (\u20ac98.0 million in collective variable remuneration) on \u20ac5,755 milli on staff expenses and \u20ac303.1 million (\u20ac93.9 million in collective variable remuneration) out of \u20ac5,420 million in 2018.\n\nIn 2020, two employees -excluding members of the Management Board Banking -were awarded total annual remuneration (including employer pension contributions and excluding severance payments made) of \u20ac1 million or more.",

        "page_content": "- > Works councils\n\n## Works councils\n\nING's works councils are elected by employees to represent and promote their interests and ensure alignment with ING's purpose and strategy. The works councils advise management on important company decisions, such as reorganisations, and provide consent on behalf of employees, for example to make changes to social benefits.\n\nING has local works councils in several countries where we operate, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. The Dutch Central Works Council (COR) represents around 14,000 employees in the Netherlands. ING also has a cross-border European Works Council (EWC), which is consulted when decisions are made that affect employees in multiple countries and cannot be negotiated locally.\n\nLooking back on 2020, it was a challenging year and th e works councils worked closely with ING's management to find solutions for issues impacting employees. Many of these arose from the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent measures that were taken to contain it, not least working from home.\n\n## Central Works Council\n\nThe Central Works Council comprises representatives from each of the six local works councils in the Netherlands, each representing a different employee group. The COR is the overarching body that engages with management on issues that impact all employees in the Netherlands in areas such as diversity, wellbeing, communication, conduct and social benefits.\n\nIn 2020, the COR focused on a number of issues related to working from home. In response to a COR proposal, which recognises the company's responsibility to ensure the health and safety of its workforce, employees received a personal budget of \u20ac1,000 to set up an ergonomically sound workplace at home.\n\nWorking from home can have an impact on colleagues' wellbeing. The division between work and private life is made more complicated and creates a new type of work pressure for both employees and for ING as an employer. The COR strongly advises management to continue paying attention to this topic and to invest in it.\n\nThe importance of communication and staying connected to employees at a time when they are physically distant from ING was also addressed. This became even more significant during the year as working from home added a new dimension to what was already a challenge. In addition, it's vital to keep employees involved in the many changes taking place across the organisation as ING works towards becoming a universal digital bank. The COR finds it important that ING empowers managers and team leads to become better at meeting the changing needs of their teams in this new situation.\n\n## Members of the COR, December 2020\n\nEdward Boeijenga, chairman Arend Nijenhuis, deputy chairman Yvonne Vork, works council support Bouke van den Berg Henny Hey Nienke Kuijlaars-van Bekkum Michiel van Lagen Sofiane Maktouf Marinus Stoffers Marcel de Valk Radboud Vanlerberghe",

It currently has 28 members from 15 ING countries. The EWC meets twice a year with ING's Management Board Banking (MBB) and other business managers to discuss topics of international and significant interest. It aims to be a sounding board for management decisions and bring balance to the decision-making process.\n\nAt the end of 2019, the EWC looked into ways to encourage its members to become more actively involved and make its meetings, presentations and discussions more effective by making them shorter and more frequent. This was put into practice in 2020, when it became clear the Covid-19 pandemic was going to make it impossible to meet in person.\n\nIt forced the EWC to take a pragmatic and flexible approach as it welcomed new members from several countries and held its first-ever online election of a new EWC Select Committee in November 2020. In May and November, both plenary meetings with representatives of the Management Board Banking and several ING business lines also took place online.

Commercial Register of Amsterdam, number 33231073. These Consolidated financial statements, as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020, comprise ING Groep N.V. (the Parent company) and its subsidiaries, together referred to as ING Group. ING Group is a global financial institution with a strong European base, offering a wide range of retail and wholesale banking services to customers in over 40 countries.\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements, as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020, were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Executive Board on 8 March 2021. The General Meeting of Shareholders may decide not to adopt the financial statements, but may not amend these.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of preparation of the Consolidated financial statements\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the relevant articles of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nIFRS as adopted by the EU are IFRS Standards and IFRS Interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) with some limited modifications such as the temporary 'carve -out' from IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' (herein, referred to as IFRS).\n\nUnder the EU carve-out, ING Group applies fair value hedge accounting to portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging). For further information, reference is made to paragraph 1.7.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' of this note and to note 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and there are no significant doubts about the ability of ING Group to continue as a going concern. In 2020 ING Group's capital and liquidity position remained strong despite the Covid-19 impact and ING Group has sufficient buffers to withstand certain adverse scenarios without breaching currently applicable and likely future requirements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and rounded to the nearest million, unless stated otherwise. Amounts may not add up due to rounding.\n\n## 1.2.1 Presentation of Risk management disclosures\n\nTo improve transparency, reduce duplication and present related information in one place, certain disclosures of the nature and extent of risks related to financial instruments required by IFRS 7 'Financial instruments: Disclosures' are included in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report.\n\nThese disclosures are an integral part of ING Group Consolidated financial statements and are indicated in the 'Risk management' section by the symbol (*). Chapters, paragraphs, graphs or tables within the risk management section that are indicated with this symbol in the respective headings or table header are considered to be an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.3 Impact of Covid-19\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, various governments issued programs offering guarantee schemes for borrowers impacted by Covid-19. As at 31 December 2020 ING Group provided approximately EUR 1.5 billion of loans under these programs.\n\nIn Wholesale Banking the main schemes are being offered in the Netherlands (Corporate Finance Guarantee Sc heme ('GO -C')), in France (state -guarantee scheme Bpifrance) and Germany (guaranteed by KWF).",

        "page_content": "- >  1  Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nIn Retail Banking these facilities include in the Netherlands the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme ('BMKB -C') and the small credit facility ('Klein Krediet Corona' or KKC) for self-employed individuals. Similar facilities are offered by ING in other countries, mainly in Belgium and Poland. ING Belgium provided in 2020 loans under the state guarantee scheme GS1 which establishes risk sharing between banks and the government. It applies to new loans to non-financial companies, SME and self-employed persons under certain conditions. ING Bank Poland signed an agreement with BGK (Polish State Development Bank) to support clients with individual guarantee schemes, provided by BGK as a collateral (equivalent to a state guarantee).\n\nLoans that have been originated under the above programs have been recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position of ING Group. Depending on the scheme, the guarantees received are either integral or non-integral to the origination of these loans. Following this, the guarantees are either reflected in the expected credit losses (ECL) associated with these loans or as separate reimbursement asset, respectively. In either case, such guarantees have a similar impact on the statement of profit or loss and both reduce the amount presented as 'addition to loan loss provisions'.\n\nIn November 2020 ING Group announced an initiative with European Investment Bank to lend nearly EUR 800 million on favorable terms to Dutch small and medium-sized enterprises that are affected by the economic impact of Covid-19. Loans originated under this program will be recognized on the statement of financial position of ING Group as from 2021.\n\nGovernments in almost all countries where ING Retail bank is active have adopted measures providing for payment holidays to private individuals and small business loans. As of the end of December 2020, approximately 196 thousand customers were granted payment holidays in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The total exposure of loans for which a payment holiday is granted amounts to EUR 19.4 billion as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe modification of contractual terms of loans subject to payment holiday arrangements does not automatically result in derecognition of the financial assets. Where applicable, the carrying amount of the financial asset has been recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate and a gain or loss was recognized. This did not have a material impact on the profit or loss statement of ING Group.\n\nThe various measures by governments and ING to alleviate the impact of Covid-19 also impacts the classification of assets as forborne. Based on European Banking Authority (EBA) Guidelines, assets that were subject to Covid-19 payment holidays granted before 30 September 2020 were not classified as forborne. As a result, these payment holidays did not automatically trigger recognition of lifetime Expected Credit Loss (ECL). Payment holidays granted that were outside the scope of these Guidelines or granted after 30 September 2020 did trigger the recognition of lifetime ECL. Reference is made to 'Credit risk' paragraph of ' Risk management ' section for further information.\n\nAs a result of the economic effects of Covid-19 estimation uncertainty and level of management judgement increased in 2020 in the areas of impairment assessment of loan loss provisions (including the need for management overlays), non-financial assets and associated companies, and the determination of the fair values of financial assets and liabilities. Reference is made to paragraph 1.5 ' Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions ' for further explanation.\n\nOver the course of 2020 the European Central Bank (ECB) decided on a number of modifications to the terms and conditions of its Targeted Longer-term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) in order to support further the provision of credit to households and firms in the face of the current economic disruption and heightened uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ING  Group has borrowed EUR 59.5 billion under the TLTRO III program during 2020. Reference is made to paragraph 1.6 ' Other Developments ' .\n\n## 1.4 Changes to accounting policies and presentation\n\nING Group has consistently applied its accounting policies to all periods presented in these Consolidated financial statements, except for changes due to the introduction of IFRS 16 'Leases' in 2019. Comparatives were not restated when applying IFRS 16.\n\nFurthermore, ING Group has already early adopted in 2019 the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 1) amendments to IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' . These amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of 2019 or were designated thereafter. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to",

The amendments require certain additional disclosures and have no further impact. Refer to paragraph 1.7.4 of this note and to note 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for more information on the adoption of these amendments.\n\nIn 2020 ING Group presented separately on the face of the Statement of Profit or Loss the following two lines (including comparatives): 'Impairment of associates and joint ventures' and 'Net result o n derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost'. These line s were not presented separately in prior years given the size of the amounts, but were included in 'Share of result from associates and joint ventures' and 'Other income' respectively.\n\n## 1.4.1 Changes in IFRS effective in 2020\n\nThe changes in IFRS that becam e effective in 2020 did not have a significant impact on ING Group's accounting policies, ING Group's results or financial position:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations': Definition of a Business (issued in October 2018);\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: 'Definition of Material' (issued in October 2018); and\n- \u00b7 Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (issued in March 2018).\n\nING Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment in 2020 which has been issued, but is not yet effective.\n\n## 1.4.2 Upcoming changes in IFRS after 2020\n\nThe following published amendments are not mandatory for 2020 and have not been early adopted by ING Group. ING Group is still currently assessing the detailed impact of these amendments. However, the implementation of these amendments is expected to have no significant impact on ING Group's Consolidated financial statements, apart from IBOR Phase 2 amendments, the impact of which is explained below.\n\nThe list of upcoming changes to IFRS, which are applicable for ING Group:\n\n## Effective in 2021:\n\nIn May 2020 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases': 'Covid -19Related Rent Concessions' to provide lessees with an exemption from assessing whether a Covid-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. The amendments, endorsed by the EU, are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020, with early application permitted. Once they become effective for ING Group in 2021, the amendments will not have material impact on ING Group's accounting policies, ING Group's results or financial position. In 2020 ING Group did not receive rent concessions as a lessee. This is why the amendments were not relevant and, hence, not early adopted by ING Group in 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement', IFRS 16 'Leases', IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures': 'IBOR Reform and its Effects on Financial Reporting -Phase 2'. Phase 2 amendments relate mainly to accounting for changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets and liabilities due to the IBOR reform and impact on hedge accounting when an existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced with an alternative risk free rate. Specifically, for ING Group, the main elements of the Phase 2 amendments are that the effective interest rate on debt financial instruments will be adjusted, and hedge accounting will continue on transition to risk free rates, but only to the extent that the modifications made to financial instruments are those necessary to implement IBOR Reform and that the new basis for calculating cash flows is 'economically equivalent' t o the previous basis. When ING Group  applies these amendments, ING Group would avoid recognising modification gains and losses on debt instruments that would otherwise be required in the absence of Phase 2 amendments. In addition, when ING Group applies Phase 2 amendments, ING Group will avoid hedge accounting discontinuations when modifying both hedged items and hedging instruments as a consequence of IBOR reform that would otherwise be required in the absence of Phase 2 amendments. When ING Group applies Phase 2 amendments, certain additional disclosures will need to be provided.\n\nThe Phase 2 amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with early application permitted and have been endorsed by the EU.\n\nING Group did not early adopt Phase 2 amendments in 2020 as Phase 2 reliefs were largely not yet relevant for ING Group. During 2021, ING Group commenced the process of amending contracts",

This is the period when Phase 2 amendments will become relevant (and mandatorily effective) for ING Group.\n\n## Effective in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations': Reference to the Conceptual Framework (issued in May 2020).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment': Proceeds before Intended Use (issued in May 2020).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets':  Onerous Contracts -Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (issued in May 2020).\n- \u00b7 Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 20182020 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 1 'First -time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard', amendments to IFRS 9 'F inancial Instruments' and amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases' (issued in May 2020).\n\nAlthough ING Group is currently assessing the detailed impact of the above amendments, it is expected that they will not have a significant impact on ING Group's accounting policies, ING Group's results or financial position.\n\n## Effective in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements': Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (issued in January 2020).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements': Disclosure of Accounting Policies (issued in February 2021).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors': Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued in February 2021).\n\nAlthough ING Group is currently assessing the detailed impact of the above amendments, it is expected that they will not have a significant impact on ING Group's accounting policies, ING Group's results or financial position.\n\nThe IASB has also issued IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'. The original effective date of IFRS 17 was 1 January 2021, but in June 2020 the IASB has published an Amendment confirming 1 January 2023 as the new effective date. ING Group is currently assessing the detailed impact of IFRS 17.\n\n## 1.5 Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements in the process of applying its accounting policies and to use estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and the amounts of the contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date, as well as reported income and expenses for the year. The actual outcome may differ from these estimates. The process of setting assumptions is subject to internal control procedures and approvals.\n\nING Group has identified areas that require management to make significant judgements and use critical accounting estimates and assumptions based on the information and financial data that may change in future periods. These areas are:\n\n- \u25aa Loan loss provisions (financial assets);\n- \u25aa The determination of the fair values of financial assets and liabilities;\n- \u25aa Impairment assessment of non-financial assets;\n- \u25aa Impairment assessment of an investment in associate;\n- \u25aa Provisions; and\n- \u25aa Accounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO).\n\nIn light of Covid-19 the estimation uncertainty and level of management judgement to determine the loan loss provisions and the fair values of financial assets and liabilities further increased in 2020.\n\nThe negative effects of Covid-19 gave rise to new significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions in 2020: 'Impairment assessment of non -financial assets' where estimates and judgements became more sensitive; and 'Impairment assessment of an investment in associate' where impairment indicators arose for the first time. In addition, ING Group 's participation in 2020 in a new series of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) also led to a new area of significant judgements. Recognition and measurement of provisions remained an area of significant judgement and estimation uncertainty in 2020 consistent with prior years.",

        "page_content": "- >  1  Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nFor further discussion of the significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions in these areas, reference is made to the relevant parts in paragraph 1.7 'Financial instruments ' (specifically 1.7.3 for 'Fair values of financial assets and liabilities' and 1.7.8 ' Impairment of financial assets ') , 1.11 'Investments in associates and joint ventures', 1.13 ' Acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets ' , 1.17 ' Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets ' of this note, section 1.6 'Other developments', 'Accounting for Targeted Longer -Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)' and the applicable notes to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.6 Other developments\n\nDefinition of Default\n\nING Group has historically aligned the Definition of Default for regulatory purposes with the definition of 'credit -impaired' financial assets under IFRS 9 (Stage 3). To comply with new regulat ory technical standards (RTS) and EBA guidelines ING updated its Definition of Default in 1Q 2020. Consequently, ING Group updated this definition also for IFRS 9 purposes. From an accounting perspective, this represents a change in accounting estimate that is applied prospectively. This change had no material impact on ING's expectation for credit losses, but impacted the classification of assets mainly between Stage 2 and Stage 3 resulting in an increase in Stage 3 assets (and mostly a decrease of Stage 2 assets) of approximately EUR 1 billion at the time of updating the definition.\n\nAccounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)\n\nIn 2020 ING Group participated in a new series of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) and repaid outstanding amounts under TLTRO II, reference is made to Note 12 'Deposits from banks' .\n\nING Group considers TLTRO funding provided by the ECB to banks to be on market terms on the basis that the ECB has established a separate market with TLTRO programmes. They have specific terms which are different from other sources of funding available to banks, including those provided by the ECB. Consequently, the rate under TLTRO is considered to be a market conforming rate and TLTRO funding is recognized fully as a financial liability.\n\nING interprets the whole rate set by the ECB under TLTRO as a floating rate on the financial liability, being the market rate for each specific period in time. This results in discrete rates for discrete interest periods over the life of TLTRO. The change in the applicable rate between interest periods is seen as a change in the floating rate and is accounted for prospectively. Similarly, if the ECB\n\nannounces changes in the rate for the amounts already drawn under the existing TLTRO, then such changes also represent a change in a floating rate. Following this, such changes lead to the recognition of an increased interest in the relevant period of life of the exposure, rather than by the recognition of an immediate modification gain or loss at the moment of the change of terms by the ECB.\n\nFurthermore, the change in the TLTRO rate driven by changes in expectations of meeting the targets is also seen as a change in the floating rate. However, in this case, the effective interest rate is updated not only prospectively, but also partially retrospectively. As a result, the effect of the revised effective interest rate for the period that already passed until the moment when the change in expectations occurs, is recognised as a catch up adjustment in P&L. This change occurs only when ING Group has a reasonable expectation that the lending targets will be met.\n\nING Group views 'reasonable expectation' in case of TLTRO funding as a high hurdle. This is the moment when it becomes highly probable, i.e. the probability of meeting the lending targets is substantially greater than the probability that it will not. As a result, if interest income is recognised during the period based on the expectation of meeting the targets, there should be only a limited possibility that the interest may need to be reversed in future periods.\n\nReference is made to note 12 'Deposits from banks' and to note 20 'Net interest income' for the presentation of ING Group 's participation in TLTRO programmes .\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nSignificant management judgement is exercised in determining the accounting treatment of TLTRO transactions. In particular, ING Group applied judgement in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing and concluding that in ING Group's view the rate under TLTRO is considered to be a market conforming rate and, hence, accounting for TLTRO in accordance with IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 selecting accounting policies regarding the calculation of the effective interest rate under TLTRO, including treatment of changes in expectations of meeting the lending targets;\n- \u00b7 defining the moment when ING Group has a reasonable expectation of meeting the targets;",

Changes in these estimations may lead to changes in the amount of interest recognized on TLTRO transactions.\n\nING Group continuously monitors the actual and forecasted development of eligible loans under TLTRO programmes to assess the appropriate interest recognition in the statement of profit or loss and to minimise the risk of potential interest reversals due to the use of outdated or incorrect assumptions.\n\n## 1.7 Financial instruments\n\n## 1.7.1 Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments\n\n## Recognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognised in the balance sheet when ING Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. For a regular way purchase or sale of a financial asset, trade date and settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where ING Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. If ING Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, it derecognises the financial asset if it no longer has control over the asset. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial asset that has been extinguished and the consideration received is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Recognition of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised on the date that the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## 1.7.2 Classification and measurement of financial instruments\n\n## Financial assets\n\nING Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u25aa those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI, or through profit or loss); and\n- \u25aa those to be measured at amortised cost (AC).\n\nAt initial recognition, ING Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) are expensed in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets - Debt instruments\n\nThe classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows at initial recognition.\n\n## Business models\n\nBusiness models are classified as Hold to Collect (HtC), Hold to Collect and Sell (HtC&S) or Other depending on how a portfolio of financial instruments as a whole is managed. ING Group's business models are based on the existing management structure of the bank, and refined based on an analysis of how businesses are evaluated and reported, how their specific business risks are managed and on historic and expected future sales. Sales are permissible in a HtC business model when these are due to an increase in credit risk, take place close to the maturity date (where the proceeds from the sales approximate the collection of the remaining contractual cash flows), are insignificant in value (both individually and in aggregate) or are infrequent.",

Interest includes consideration for the time value of money, credit risk and also consideration for liquidity risk and costs associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time. In addition, interest can include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are SPPI.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, ING Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, terms such as the following are considered, with an example of an SPPI failure for each consideration:\n\n- \u25aa prepayment terms. For example a prepayment of an outstanding principal amount plus a penalty which is not capped to three or six months of interest;\n- \u25aa leverage features, which increase the variability of the contractual cash flows with the result that they do not have the economic characteristics of interest. An example is a Libor contract with a multiplier;\n- \u25aa terms that limit ING Group 's claim to cash flows from specified assets - e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements. This could be the case if payments of principal and interest are met solely by the cash flows generated by the underlying asset, for example instances in real estate, shipping and aviation financing;  and\n- \u25aa features that modify consideration of the time value of money. These are contracts with for example an interest rate which is reset every month to a one-year rate. ING Group performs either a qualitative or quantitative benchmark test on a financial asset with a modified time value of money element. A qualitative test is performed when it is clear with little or no analysis whether the contractual cash flows solely represent SPPI.\n\nBased on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows, there are three measurement categories into which ING Group classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- \u25aa Amortised Cost (AC):\n\nDebt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows under a HtC business model where those cash flows represent SPPI are measured at AC. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the EIR method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n- \u25aa FVOCI:\n\nDebt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets under a HtC&S business model, where the assets' cash flows represent SPPI, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and presented in Investment income or Other income, based on the specific characteristics of the business model. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the EIR method. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n- \u25aa FVPL:\n\nDebt instruments that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. This includes debt instruments that are held-for-trading (presented separately as Trading assets) and all other debt instruments that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI (presented separately as Mandatorily at FVPL). ING Group may in some cases, on initial recognition, irrevocably designate a financial asset as classified and measured at FVPL. This is the case where doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise on assets measured at AC or FVOCI. Fair value movements on trading securities, trading loans and deposits (mainly reverse repo's) are presented fully within valuation result and net trading income, this also includes interest. The interest arising on financial assets designated as at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented within Interest income or Interest expense in the period in which it arises. The interest arising on a debt instrument that is part of a hedge relationship, but not subject to hedge accounting, is recognised in profit or loss and presented within Interest income or Interest expense in the period in which it arises.",

Such changes in business models are expected to be very infrequent. There have been no reclassifications during the reporting period.\n\n## Financial assets - Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments are measured at fair value. ING Group applies the fair value through OCI option to investments which are considered strategic, consisting of investments that add value to ING Group's core banking activities.\n\nThere is no subsequent recycling of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of investments if elected to be classified and measured as FVOCI. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as Investment income when I NG Group's right to receive payments is established. Impairment requirements are not applicable to equity investments classified and measured as FVOCI. However, the cumulative gain or loss is transferred within equity to retained earnings on derecognition of such equity instruments.\n\nOther remaining equity investments are measured at FVPL. All changes in the fair value are recognised in Valuation result and Net trading income in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at AC, except for financial guarantee contracts, derivatives and liabilities designated at FVPL. Financial liabilities classified and measured at FVPL are presented as follows:\n\n- \u25aa the amount of change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in own credit risk of the liability designated at FVPL is presented in OCI. Upon derecognition this Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) impact does not recycle from OCI to profit or loss; and\n- \u25aa the remai ning amount of change in the fair value is presented in profit or loss in 'Valuation results and net trading income'. Interest on financial liabilities at FVPL is also recognised in the valuation result, except for items voluntarily designated as FVPL for which interest is presented within 'Other interest income (expense).\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires ING Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due\n\nin accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Such a contract is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the amount determined in accordance with impairment provisions of IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' (see section 'Impairment of financial assets') and (b) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition principle of IFRS 15 'Revenue from co ntracts with customers'.\n\n## 1.7.3 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if there is a difference between the transaction price and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based on a valuation technique that uses significant unobserva ble inputs, the entire day one difference (a 'Day One profit or loss') is deferred and recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures or until the observability changes. In all other cases, ING Group recognises the difference as a gain or loss at inception.\n\nSubsequently, except for financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, all the other financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It assumes that market participants would use and take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability when pricing the asset or liability. Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on unadjusted quoted market prices where available. Such quoted market prices are primarily obtained from exchange prices for listed financial instruments. Where an exchange price is not available, quoted prices in an active market may be obtained from independent market vendors, brokers, or market makers. In general, positions are valued at the bid price for a long position and at the offer price for a short position or are valued at the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. In some cases where positions are marked at mid-market prices, a fair value adjustment is calculated.",

        "page_content": "- >  1  Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nFor certain financial assets and liabilities, quoted market prices are not available. For such instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These range from discounting of cash flows to various valuation models, where relevant pricing factors including the market price of underlying reference instruments, market parameters (volatilities, correlations and credit ratings), and customer behaviour are taken into account. ING Group maximises the use of market observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs in determining the fair value. It can be subjective dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. All valuation techniques used are subject to internal review and approval. Most data used in these valuation techniques are validated on a daily basis when possible.\n\nWhen a group of financial assets and liabilities are managed on the basis of their net risk exposures, the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities are measured on a net portfolio level.\n\nTo include credit risk in fair value, ING Group applies both Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVA, DVA, also known as Bilateral Valuation Adjustments or BVA). Own issued debt and structured notes that are designated at FVPL ar e adjusted for ING Group's own credit risk by means of a DVA. Additionally, derivatives valued at fair value are adjusted for credit risk by a BVA. The BVA is of a bilateral nature as both the credit risk on the counterparty (CVA) as well as the credit risk on ING Group (DVA) are included in the adjustment. All input data that is used in the determination of the BVA is based on market implied data. Additionally, wrong-way risk (when exposure to a counterparty is increasing and the credit quality of that counterparty deteriorates) and right-way risk (when exposure to a counterparty is increasing and the credit quality of that counterparty improves) are taken into account in the measurement of the valuation adjustment.\n\nTo include the funding risk, ING Group applies an additional 'Funding Valuation Adjustment' (FVA) to the uncollateralised derivatives based on the market price of funding liquidity.\n\nING Group also applies to certain positions other valuation adjustments to arrive at the fair value: BidOffer adjustments, Model Risk Adjustments and Collateral Valuation Adjustments (CollVA).\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nEven if market prices are available, when markets are less liquid there may be a range of prices for the same security from different price sources. Selecting the most appropriate price requires judgement and could result in different estimates of fair value.\n\nValuation techniques are subjective in nature and significant judgement is involved in establishing fair values for certain financial assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques involve various assumptions regarding pricing factors. The use of different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of fair value.\n\nPrice testing is performed to assess whether the process of valuation has led to an appropriate fair value of the position and to an appropriate reflection of these valuations in the statement of profit or loss. Price testing is performed to minimise the potential risks for economic losses due to incorrect or misused models.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic impacted the global financial markets in 2020. In the beginning of 2020, ING Group observed large volatility in the market resulting in widened spreads, markets distortion and illiquidity in some specific markets which has stressed ING Group 's valuation processes and movements in level classifications. The volatility in the market has stabilised in the course of 2020 and has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. Financial Assets and Liabilities, including Level 3, continued to be valued using agreed methodologies and ING Group continued to limit the unobservable input to arrive at the most appropriate Fair Market value.\n\nReference is made to note 3 8 'Fair value of assets and liabilities' and to ' Market risk ' paragraph in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report for the basis of the determination of the fair value of financial instruments and related sensitivities.\n\n## 1.7.4 Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including market transactions and valuation techniques (such as discounted",

All derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Fair value movements on derivatives are presented in profit or loss in Valuation result and net trading income, except for derivatives in either a formal hedge relationship and so-called economic hedges that are not in a formal hedge accounting relationship where a component is presented separately in interest result in line with ING Group's risk management strategy.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from financial liabilities and other non-financial contracts and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if:\n\n- a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;\n- b) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and\n- c) the combined instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in profit or loss.\n\nIf an embedded derivative is separated, the host contract is accounted for as a similar free-standing contract.\n\nThe method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. ING Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedge), hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction (cash flow hedge), or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way provided certain criteria are met.\n\nAt the inception of the transaction ING Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, its risk management objective, together with the methods selected to assess hedge effectiveness. ING Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\nING Group applies fair value hedge accounting to portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging) under the EU carve-out. The EU carve-out macro hedging enables a group of derivatives (or proportions) to be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument and removes some of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting. ING Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging) under the EU carve-out to its retail operations. The net exposures of retail funding (savings and current accounts) and retail lending (mortgages) are hedged. The hedging activities are designated under a portfolio fair value hedge on the mortgages. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, together with the fair value adjustment on the mortgages (hedged items) insofar as attributable to interest rate risk (the hedged risk).\n\nING Group applies also macro cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the variability in future cash flows of non-trading assets and liabilities due to the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The designated hedged items are floating rated assets or liabilities, such as floating rate mortgages and corporate loans. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, together with fair value adjustments to the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is, in the case of interest bearing instruments, amortised through the statement of profit or loss over the remaining term of the original hedge or recognised directly when the hedged item is derecognised. For non-interest bearing instruments, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is recognised in the statement of profit or loss only when the hedged item is derecognised.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in the Other Comprehensive Income are recycled to the statement of profit or loss in the periods in which the hedged item affects net result.

When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the Other Comprehensive Income is transferred immediately to the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income and the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in the Other Comprehensive Income are included in the statement of profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed.\n\nIBOR Transition - specific policies applicable from 1 January 2019 for hedges directly affected by IBOR reform\n\nAs further explained in the 'IBOR transition' paragraph in the ' Risk management ' section , the financial markets are going through a significant reform of interbank offered rates (IBOR) and financial institutions are obligated to implement a replacement of major interest rate reference rates. This process is at different stages, and is progressing at different speeds, across several major currencies.\n\nGiven that IBOR reform may have various accounting implications, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has undertaken a two phase project. Phase 1 addresses those issues that affect financial reporting before the replacement of an existing benchmark (Phase 1 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2019). Phase 2 focuses on issues that may affect financial reporting when the existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced Phase 2 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2020.\n\nIn 2019, ING Group early adopted the Phase 1 amendments to IFRS which allowed ING Group to apply a set of temporary exceptions to continue hedge accounting even when there is uncertainty about contractual cash flows arising from the reform. Under these temporary exceptions, interbank offered\n\nrates are assumed to continue unaltered for the purposes of hedge accounting until such time as the uncertainty is resolved.\n\nMore specifically, the following temporary reliefs are part of the Phase 1 amendments:\n\n- \u25aa Highly probable requirement for cash flow hedges When determining whether a forecast transaction is highly probable, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n- \u25aa Prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness When performing the prospective assessment it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n- \u25aa Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness When performing the retrospective assessment hedges are allowed to pass the assessment even if actual results are outside the 80-125% range, during the period of uncertainty arising from the IBOR reform.\n- \u25aa Designation of a component of an item as a hedged item For hedges of the benchmark component of interest rate risk affected by the reform, the separately identifiable requirement only needs to be demonstrated at the inception of such hedging relationships (including macro hedges).\n\nThe amendments are relevant given that ING Group hedges and applies hedge accounting to benchmark interest rate exposure part of IBOR reform. Hedging instruments and most of hedged items continue to be indexed by the IBOR benchmark rates. Therefore, there is still uncertainty in 2020 over the timing and the amount of the replacement rate cash flows and, thus, temporary exceptions under Phase 1 continued to be relevant for ING Group in 2020. ING Group will cease to apply the amendments when this uncertainty is no longer present or when the hedging relationship is discontinued. Reference is made to n ote 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for the disclosures relating to the application of the amendments as part of Phase 1.\n\nIn 2020 ING Group did not early adopt Phase 2 amendments. Reference is made to paragraph 1.4.2 'Upcoming changes in IFRS after 2020' of this note.",

Non-trading derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value taken to the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 1.7.5 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported, in the statement of financial position when ING Group has a current legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Offsetting is applied to certain interest rate swaps for which the services of a central clearing house are used.\n\n## 1.7.6 Repurchase transactions and reverse repurchase transactions\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos), securities lending and similar agreements continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. The counterparty liability is measured at FVPL (designated) and included in Other financial liabilities at FVPL if the asset is measured at FVPL. Otherwise, the counterparty liability is included in Deposits from banks, Customer deposits, or Trading, as appropriate.\n\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), securities borrowings and similar agreements are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. The consideration paid to purchase securities is recognised as Loans and advances to customers, Loans and advances to banks, Other financial assets at FVPL or Trading assets, as appropriate. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and amortised over the life of the agreement using the effective interest method for instruments that are not measured at FVPL.\n\n## 1.7.7 Credit risk management classification and maximum credit risk exposure\n\nCredit risk management disclosures are provided in the 'Credit risk' paragraph 'Credit risk categories' of the 'Risk management' section in the Annual Report.\n\nThe maximum credit risk exposure for items in the statement of financial position is generally the carrying value for the relevant financial assets. For the off-balance sheet items the maximum credit exposure is the maximum amount that could be required to be paid. Reference is made to Note 44 'Contingent liabilities and commitments' for these off -balance sheet items. Collateral received is not taken into account when determining the maximum credit risk exposure.\n\nThe manner in which ING Group manages credit risk and determines credit risk exposures for that purpose is explained in the ' Credit risk ' paragraph 'Credit Risk Appetite and Concentration Risk Framework' of the 'Risk management' section in the Annual Report.\n\n## 1.7.8 Impairment of financial assets\n\nAn Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied to financial assets accounted for at AC or FVOCI such as loans, debt securities and lease receivables, as well as off-balance sheet items such as undrawn loan commitments, certain financial guarantees, and undrawn committed revolving credit facilities. Under the ECL model ING Group calculates the expected credit losses (ECL) by considering on a discounted basis the cash shortfall it would incur in case of a default and multiplying the shortfall by the probability of a default occurring. The ECL is the sum of the probability-weighted outcomes. The ECL estimates are unbiased and include reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecast s of future economic conditions. ING Group's approach leverages the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) models that are used for regulatory purposes. Adjustments are applied to make these models suitable for determining ECL. ECL is recognised on the balance sheet as loan loss provisions (LLP).\n\n## Three stage approach\n\nFinancial assets are classified in one of the below three Stages at each reporting date. A financial asset can move between Stages during its lifetime. The Stages are based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition and defined as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Stage 1\n- Financial assets that have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (i.e. no Stage 2 or 3 triggers apply). Assets are classified as Stage 1 upon initial recognition (with the exception of purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets) and ECL is determined by the probability that a default occurs in the next 12 months (12 months ECL);\n- \u25aa Stage 2",

For assets in Stage 2 ECL reflects an estimate on the credit losses over the remaining maturity of the asset (lifetime ECL); or\n\n- \u25aa Stage 3\n\nFinancial assets that are credit-impaired. Also for these assets ECL is determined over the remaining maturity of the asset.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nING Group established a framework, incorporating quantitative and qualitative indicators, to identify and assess significant increases in credit risk (SICR). This is used to determine the appropriate ECL Stage for each financial asset.\n\nThe main determinate of SICR is a quantitative test, whereby the lifetime Probability of Default (PD) of an asset at each reporting date is compared against its lifetime PD determined at the date of initial recognition. If the delta is above pre-defined absolute or relative thresholds the item is considered to have experienced a SICR. Consequently, the item moves from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (unless the item is credit-impaired). In these instances, items are no longer assigned a 12 month ECL and instead are assigned a lifetime ECL. Items can return to Stage 1 if there is sufficient evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nING Group also relies on a number of qualitative indicators to identify and assess SICR. These include:\n\n- \u25aa Forbearance status;\n- \u25aa Watch List status. Loans on the Watch List are individually assessed for Stage 2 classification;\n- \u25aa Intensive care management;\n- \u25aa Substandard Internal rating; and\n- \u25aa Arrears status.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets (Stage 3)\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for credit-impairment at each reporting date and more frequently when circumstances warrant further assessment. Evidence of credit-impairment includes arrears of over 90 days on any material credit obligation, indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulty, a breach of contract, bankruptcy or distressed restructuring.\n\nAn asset (other than a POCI asset) that is in Stage 3 will move back to Stage 2 when, as at the reporting date, it is no longer considered to be credit-impaired. The asset will migrate back to Stage 1 when its credit risk at the reporting date is no longer considered to have increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nThe definition of credit-impaired under IFRS 9 (Stage 3) is aligned with the definition of default used by ING Group for internal risk management purposes, which is also the definition used for regulatory purposes.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios\n\nING Group has established a quarterly process whereby forward-looking macroeconomics scenarios and probability weightings are developed for the purpose of ECL. ING Group applies data predominantly from a leading service provider (Oxford Economics (OE))  enriched with the internal ING Group view. A baseline, up-scenario and a down-scenario are determined to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted ECL amount. As a baseline scenario, ING Group applies the market-neutral view combining consensus forecasts for economic variables such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, house prices, commodity prices, and short-term interest rates. Applying market consensus in the baseline scenario ensures unbiased estimates of the expected credit losses.\n\nThe alternative scenarios are based on observed forecast errors in the past, adjusted for the risks affecting the economy today and the forecast horizon. The probabilities assigned are based on the likelihoods of observing the three scenarios and are derived from confidence intervals on a probability distribution. The forecasts for the economic variables are adjusted on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nING Group applies a collective assessment method to measure ECL for Stage 1, Stage 2, and certain Stage 3 assets. Other credit-impaired assets subject to ECL measurement apply the individual assessment method.\n\n## Collectively assessed assets (Stages 1 to 3)\n\nFor collective assessed assets, ING Group applies a model-based approach. ECL is determined by, expressed simplistically, multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), adjusted for the time value of money.

These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by being indicative of the debtors' ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated and the loss in case the debtor is not able to pay all amounts due.\n\nFor Stage 3 assets the PD equals 100% and the LGD and EAD represent a lifetime view of the losses based on characteristics of defaulted facilities.\n\nFor the purpose of ECL, ING Group 's expected credit loss models (PD, LGD, EAD) used for regulatory purposes have been adjusted. These adjustments include removing embedded prudential conservatism (such as floors) and converted through-the-cycle estimates to point-in-time estimates. The models assess ECL on the basis of forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts and other inputs. For most financial assets, the expected life is limited to the remaining maturity. For overdrafts and certain revolving credit facilities, such as credit cards, the maturity is estimated based on historical data as these do not have a fixed term or repayment schedule.\n\n## Individually assessed assets (Stage 3)\n\nING Group estimates ECL for individually significant credit-impaired financial assets within Stage 3 on an individual basis. ECL for these Individually assessed assets are determined using the discounted expected future cash flow method. To determine expected future cash flows, one or more scenarios are used. Each scenario is analysed based on the probability of occurrence and include forward looking information.\n\nIn determining the scenarios, all relevant factors impacting the future cash flows are taken into account. These include expected developments in credit quality, business and economic forecasts, and estimates of if/when recoveries will occur taking into account ING Group 's restructuring/recovery strategy.\n\nThe best estimate of ECL is calculated as the weighted-average of the shortfall (gross carrying amount minus discounted expected future cash flow using the original EIR) per scenario, based on best estimates of expected future cash flows. Recoveries can arise from, among others, repayment of the loan, collateral recovery and the sale of the asset. Cash flows from collateral and other credit\n\nenhancements are included in the measurement of ECL of the related financial asset when it is part of or integral to the contractual terms of the financial asset and the credit enhancement is not recognised separately. For the individual assessment, with granular (company or asset-specific) scenarios, specific factors can have a larger impact on the future cash flows than macroeconomic factors.\n\nWhen a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest is no longer recognised based on the accrual income based on the gross carrying amount of the asset. Rather, interest income is calculated by applying the original EIR to the AC of the asset, which is the gross carrying amount less the related loan loss provision.\n\n## Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) assets\n\nPOCI assets are financial assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. Impairment on a POCI asset is determined based on lifetime ECL from initial recognition. POCI assets are recognised initially at an amount net of LLP and are measured at AC using a credit-adjusted effective interest rate. In subsequent periods any changes to the estimated lifetime ECL are recognised in profit or loss. Favourable changes are recognised as an impairment gain even if the lifetime ECL at the reporting date is lower than the estimated lifetime ECL at origination.\n\n## Modifications\n\nIn certain circumstances ING Group grants borrowers postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments on a temporary period of time to maximise collection opportunities, and if possible, avoid default, foreclosure, or repossession. When such postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments is executed based on credit concerns it is also referred to as forbearance (refer to the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report for more details). In such cases, the net present value of the postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments is taken into account in the determination of the appropriate level of ECL. If the forbearance results in a substantial modification of the terms of the loan, the original loan is derecognised and a new loan is recognised at fair value at the modification date. ING Group determines whether there has been a substantial modification using both quantitative and qualitative factors.",

The following events can lead to a write-off:\n\n- \u25aa After a restructuring has been completed and there is a high improbability of recovery of part of the remaining loan exposure (including partial debt forgiveness);\n- \u25aa In a bankruptcy liquidation scenario;\n- \u25aa After divestment or sale of a credit facility at a discount;\n- \u25aa Upon conversion of a credit facility into equity; or\n- \u25aa ING Group releases a legal (monetary) claim it has on its customer.\n\nWhen a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related loan loss provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nDebt forgiveness (or debt settlement) involves write-off but additionally involves the forgiveness of a legal obligation, in whole or in part. This means that ING Group forfeits the legal right to recover the debt. As a result, the financial asset needs to be derecognised. Distinction is made in situations where ING Group ends the relationship with the client and situations where ING Group (partially) continues the financing of the client.\n\n## Presentation of ECL\n\nECL for financial assets measured at AC are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt instruments at FVOCI, the ECL is recognised in OCI, instead of deducted the carrying amount of the asset. ECL also reflects any credit losses related to the portion of the loan commitment that is expected to be drawn down over the remaining life of the instrument. The ECL on issued financial guarantee contracts, in scope of IFRS 9 and not measured at FVPL, are recognised as liabilities and presented in Other provisions. ECL are presented in profit or loss in Addition to loan loss provision.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nConsiderable management judgement is exercised in determining the amount of LLP for financial assets assessed on both a collective and an individual basis. The need for management judgement has increased even further due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, this judgement requires ING\n\nGroup to make various assumptions about the risk of default, the credit loss rates in case of a default and expected future cash flows. These assumptions are based on a combination of ING Group's past history, existing market conditions and forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Changes in these assumptions may lead to changes in the LLP over time. Given they are subjective and complex in nature, and because the LLP and the underlying exposures subject to ECL are material, these assumptions are considered critical accounting assumptions. The sensitivity of these assumptions is assessed in the credit risk section of the 'Risk Management' section in the Annual Report.\n\n## The use of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in both collective and individual impairment assessments\n\nForward-looking macroeconomic scenarios are uncertain in nature. The process ING Group follows involves two internal groups, the Macroeconomics Scenarios Team and the Macroeconomics Scenarios Expert Panel. The latter team consists of senior management representatives from the Business, Risk and Finance. These groups review inputs obtained from a third party provider and subject these to internal expert challenge to ensure the inputs used in the models reflect ING Group 's view on the macro economy. The use of alternate forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios can produce significantly different estimates of ECL. This is demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis in the 'Risk Management' se ction of the Annual Report, where the un-weighted ECL under each of the three scenarios for some significant portfolios is disclosed. The uncertainty around the expected macroeconomic recovery once Covid-19 induced lockdowns are lifted increased the judgement necessary in using macroeconomic scenarios. Furthermore, the specific nature of the Covid-19 crisis, which leads to a time lag between the effects of macroeconomic outlooks on model produced ECL and observed defaults, has further increased the judgements required in the use of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in 2020.\n\n## The probability weights applied to each of the three scenarios\n\nThis is a management judgement that ultimately requires estimation and consideration of the range of possibilities. This ensures a consensus view on the likelihood of each scenario materialising is appropriately reflected in the weights applied by ING Group for collectively assessed ECL. The sensitivity analysis in the 'Risk Management' section of the Ann ual Report discloses these weights used.",

        "page_content": "- >  1  Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\n## The criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly, ING Group considers reasonable and supportable information to compare the risk of default occurring at reporting date with the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition of the financial asset. Whilst judgement is required in applying a PD rating to each financial asset, there is significant judgement used in determining the Stage allocation PD banding thresholds. The process of comparing a financial asset's PD with the PD banding thresholds determines its ECL Stage. Assets in Stage 1 are allocated a 12 month ECL, and those in Stage 2 are allocated a lifetime ECL, and the difference is often significant. As such, the judgement made in assigning financial asset PDs and the PD banding thresholds constitute a significant judgement. Analysis of the sensitivity associated with the assessment of significant inc rease in credit risk is presented in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report. During 2020 ING Group provided many customers with payment holidays. Traditional risk drivers in models used to determine LLP that are based on customers' payment beha viour may be ineffective for these assets, because customers with payment holidays are not required to make regular material payment and limited (if any) additional information is available. Hence, judgement was required to appropriately reflect the effect of payment holidays on LLP.\n\n## The definition of default\n\nJudgement is exercised in management's evaluation of whether there is objective evidence that larger exposures are credit-impaired. Management judgement is required in assessing evidence of credit-impairment.\n\n## Impact from COVID-19 -management overlays and management adjustments\n\nThe increased uncertainty around ECL arising from Covid-19 in the use of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and determining significant increases in credit risk resulted in Covid-19 related management overlays and adjustments to the model-based ECL. The management adjustment related to payment holidays and management overlay related to time lag in expected defaults are EUR 638 million in total. Reference is made t o the Credit risk paragraph in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report .\n\n## 1.8 Consolidation\n\nING Group comprises ING Groep N.V. (the Parent Company), ING Bank N.V. and all other subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by ING Groep N.V. Control exists if ING Groep N.V. is exposed or has rights to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through the power over the investee. Control is usually achieved through situations including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u25aa Ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than half of the voting power;\n- \u25aa Ability to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors;\n- \u25aa Power to govern operating and financial policies under statute or agreement; and\n- \u25aa Power over more than half of the voting rights through an agreement with other investors.\n\nThe existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether ING Group controls another entity.\n\nFor interests in structured entities, the existence of control requires judgement as these entities are designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. This judgement includes, for example, the involvement in the design of the structured entity, contractual arrangements that give rights to direct the structured entities relevant activities and commitment to ensure that the structured entity operates as designed.\n\nA list of principal subsidiaries is included in Note 47 'Principal subsidiaries'.\n\nA list containing the information referred to in Section 379 (1), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code has been filed with the office of the Commercial Register of Amsterdam, in accordance with Section 379 (5), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe results of the operations and the net assets of subsidiaries are included in the statement of profit or loss and the statement of financial position from the date control is obtained until the date control is lost. On disposal, the difference between the sales proceeds, net of directly attributable transaction costs, and the net assets is included in net result.\n\nA subsidiary which ING Group has agreed to sell but is still legally owned by ING Group may still be controlled by ING Group at the balance sheet date and therefore, still be included in the",

Where necessary, the accounting policies used by subsidiaries are changed to ensure consistency with group policies. In general, the reporting dates of subsidiaries are the same as the reporting date of ING Groep N.V.\n\nING Groep N.V. and its Dutch group companies are subject to legal restrictions regarding the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholders. The Dutch Civil Code contains the restriction that dividends can only be paid up to an amount equal to the excess of the company's own funds over the sum of the paid-up capital and reserves required by law. Certain Group companies are also subject to other restrictions in certain countries, in addition to the restrictions on the amount of funds that may be transferred in the form of dividends, or otherwise, to the parent company.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the restrictions in respect of minimum capital requirements that are imposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries operate, other limitations exist in certain countries.\n\n## 1.9 Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a distinguishable component of ING Group, engaged in providing products or services, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board of ING Group and the Management Board Banking (together the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess its performance. A geographical area is a distinguishable component of ING Group engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.\n\nThe CODM examines ING Group's performance both by line of business and geographic perspective and has identified five reportable segments by line of business and six by geographical area. The geographical analyses are based on the location of the office from which the transactions are originated.\n\n## 1.10 Foreign currency translation\n\nFunctional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of ING Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is ING Group ' s presentation currency.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Exchange rate differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as part of qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nExchange rate differences on non-monetary items, measured at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Non-monetary items are retranslated at the date the fair value is determined. Exchange rate differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through other comprehensive income  are included in other comprehensive income and get accumulated in the revaluation reserve in equity.\n\nExchange rate differences in the statement of profit or loss are generally included in 'Valuation results and net trading income'. Reference is made to Note 22 'Valuation results and net trading income', which discloses the amounts included in the statement of profit or loss. Exchange rate differences relating to the disposal of debt and FVPL equity securities are considered to be an inherent part of the capital gains and losses recognised in Investment income. As mentioned below, in Group companies relating to the disposals of group companies, any exchange rate difference deferred in equity is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 'Result on disposal of group companies'. Reference is also made to Note 19 'Equity', which discloses the amounts included in the statement of profit or loss.",

When a foreign operation is sold, the corresponding exchange rate differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 1.11 Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence is the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies of the investee. It generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or through situations including, but not limited to one or more of the following:\n\n- \u25aa Representation on the board of directors;\n- \u25aa Participation in the policymaking process; and\n- \u25aa Interchange of managerial personnel.\n\nJoint ventures are entities over which ING Group has joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement or entity, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint control means\n\nthat no party to the agreement is able to act unilaterally to control the activity of the entity. The parties to the agreement must act together to control the entity and therefore exercise the joint control.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\nING Group's investment in associates and joint ventures (net of any accumulated impairment loss) includes goodwill identified on acquisition. ING Group 's share of its associates and joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of postacquisition changes in reserves is recognised in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the ING Group's share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any long-term interests in the associate like uncollateralised loans that are neither planned nor likely to be settled in the foreseeable future, ING Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between ING Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of ING Group's interest in the associates and joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless they provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by ING Group.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in associates and joint ventures is not tested separately for impairment, but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the investment. Reversal of impairment is considered when the indicators of impairment no longer exist and the recoverable amount has improved above the carrying amount. The reversal of impairment cannot exceed the original impairment loss.",

The cost of the assets is depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally as follows: for data processing equipment two to five years, and four to ten years for fixtures and fittings. Expenditure incurred on maintenance and repairs is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred. Expenditure incurred on major improvements is capitalised and depreciated.\n\n## Disposals of property and equipment\n\nThe difference between the proceeds on disposal and net carrying value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss under Other income.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nIFRS 16 'Leases' Accounting policies applied from 1 January 2019 ING Group as the lessee\n\nA lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a corresponding liability representing its obligation to make lease payments at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by ING Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the repayment of the liability and finance cost. The finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight -line basis.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u25aa Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u25aa Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u25aa Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u25aa The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u25aa Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nThe most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the assessment of impairment of the investment in TMB which involves estimations of value in use.\n\nManagement's best estimate of TMB's expected future earnings are based on forecasts derived from broker consensus over the short to medium term and TMB observable targets for steady state earnings into perpetuity. A capital maintenance charge is applied, w hich is management's forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in order for TMB to meet target regulatory requirements over the forecast period. Both of these factors are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nKey assumptions used in estimating TMB's value in use and the sensitivity of the value in use calculations to different assumptions are described in Note 8 'Investments in associates and joint ventures'.\n\n## 1.12 Property and equipment\n\n## Property in own use\n\nLand and buildings held for own use are stated at fair value at the balance sheet date. Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land and buildings held for own use are credited to the revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity. Decrease s in the carrying amount that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against the revaluation reserve directly in equity; all other decreases are charged to the statement of profit or loss. Increases that reverse a revaluation decrease on the same asset previously recognised in net result are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Depreciation is recognised based on the fair value and the estimated useful life (in general 20 -50 years). Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. On disposal, the related revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings.\n\nThe fair values of land and buildings are based on regular appraisals performed by independent qualified valuers or by internal valuers. Subsequent expenditure is incl uded in the asset's carrying amount when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.",

If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions. This rate is approximated by using the risk free rate applicable to the lease term, the currency of the lease payment and jurisdiction, with the Fund Transfer Pricing (FTP) rate as an add-on. The FTP rate is used to transfer interest rate risk and funding and liquidity risk positions between the ING Group business and treasury departments. It is determined by either ING Group or Local Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO).\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs and restoration costs.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise mainly IT-equipment (for example mobile phones or laptops) and small items of office furniture.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is included in the statement of financial position lineitem 'Property and equipment', the lease liability is included in the statement of financial position lineitem 'Other liabilities'. Refer to Note 9 'Property and equipment' and Note 16 'Other liabilities'.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, the right-of-use asset amortises using a straight-line method to the income statement over the life of the lease. The lease liability increases for the accrual of interest and decrease when payments are made. Any remeasurement of the lease liability due to a lease modification or other reassessment results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\n\n## ING Group as the lessor\n\nWhen ING Group acts as a lessor, a distinction should be made between finance leases and operating leases. For ING Group as a lessor these are mainly finance leases. The present value of the lease payments is recognised as a receivable under Loans and advances to customers or Loans and advances to banks. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the\n\nreceivable is unearned finance lease income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.\n\n## Operating leases for lessees prior to 1 January 2019 under IAS 17\n\nThe comparative figures presented for 2018 are accounted for using the previous Standard, IAS 17 'Leases'. Under this Standard a distinction was made between finance leases and operating leases for both lessees and lessors. A lease was considered a finance lease if it transfers substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset. All other leases were considered to be operating leases.\n\nLeases entered into by ING Group as a lessee were primarily operating leases and therefore not recognised on the balance sheet. The total payments under operating leases were recognised in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.\n\n## 1.13 Acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets\n\n## Acquisitions and goodwill\n\nING Group's acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Goodwill, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition (including assumed debt) and the Group's interest i n the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as at the date of acquisition, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is only recognised separately on acquisitions. The results of the operations of the acquired companies are included in the statement of profit or loss from the date control is obtained.\n\nWhere applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisitiondate fair value. Contingent consideration arrangements classified as an asset or a liability, are subsequently measured at fair value and the changes in fair value will be recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as equity, are not recognised.",

        "page_content": "- >  1  Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nWhere a business combination is achieved in stages, ING Group's previously held interests in the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date ING Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the statement of profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred and presented in the statement of profit or loss as Other operating expenses.\n\nThe initial accounting for the fair value of the net assets of the companies acquired during the year may be determined only provisionally as the determination of the fair value can be complex and the time between the acquisition and the preparation of the Financial statements can be limited. The initial accounting shall be completed within a year after acquisition. Adjustments to the fair value as at the date of acquisition of acquired assets and liabilities, that are identified within one year after acquisition are recognised as an adjustment to goodwill; any subsequent adjustment is recognised as income or expense. On disposal of group companies where control is lost, the difference between the sale proceeds and carrying value (including goodwill) and the unrealised results (including the currency translation reserve in equity) is included in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other non-financial assets\n\nING Group assesses at each reporting period, whether there is an indication that an intangible asset may be impaired. Irrespective of whether there is an indication of impairment, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill acquired in a business combination, and intangible assets not yet available for use, are tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to groups of CGUs (that is, the group of cash generating units or CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. These groups of CGUs represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the group of CGUs to the recoverable amount of that group of CGUs. The carrying value is determined as the IFRS net asset value including goodwill. In compliance with IAS 36 'Impairment of assets', the carrying value is determined on a basis that is consistent with the way in which the recoverable amount of the CGU is determined. When the carrying values need to be allocated between Retail and Wholesale solvency (risk-weighted assets) are used as a basis. The recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Several methodologies are applied to arrive at the best\n\nestimate of the recoverable amount. Impairment of goodwill, if applicable, is included in the statement of profit or loss in ' Other operating expenses ' .\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software that has been purchased or generated internally for own use is stated at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over its useful life. This period will generally not exceed five years. Amortisation is included in ' Other operating expenses ' .\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets are capitalised and amortised over their expected economic life, which is generally between three and ten years. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortised.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nImpairment test of non-financial assets, mainly related to the assessment for potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, largely software, involves estimation of their recoverable amounts. The review of impairment of nonfinancial assets reflects management's best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors.\n\nThe future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive to the cash flows projected for the periods for which forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of sustainable cash flows thereafter. The accuracy of the forecasted cash flows is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nThe rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their valuation and are based on the costs of capital assigned to individual CGUs. Cost of capital is subject to fluctuations in external market rate s and economic conditions beyond management's control.\n\nKey assumptions used in estimating goodwill and software impairment are described in Note 10 'Intangible assets'.",

Income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss but it is recognised directly in equity if the tax relates to items that are recognised directly in equity.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, for temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided for temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by ING Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The tax effects of income tax losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.\n\nFair value remeasurements of debt and equity instruments measured at FVOCI and cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax related to this fair value remeasurement is also recognised directly in equity and is subsequently recognised in the statement of profit or loss together with the deferred gain or loss.\n\nUncertain tax positions are assessed continually by ING Group and in case it is probable that there will be a cash outflow; a current tax liability is recognised.\n\n## 1.15 Other assets\n\n## Investment property\n\nInvestment properties are recognised at fair value at the balance sheet date. Changes in the carrying amount resulting from revaluations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. On disposal, the difference between the sale proceeds and carrying value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Property obtained from foreclosures\n\nProperty obtained from foreclosures is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price, less applicable variable selling expenses. Property obtained from foreclosures is included in Other assets - Property development and obtained from foreclosures.\n\n## Property development\n\nProperty developed and under development is included in Other assets -Property development and obtained from foreclosures. Depending on the intention of ING Group after completion of the development, the property is measured as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Intention to sell: at the lower of cost and net realisable value;\n- \u25aa Intention to use as a real estate investment: at fair value.\n\n## 1.16 Disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nDisposal groups (and groups of non-current assets) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This is only the case when the sale is highly probable and the disposal group (or group of assets) is available for immediate sale in its present condition; management must be committed to the sale, which is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\nUpon classification as held for sale, the disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except where specifi cally exempt from IFRS 5 'Non -current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group, but not in excess of any",

A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the disposal group is recognised at the date of derecognition. Assets within the disposal group are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised. The assets of the disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.\n\nWhen a group of assets that is classified as held for sale represents a major line of business or geographical area the disposal group is classified as discontinued operations. Upon classification of a business as held for sale and discontinued operations the individual income and expenses are presented within the Total net result from discontinued operations instead of being presented in the usual line items in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. All comparative years in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss are restated and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Furthermore, the individual assets and liabilities are presented in the Consolidated statement of financial position as Assets and liabilities held for sale and are no longer included in the usual line items in the Consolidated statement of financial position. Changes in assets and liabilities as a result of classification as held for sale are included in the notes in the line 'Changes in co mposition of the group and other changes'.\n\n## 1.17 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is a present obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, however the timing or the amount is uncertain. Provisions are discounted when the effect of the time value of money is significant using a pre-tax discount rate.\n\nReorganisation provisions include employee termination benefits when ING Group is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nA liability is recognised for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the liability is recognised only upon reaching the specified minimum threshold.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of ING Group; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because it is either not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position, but are rather disclosed in the notes unless the possibility of the outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of ING Group. Contingent assets are recognised in the statement of financial position only when realisation of the income that arises from such an asset is virtually certain. Contingent assets are disclosed in the notes when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nThe recognition and measurement of provisions is an inherently uncertain process involving using judgement to determine when a present obligation exists and estimates regarding probability, amounts and timing of cash flows.\n\nING Group may become involved in  governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations. The degree of uncertainty and the method of making the accounting estimate depends on the individual case, its nature and complexity. Such cases are usually one of a kind. Judgement is required to assess whether a present obligation exists and to estimate the probability of an unfavourable outcome and the amount of potential loss. For the assessment of related provisions ING Group consults with internal and external legal experts. Even taking into consideration legal experts' advice, the probability of an outflow of economic benefits can still be uncertain and the provision recognised can remain sensitive to the assumptions used.

For  proceedings where it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, that could result from the ultimate resolution of the proceedings, no provision is recognised, however disclosure is included in the financial statements. Reference is made to Note 45 'Legal proceedings'.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions for the reorganisation provision are in estimating the amounts and timing of cash flows as the announced transformation initiatives are implemented over a period of several years . Reference is made to Note 15 'Provisions'.\n\n## 1.18 Other liabilities\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe net defined benefit asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. For determining the pension expense, the return on plan assets is determined using a high quality corporate bond rate identical to the discount rate used in determining the defined benefit obligation.\n\nChanges in plan assets that effect Shareholders' equity and/or Net result, include mainly:\n\n- \u25aa Return on plan assets using a high quality corporate bond rate at the start of the reporting period which are recognised as staff costs in the statement of profit or loss; and\n- \u25aa Remeasurements which are recognised in Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated by internal and external actuaries through actuarial models and calculations using the projected unit credit method. This method considers expected future payments required to settle the obligation resulting from employee service in the current and prior periods, discounted using a high quality corporate bond rate. Inherent in these actuarial models are assumptions including discount rates, rates of increase in future salary and benefit levels, mortality rates, consumer price index and the expected level of indexation. The assumptions are based on available market data as well as management expectations and are updated regularly. The actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from the actual results due to changes in market\n\nconditions, economic and mortality trends, and other assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the defined benefit plan obligation and future pension costs.\n\nChanges in the defined benefit obligation that effects Shareholders' equity and/or Net result, include mainly:\n\n- \u25aa Service cost which are recognised as staff costs in the statement of profit or loss;\n- \u25aa Interest expenses using a high quality corporate bond rate at the start of the period which are recognised as staff costs in the Statement of profit or loss; and\n- \u25aa Remeasurements which are recognised in Other comprehensive income (equity).\n\nRemeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or loss. Any past service cost relating to a plan amendment is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the plan amendment. Gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe recognition of a net defined benefit asset in the Consolidated statement of financial position is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as staff expenses in the profit or loss when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.\n\n## Other post-employment obligations\n\nSome group companies provide other post-employment benefits to former employees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.",

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, ING Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses.\n\nThe calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.\n\nInterest results on instruments classified at Amortised Cost, assets measured at FVOCI and derivatives in a formal hedge accounting relationship is presented in 'Interest income (expense) using effective interest rate method'. Interest result on fina ncial assets and liabilities voluntarily designated as at FVPL and derivatives in so called economic hedges and instruments designated at fair value are presented in 'Other interest income (expense)'. Interest result on all other financial assets and liabi lities at FVTPL is recognised in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\n## Fees and commissions\n\nFees and commissions are generally recognised as the service is provided. Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred (together with related direct costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan. Loan syndication fees are recognised as income when the syndication has been completed and ING Group has retained no part of the loan package for itself or has retained a part at the same effective interest rate as the other participants. Commission and fees arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of, a transaction for a third party -such as the arrangement of the acquisition of shares or other\n\nsecurities or the purchase or sale of businesses -are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction. Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised based on the applicable service contracts as the service is provided. Asset management fees related to investment funds and investment contract fees are recognised on a pro-rata basis over the period the service is provided. The same principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time. Fees received and paid between banks for payment services are classified as commission income and expenses.\n\n## Lease income\n\nThe proceeds from leasing out assets under operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease agreement. Lease payments received in respect of finance leases when ING Group is the lessor are divided into an interest component (recognised as interest income) and a repayment component based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease .\n\n## 1.20 Expense recognition\n\nExpenses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred or when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an increase in a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably. Fee and commission expenses are generally a result from a contract with ING service providers in order to perform the service for ING Group's customers. Costs are generally presented as 'Commission expenses' if they are specific, incremental, directly attributable and identifiable to generate commission income.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nING Group only engages in share-based payment transactions with its staff and directors. Sharebased payment expenses are recognised as a staff expense over the vesting period. A corresponding increase in equity is recognised for equity-settled share-based payment transactions. A liability is recognised for cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at the grant date, and the fair value of cashsettled share-based payment transactions are measured at each balance sheet date. Rights granted will remain valid until the expiry date, even if the share based payment scheme is discontinued. The rights are subject to certain conditions, including a pre-determined continuous period of service.",

In calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding:\n\n- \u25aa Own shares held by group companies are deducted from the total number of ordinary shares in issue;\n- \u25aa The computation is based on daily averages; and\n- \u25aa In case of exercised warrants, the exercise date is taken into consideration.\n\nDiluted earnings per share data are computed as if all convertible instruments outstanding at yearend were exercised at the beginning of the period. It is also assumed that ING Group uses the assumed proceeds thus received to buy its own shares against the average market price in the financial year. The net increase in the number of shares resulting from the exercise is added to the average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share.\n\nShare options with fixed or determinable terms are treated as options in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, even though they may be contingent on vesting. They are treated as outstanding on the grant date. Performance-based employee share options are treated as contingently issuable shares because their issue is contingent upon satisfying specified conditions in addition to the passage of time.\n\n## 1.22 Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method, distinguishing cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In the net cash flow from operating activities, the result before tax is adjusted for those items in the statement of profit or loss and changes in items per the statement of financial position, which do not result in actual cash flows during the year.\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with l ess than three months' maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash and balances with central banks, treasury bills and other eligible bills, amounts due from other banks, and deposits from banks. Investments qualify as a cash equivalent if they are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nCash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.\n\nThe net cash flow shown in respect of Loans and advances to customers relates only to transactions involving actual payments or receipts. The Addition to loan loss provision which is deducted from the item Loans and advances to customers in the statement of financial position has been adjusted accordingly from the result before tax and is shown separately in the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe difference between the Net cash flow in accordance with the statement of cash flows and the change between the opening and closing balance of Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position is due to exchange rate differences and is presented separately in the cash flow statement.\n\nLiabilities arising from financing activities are debt securities and subordinated loans.\n\n## 1.23 Parent company accounts\n\nThe parent company accounts of ING Groep N.V. are prepared in accordance with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with subsection 8 of section 362, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the recognition and measurement principles applied in the Parent company accounts are the same as those applied in the Consolidated financial statements.",

The hedges do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and the loans are recorded at fair value to avoid an accounting mismatch. The maximum credit exposure of the loans and receivables included in 'Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss' approximates its carrying value. The cumulative change in fair value of the loans attributable to changes in credit risk is not significant.\n\nThe notional value of the related credit derivatives is EUR 1,077 million (2019: EUR 1,672 million). The cumulative change in fair value of the credit derivatives attributable to changes in credit risk since the financial assets were first designated, amounts to EUR -16 million (2019: EUR 29 million) and the change for the current year amounts to EUR -45 million (2019: EUR -52 million).\n\nThese have been calculated by determining the changes in credit spread implicit in the fair value of bonds issued by entities with similar credit characteristics.\n\n## Mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                       | Mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss by type   | Mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss by type   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2020                                                       | 2019                                                       |\n| Equity securities     | 228                                                        | 159                                                        |\n| Debt securities       | 787                                                        | 733                                                        |\n| Loans and receivables | 43,290                                                     | 40,708                                                     |\n|                       | 44,305                                                     | 41,600                                                     |\n\nNone of the equity securities are individually significant for ING Group.\n\nFor details on ING Group's total exposure to debt securities reference is made to Note 6 'Securities at amortised cost'.\n\n## 5   Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income by type   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity securities                                                           | 1,862  | 2,306  |\n| Debt securities 1                                                           | 32,977 | 30,483 |\n| Loans and advances 1                                                        | 1,056  | 1,680  |\n|                                                                             | 35,895 | 34,468 |\n\n1 Debt securities include an amount of EUR -12 million (2019: EUR -7 million)  and the Loans and advances includes EUR -2 million (2019: EUR -3 million) of Loan loss provisions.\n\n## Exposure to equity securities\n\n## Equity securities designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n|                               | Carrying  value   | Carrying  value   |   Dividend  income |   Dividend  income |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Investment in Bank of Beijing | 1,662             | 2,001             |                 95 |                 93 |\n| Other Investments             | 200               | 305               |                 12 |                 18 |\n|                               | 1,862             | 2,306             |                107 |                111 |",

To a lesser extent, the finance lease receivables relate to real estate for third parties, where ING is the lessor. These finance lease receivables are part of loans secured by mortgages. Interest income in 2020 on Finance lease receivables amounts to EUR 229 million (2019: EUR 251 million).\n\nExpected credit losses for uncollectable finance lease receivables of EUR 164 million as at 31 December 2020 (2019: EUR 136 million) is included in the loan loss provision. The loan loss provision for finance lease receivables is classified into the following loan loss provision stages; stage 1: EUR 8 million (2019: EUR 2 million), stage 2: EUR 25 million (2019: EUR 6 million), and stage 3: EUR 131 million (2019: EUR 128 million).\n\nNo individual finance lease receivable has terms and conditions that significantly affect the amount, timing or certainty of the consolidated cash flows of the Group.\n\n## 8   Investment in associates and joint ventures\n\n| 2020                                                | Interest  held (%)   | Fair value  of listed  invest-  ments   | Balance  sheet  value   | Total  assets   | Total  liabilities   | Total  income   | Total  expenses   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| TMB Public Company Limited                          | 23                   | 653                                     | 1,202                   | 50,123          | 44,597               | 1,388           | 1,093             |\n| Other investments in associates and joint  ventures |                      |                                         | 273                     |                 |                      |                 |                   |\n|                                                     |                      |                                         | 1,475                   |                 |                      |                 |                   |\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\n| 2019                                                | Interest  held (%)   | Fair value  of listed  invest-  ments   | Balance  sheet  value   | Total  assets   | Total  liabilities   | Total  income   | Total  expenses   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| TMB Public Company Limited                          | 23                   | 1,109                                   | 1,509                   | 55,804          | 49,974               | 1,145           | 891               |\n| Other investments in associates and joint  ventures |                      |                                         | 281                     |                 |                      |                 |                   |\n|                                                     |                      |                                         | 1,790                   |                 |                      |                 |                   |\n\nThe reporting dates of certain associates and joint ventures can differ from the reporting date of the Group, but by no more than three months.\n\n## TMB Bank Public Company Limited\n\nING Group has a 23% investment in TMB Bank Public Company Limited (hereafter: TMB), a bank listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. TMB is providing products and services to Wholesale, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), and Retail customers. In December 2019 TMB merged with Thanachart Bank and became Thailand's sixth largest bank.\n\nTMB is accounted for as an investment in associate based on the size of ING shareholding and representation on the Board. IFRS requires to test its investment in TMB for impairment when there is an indication that impairment might exist.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nIn 2020, the fair value of ING's investment in TMB significantly declined below the purchase cost. This indicator triggered ING to perform an impairment test on the recoverability of the investment of TMB. The impairment test performed led to an impairment at 30 September 2020 of EUR 230 million, as the recoverable amount of EUR 1,181 million, as determined by a Value in Use calculation, was below the carrying amount of EUR 1,411 million at that point in time. The impairment test at year end resulted in no further impairments.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and Value in Use ('VIU'). Fair value less costs of disposal is b ased on observable share price. The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow pr ojections based on management's best estimates. VIU is derived using a Dividend Discount Model (DDM) where distributable equity, i.e. future earnings available to ordinary shareholders, is used as a proxy for future cash flows. The valuation looks at expected cash flows into perpetuity resulting in two main components to the VIU calculation:\n\ni) the estimation of future earnings over a 5 year forecast period; and ii) the terminal value being the extrapolation of earnings into perpetuity applying a long term growth rate. The earnings that are used for extrapolation represent the stable long term financial results and position of TMB, i.e. a steady state. The terminal value comprises the majority of the total VIU.",

The key assumptions, i.e. those to which the overall result is most sensitive to, are the following:\n\n- \uf0a0 Expected future earnings of TMB: based on forecasts derived from broker consensus over the short to medium term and TMB observable targets for steady state earnings into perpetuity. A capital maintenance charge is applied, which is management's forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in order for TMB to meet target regulatory requirements over the forecast period;\n- \uf0a0 Terminal growth rate: 1.6% for periods after 2024, consistent with current long term government bond yield in Thailand as a proxy for a risk-free rate (30 September 2020: 3.0% consistent with long term forecasts of GDP growth in Thailand);\n- \uf0a0 Discount rate (cost of equity): 8.49%, based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) calculated for TMB, using current market data (30 September 2020: 9.8%).\n\nThe terminal growth rate and the discount rate are interdependent. Following the use of the long term government bond yield as a basis for terminal growth rate at year-end, cost of equity was adjusted accordingly (reducing cost of equity). This change did not have a significant impact on value in use as at 31 December 2020. Furthermore, following the approval of vaccines and improvement in the share price of TMB observed in the last quarter of the year, in line with the general market, the level of confidence in the forecasted cash flows of TMB increased compared to 30 September 2020. This allowed ING to remove the additional forecasting risk factor from cost of equity at year-end compared to 30 September 2020. Even if the additional forecasting risk factor remained in the cost of equity as at 31 December 2020, this would not have resulted in impairment at year-end in addition to the impairment already recognised at 30 September 2020.\n\nAt year end 2020 the model was tested for reasonably possible changes to key assumptions in the model. This reflects the sensitivity of the VIU to each key assumption on its own and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change may occur at the same time. Holding the other key assumptions constant, a reduction in all of the forecasted annual cashflows, including terminal value, of 17.6% would reduce the recoverable amount to the carrying amount. A 589bps decrease in long term growth rate or a 153bps increase in the discount rate would cause the VIU to equal the carrying amount.\n\n## Other investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nIncluded in Other investments in associates and joint ventures are mainly financial services and financial technology funds or vehicles operating predominantly in Europe.\n\nOther investments in associates and joint ventures represents a number of associates and joint ventures that are individually not significant to ING Group.\n\nSignificant influence for associates in which the interest held is below 20%, is based on the combination of ING Group 's financial interest and other arrangements, such as participation in the Board of Directors.\n\nThe associates and joint ventures of ING are subject to legal and regulatory restrictions regarding the amount of dividends it can pay to ING. These restrictions are for example dependent on the laws in the country of incorporation for declaring dividends or as a result of minimum capital requirements that are imposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the associates and joint ventures operate. In addition, the associates and joint ventures also consider other factors in determining the appropriate levels of equity needed. These factors and limitations include, but are not limited to, rating agency and regulatory views, which can change over time.\n\n| Changes in Investments in associates and joint ventures   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance                                           | 1,790  | 1,203  |\n| Additions                                                 | 24     | 507    |\n| Revaluations                                              | -3     | -18    |\n| Share of results                                          | 66     | 82     |\n| Dividends received                                        | -12    | -58    |\n| Disposals                                                 | -12    | -10    |\n| Impairments                                               | -235   | -34    |\n| Exchange rate differences                                 | -144   | 113    |\n| Other                                                     | 0      | 4      |\n| Closing balance                                           | 1,475  | 1,790  |\n\nShare of results from associates and joint ventures of EUR 66 million (2019: EUR 82 million) as included in the table above is mainly attributable to results of TMB of EUR 70 million (2019: EUR 77 million).",

The key assumptions used in the calculation of the recoverable amounts are included in the table above. In addition ING Group tests goodwill whenever a triggering event is identified.\n\nCovid-19 has resulted in adverse changes in the market and economic environment. Due to the impact of the significant deterioration in the economic environment on the cash flow outlook of our businesses, we also completed a goodwill impairment review across ING Group in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nGoodwill impairment test performed in the second quarter resulted in the recognition of goodwill impairments on the CGU Retail Belgium of EUR 50 million (of which EUR 43 million is reported in Retail Belgium segment and EUR 8 million in Corporate Line segment) and on the CGU Wholesale Banking of EUR 260 million (fully reported in the Wholesale Banking segment).\n\nFor both CGUs the impairment resulted from the negative developments in the macro-economic outlook in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the applicable discount rate is also affected by the deteriorated economic and risk environment. The discount rate used to estimate the value in use of the CGU Belgium as at 30 June 2020 was 9.54 % (31 December 2019: 6.94 %). The discount rate used to estimate the value in use of CGU Wholesale Banking, which is based on the weighted average of the discount rates of various local businesses as Wholesale Banking is a global business line, was at 30 June 9.38% (31 December 2019: 7.29%). The terminal growth rate used to estimate the value in use of the CGU Belgium was 0.00% at 30 June 2020 and it was not changed compared to Q4 2019 (31 December 2019: 0.00 %). The terminal growth rate used to estimate the value in use of CGU Wholesale Banking  was at 30 June 0.85% (31 December 2019: 0.69%).\n\nFor each of the other groups of CGUs the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the CGUs as at 31 December 2020 and therefore no impairment is required.",

        "page_content": "- >  11   Other assets\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn line with IFRS, the recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and Value in Use (VIU). The VIU calculation is based on a Dividend Discount model using three year management approved plans, updated for the expected impact of Covid-19. When estimating the VIU of a CGU, local conditions and requirements determine the capital requirements, discount rates, and terminal growth rates.  These local conditions and requirements determine the ability to upstream excess capital and profits to ING Group. The discount rate calculation includes other inputs such as equity market premium, country risk premium, and long term inflation which are based on market sources and management's judgement. The long term growth rate for EU-countries is based on long term risk-free rate by reference to the yield of a composite index consisting of Euro generic government bonds, with a maturity of 30 years. For other countries, the growth rate includes long term inflation rate obtained from market sources.\n\n## Sensitivity of key assumptions\n\nKey assumptions in the goodwill impairment test model are the projected locally available cash flows (based on local capital requirements and projected profits), discount rates (cost of equity), and long term growth rates.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the unimpaired CGUs are sensitive to the above key assumptions. A decrease in the available cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate of 1 percent point or a reduction of future growth rate to zero are considered reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. If the aforementioned changes occur to the above key assumptions holding the other key assumptions constant, goodwill of the remaining CGUs will continue to be recoverable and no impairment will occur.\n\n## Other changes\n\nOther changes in goodwill in 2020 relate to changes in currency exchange rates of CGUs Wholesale Banking and Retail Growth Markets goodwill.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware, includes internally developed software amounting to EUR 688 million (2019: EUR 741 million).\n\nFollowing the decision to discontinue the Maggie programme an impairment of EUR 141 million was recognised  in  2020,  primarily  related  to  capitalised  software  development  costs.  In  addition,  an impairment of EUR 19 million with regards software in the payments and cash management business was recognised. The rest of the software impairment relates to various, individually immaterial items.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nIn 2020 an impairment of an indefinite useful life asset of EUR 14 million was recognised, related to brand names (2019: nil) and additional EUR 20 million was recognised related to intangible assets from a previous acquisition (customer relationships), following a re-evaluation of the business plan.\n\n## 11   Other assets\n\n| Other assets by type                                |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                                                     | 2020  | 2019  |\n| Net defined benefit assets                          | 725   | 709   |\n| Investment properties                               | 20    | 46    |\n| Property development and obtained from foreclosures | 72    | 98    |\n| Accrued assets                                      | 781   | 783   |\n| Amounts to be settled                               | 2,215 | 2,835 |\n| Other                                               | 2,079 | 2,546 |\n|                                                     | 5,893 | 7,018 |\n\nDisclosures in respect of Net defined benefit assets are provided in Note 36 'Pension and other post -employment benefits'.\n\nAmounts to be settled include primarily transactions not settled at the balance sheet date.

ING participated in a new series of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III) for EUR 4.5 billion in March 2020, EUR 55.0 billion in June 2020 and repaid EUR 17.7 billion of the previous TLTRO (TLTRO II).\n\nThe TLTRO III funding is granted for a period of three years with an early repayment option after one year with the earliest date of September 2021. The three new participation windows introduced by the ECB press release in December 2020, can be repaid quarterly from June 2022. Interest under TLTRO III will be settled on maturity of each TLTRO III operation or on early repayment. The interest rate on TLTRO III depends on the lending volumes granted to corporates (excluding financial institutions) and households (excluding mortgages).\n\nUnder the conditions of the program, interest rates can be as favorable as 50 basis points below the average interest rate on the Deposit Facility rate, but in any case not higher than -1%. Such a rate would apply to all TLTRO III operations outstanding over the discrete periods between 24 June 2020 and 23 June 2021 (special interest period 1), and between 24 June 2021 and 23 June 2022 (special interest period 2), for banks that show growth in lending volumes equal to or above 0% between 1 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 (observation period 1) and 1 October 2020 and 31 December 2021 (observation period 2), respectively. In case lending growth targets are not met, the interest rate during the special interest periods can in a worst case scenario be at 50 basis points below the average Main Refinancing Operations rate over the same period. In the period preceding and following the\n\nspecial interest periods the interest will be in a corridor between the Deposit Facility and Main Refinancing Operations rates, depending to what extent ING meets the lending growth conditions of the TLTRO III program. Special interest period 2 was announced by the ECB in its press release in December 2020 and confirmed in January 2021.\n\nThe amount of interest income recognised during the period on the TLTRO III depends on a reasonable expectation of whether the conditions will be met. Interest income on ING's participation in TLTRO III of EUR 164 million was recognised in the statement of profit and loss (please refer to Note 20 Net interest income). Interest income recognised in 2020 for TLTRO III is based on -50 bps (the Main Refinancing Operations rate minus 50 bps), which is in substance an unconditional rate during June 2020 -June 2021 and does not depend on whether the lending targets are achieved. At 31 December 2020 ING assessed that it is not yet highly probable that lending targets will be met. Any conditional benefit from TLTRO III has not been included yet.\n\n## 13   Customer deposits\n\n| Customer deposits                    |         |         |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                      | 2020    | 2019    |\n| Savings accounts                     | 336,517 | 326,942 |\n| Credit balances on customer accounts | 256,636 | 224,022 |\n| Corporate deposits                   | 15,941  | 22,329  |\n| Other                                | 548     | 1,140   |\n|                                      | 609,642 | 574,433 |\n\n## Customer deposits by type\n\n|                      | Netherlands   | Netherlands   | Rest of the world   | Rest of the world   |         | Total   |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|\n|                      | 2020          | 2019          | 2020                | 2019                | 2020    | 2019    |\n| Non-interest bearing | 24,206        | 19,030        | 42,211              | 24,782              | 66,417  | 43,812  |\n| Interest bearing     | 174,744       | 159,664       | 368,481             | 370,957             | 543,225 | 530,621 |\n|                      | 198,950       | 178,694       | 410,692             | 395,739             | 609,642 | 574,433 |\n\nSavings accounts relate to the balances on savings accounts, savings books, savings deposits, and time deposits of private individuals.",

Pursuant to the Dutch Civil Code, dividends can only be paid up to an amount equal to the excess of the company's own funds over the sum of the paid -up capital and reserves required by law.\n\nMoreover, ING Groep N.V.'s ability to pay dividends is dependent on the div idend payment ability of its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. ING Groep N.V. is legally required to create a nondistributable reserve insofar as profits of its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are subject to dividend payment restrictions which apply to those subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures themselves.\n\nNon distributable reserves, determined in accordance with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, from ING Group's subsi diaries, associates and joint ventures are as follows:\n\n## Non-distributable reserves\n\n|                            | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| ING Bank                   | 9,829  | 8,397  | 7,603  |\n| Other                      | 2      | 0      | 97     |\n| Non-distributable reserves | 9,831  | 8,398  | 7,700  |\n\nIn addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions on distributing dividends from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to ING Groep N.V. there are various other considerations and limitations that are taken into account in determining the appropriate levels of equity in the Group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. These considerations and limitations include, but are not restricted to, minimum capital requirements that are imposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate, or other limitations which may exist in certain countries and may or may not be temporary in nature. It is not possible to disclose a reliable quantification of these limitations. For an overview of the minimal capital requirements of ING Group refer to the 'Capital Management' section.\n\nWithout prejudice to the authority of the Executive Board to allocate profits to reserves and to the fact that the ordinary shares are the most junior securities issued by ING Groep N.V., no specific dividend payment restrictions with respect to ordinary shares exist. The European Central Bank has recommended banks in December 2020 to limit dividend distributions out of cumulative 2019 and 2020 profits, given the persisting uncertainty over the economic impact the Covid-19 pandemic. Refer to 'Capital Management' section for further details.\n\nFurthermore, ING Groep N.V. is subject to legal restrictions with respect to repayment of capital to holders of ordinary shares. Pursuant to the Dutch Civil Code, capital may only be repaid if none of ING Groep N.V.'s creditors opposes such a repayment within two months following the announcement of a resolution to that effect.",

The par value of these cumulative preference shares is EUR 0.01.\n\nThe cumulative preference shares rank before the ordinary shares in entitlement to dividend and to distributions upon liquidation of ING Groep N.V.\n\nThe dividend on the cumulative preference shares will be equal to a percentage, calculated on the amount compulsorily paid up or yet to be paid up. This percentage shall be equal to the average of the Euro shortterm rate (\u20acSTR) as calculated by the European Central Bank during the financial year for which the distribution is made; this percentage being weighted on the basis of the number of days for which it applies, and increased by 2.585 percentage points.\n\nIf, and to the extent that the profit available for distribution is not sufficient to pay the dividend referred to above in full, the shortfall will be made up from the reserves insofar as possible. If, and to the extent that, the dividend distribution cannot be made from the reserves, the profits earned in subsequent years shall first be used to make up the shortfall before any distribution may be made on shares of any other category.\n\nING Groep N.V.'s A rticles of Association make provision for the cancellation of cumulative preference shares. Upon cancellation of cumulative preference shares and upon liquidation of ING Groep N.V., the amount paid up on the cumulative preference shares will be repaid together with the accrued dividend as well as any dividend shortfall in preceding years, insofar as this shortfall has not yet been made up.\n\nNo specific dividend payment restrictions with respect to the cumulative preference shares exist.",

Negative interest on liabilities in 2020, amounting to EUR 678 million (2019: EUR 422 million) includes interest income on ING's participation in TLTRO III of EUR 164 million and TLTRO II of EUR 24 million (2019: TLTRO II EUR 57 million).

        "page_content": "- >  23   Investment income\n\nNet trading income relates to trading assets and trading liabilities which include assets and liabilities that are classified under IFRS as Trading but are closely related to servicing the needs of the clients of ING. ING offers products that are traded on the financial markets to institutional clients, corporate clients, and governments. ING Group's trading books are managed based on internal limits and comprise a mix of products with results which could be offset. A significant part of the derivatives in the trading portfolio are related to servicing corporate clients in their risk management to hedge for example currency or interest rate exposures. From a risk perspective, the gross amount of trading assets must be considered together with the gross amount of trading liabilities, which are presented separately on the statement of financial position. However, IFRS does not always allow netting of these positions in the statement of financial position. Reference is made to Note 4 'Financial assets at fair va lue through profit or loss' and Note 14 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss' for information on trading assets and trading liabilities respectively.\n\n'Valuation results and net trading income' include the fair value movements on der ivatives (used for both hedge accounting and economically hedging exposures) as well as the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities included in hedging relationships as hedged items. Reference is made to Note 39 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for information on derivatives used for hedge accounting.\n\nIn general, the fair value movements are influenced by changes in the market conditions, such as stock prices, credit spreads, interest rates and currency exchange rates. Following the increased concerns about the Covid-19 pandemic, the global financial markets experienced more volatility than usual in the first half of 2020 which had considerable impact on the results. Aided by substantial central bank intervention, markets have recovered and stabilised during the second half of 2020 and volatility has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFurthermore, derivatives trading results is also impacted by fair value movements arising from changes in credit spreads (CVA and DVA), bid offer spreads, model risk and incremental cost of funding on derivatives (FVA and CollVA). As result of the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, ING also observed significant widening of the spreads resulting in increased negative fair value changes. As markets stabilised in the second half of 2020 and spreads tightened, the fair value changes decreased again.\n\nIn 2020, Derivatives trading results include EUR 17 million CVA/DVA adjustments on trading derivatives (2019: EUR 39 million; 2018: EUR -20 million).\n\n'Valuation results on assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss' include fair value changes on financial liabilities driven by changed market conditions as disclosed in Note 14 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nIn 2020, Valuation results on assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (excluding trading) include fair value adjustments on own issued notes amounting to EUR -1 million (2019: EUR -424 million; 2018: EUR 302 million).\n\nInterest income from trading assets in 2020 amounted to EUR 13,412 million (2019: EUR  15,187 million; 2018: 13,924 million). Interest expense from trading liabilities in 2020  amounted to EUR 13,052 million (2019: EUR 14,922 million; 2018: 13,976 million).\n\n## 23   Investment income\n\n## Investment income\n\n|                                                                         |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Dividend income                                                         |    107 |    115 |    102 |\n| Realised gains/losses on disposal of debt instruments measured at FVOCI |     44 |     46 |     77 |\n| Income from and fair value gains/losses on investment properties        |      1 |     27 |      4 |\n| Investment income                                                       |    152 |    188 |    183 |\n\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018 dividend income mainly consists of dividend received from ING's equity stake in Bank of Beijing.",

In addition, Other income is impacted by positive and negative non-recurring results, including a loss of EUR 58 million following a settlement with the Australian Tax Authorities related to former insurance activities, that were fully indemnified by NN Group. This was offset by a tax profit for the same amount resulting from the release of the provision for uncertain tax positions in current tax liabilities. In 2019, Other income also included the recognition of EUR 79 million receivable related to the insolvency of a financial institution.\n\n## 27   Staff Expenses\n\n## Staff expenses\n\n|                                                     | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Salaries                                            | 3,751  | 3,572  | 3,287  |\n| Pension costs and other staff-related benefit costs | 395    | 366    | 385    |\n| Social security costs                               | 538    | 530    | 509    |\n| Share-based compensation arrangements               | 19     | 41     | 49     |\n| External employees                                  | 881    | 974    | 901    |\n| Education                                           | 43     | 64     | 87     |\n| Other staff costs                                   | 186    | 208    | 202    |\n|                                                     | 5,812  | 5,755  | 5,420  |\n\nShare-based compensation arrangements include EUR 17 million (2019: EUR 38 million; 2018: EUR 46 million) relating to equity-settled share-based payment arrangements and EUR 2 million (2019: EUR 3 million; 2018: EUR 3 million) relating to cash-settled share-based payment arrangements.",

The purpose of the option and share schemes, apart from promoting a lasting growth of ING Group, is to attract, retain and motivate senior executives and staff.\n\nING grants various types of share awards, namely deferred shares, performance shares and upfront shares, which form part of the variable remuneration offering via the Long-term Sustainable Performance Plan (LSPP). The entitlement to the LSPP share awards is granted conditionally. If the participant remains in employment for an uninterrupted period between the grant date and the vesting date, the entitlement becomes unconditional, with the exception of the upfront shares which are immediately vested upon grant. Additionally, a condition before vesting is applied to performance shares until 2018. As of 2019, this performance condition is no longer applicable. Upfront and deferred shares awarded to the Management Board members of ING Group as well as identified staff, have a retention obligation that must be adhered to upon vesting, typically a minimum retention of 12 months applies. ING has the authority to apply a holdback to awarded but unvested shares and a clawback to vested shares.\n\nIn addition to the LSPP share awards, ING paid a number of senior employees fixed shares. The number of shares were determined each month from a cash value that forms part of the employee fixed remuneration. The shares were immediately vested to the employee, but had a minimum holding\n\nrequirement of two years before the employee can dispose of the shares. The fixed shares are not subject to holdback or clawback.\n\nThe share awards granted in 2020 relate to the performance year 2019. In 2020, 63,837  share awards (2019: 0; 2018:31,743) were granted to the members of the Executive Board of ING Groep N.V., and 122,338 share awards (2019: 2,837; 2018: 80,036) were granted to the Management Board Banking. To senior management and other employees  3,678,776 share awards (2019: 2,167,817; 2018: 3,989,214) were granted.\n\nIn 2010, the Group Executive Board decided not to continue the option scheme as from 2011. The existing option schemes have run off during the year as the option rights have expired.\n\nThe obligations with regard to share plans are funded by newly issued shares at the discretion of ING Group.\n\n## Changes in share awards\n\n|                    | Share awards (in numbers)   | Share awards (in numbers)          | Share awards (in numbers)   | Weighted average grant date fair  values (in euros)   |   Weighted average grant date fair  values (in euros) |   Weighted average grant date fair  values (in euros) |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | 2020                        | 2019                               | 2018                        | 2020                                                  |                                               2019    |                                               2018    |\n| Opening balance    | 3,857,048                   | 5,854,999                          | 7,222,279                   | 11.14                                                 |                                                 11.62 |                                                 11.46 |\n| Granted            | 3,864,951                   | 2,170,654                          | 4,100,993                   | 5.12                                                  |                                                 10.04 |                                                 12.5  |\n| Performance effect |                             |                                    | 341,623                     |                                                       |                                                 11.12 |                                                 11.65 |\n| Vested             |                             | -3,690,340  -3,945,020  -5,565,093 |                             | 9.01                                                  |                                                 11.23 |                                                 12.05 |\n| Forfeited          | -153,440                    | -223,585                           | -244,803                    | 8.55                                                  |                                                 11.39 |                                                 11.52 |\n| Closing balance    |                             | 3,878,219  3,857,048  5,854,999    |                             | 7.25                                                  |                                                 11.14 |                                                 11.62 |\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 the share awards consists of 3,326,457 share awards (2019: 3,346,004; 2018: 5,211,339) relating to equity-settled share-based payment arrangements and 551,762 share awards (2019: 511,044; 2018: 643,660) relating to cash-settled share-based payment arrangements.\n\nThe fair value of share awards granted is recognised as an expense under Staff expenses and is allocated over the vesting period of the share awards.

The ECB subsequently updated their recommendation, lastly in December 2020, extending the timeframe to 1 October 2021. Final dividend 2019 was therefore not paid in 2020.\n\nING paid in February 2021 a cash-only interim dividend of EUR 468 million (EUR 0.12 per share). This amount is equal to 15% of adjusted net profit for 2020, in line with the ECB recommendation of 15 December 2020, which included a definition of adjusted net profit.\n\nRefer to note 51 Capital Management for more information about the change in ING's dividend policy and the ECB recommendations regarding dividend payments\n\n0",

The Executive Board and the Management Board Banking consider this to be relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance, because it all ows investors to understand the\n\nprimary method used by management to evaluate the Group's operating performance and make decisions about allocating resources.\n\nING Group reconciles the total segment results to the total result using Corporate Line. The Corporate Line is a reflection of capital management activities and certain income and expenses that are not allocated to the banking businesses, including the recognition of value-added tax (VAT) refunds in the Netherlands (recorded under expenses). In 2020, net interest income on the Corporate Line sharply declined, mainly due to lower interest results from foreign currency hedging due to lower interest rate differentials. In 2019, a EUR 119 million gain from the release of a currency translation reserve following the sale of ING's stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank was included, and the recognition of a EUR 79 million receivable related to the insolvency of a financial institution (both recorded under income). In 2018, the EUR 775 million settlement agreement with the Dutch authorities on regulatory issues was included, as well as a EUR 90 million net result from the former Insurance activities. Furthermore, the Corporate Line includes the isolated legacy costs (mainly negative interest results) caused by the replacement of short-term funding with long-term funding during 2013 and 2014. ING Group applies a system of capital charging for its banking operations in order to create a comparable basis for the results of business units g lobally, irrespective of the business units' book equity and the currency they operate in.\n\nAs from the financial year 2020 the information presented to the Executive Board is no longer based on underlying results but on IFRS as endorsed by the EU. Previously monitoring and evaluation of ING Group's segments was based on a non -GAAP financial performance measure called underlying. Underlying result was derived by excluding from IFRS the following: special items, the impact of divestments and results from former insurance related activities. In 2020 and 2019 no special items, divestments or results from former insurance related activities were recorded anymore. 2018 included a special item of EUR 775 million related to the aforementioned settlement agreement, as well as a EUR 90 million net result from the former Insurance activities.\n\nThe information presented in this note is in line with the information presented to the Executive Board of ING Group and Management Board Banking.\n\nThis note does not provide information on the revenue specified to each product or service as this is not reported internally and is therefore not readily available.",

A geographical area is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of geographical areas operating in other economic environments. The geographical analyses are based on the location of the office from which the transactions are originated and do not include countries where ING only has representation offices. The Netherlands is ING Group's country of domicile.\n\n## Additional information by country\n\nIn order to increase ING Group 's tax transparency, additional financial information on a per country

The assets of all ING Group's defined contribution plans are held in independently administered funds. Contributions are generally determined as a percentage of remuneration. Contributions, including the defined contribution plan in the Netherlands, are principally determined as a percentage of renumeration. These plans do not give rise to provisions in the statement of financial position, other than relating to short-term timing differences included in other assets/liabilities.\n\nING Group maintains defined benefit retirement plans in some countries. These plans provide benefits that are related to the remuneration and service of employees upon retirement. The benefits in some of these plans are subject to various forms of indexation. The indexation is, in some cases, at the discretion of management; in other cases it is dependent upon the sufficiency of plan assets.\n\nAnnual contributions are paid to the funds at a rate necessary to adequately finance the accrued liabilities of the plans calculated in accordance with local legal requirements. Plans in all countries are designed to comply with applicable local regulations governing investments and funding levels.\n\nING Group provides other post-employment benefits to certain former employees. These are primarily discounts on ING products.",

The assumptions used in the determination of the net defined benefit asset/liability and the Other post-employment benefits include discount rates, mortality rates, expected rates of salary increases (excluding promotion increases), and indexation. The rates used for salary developments, interest discount factors, and other adjustments reflect country-specific conditions.\n\nThe key assumption in the determination of the net defined benefit asset/liability is the discount rate. The discount rate is the weighted average of the discount rates that are applied in different regions where ING Group has defined benefit pension plans (weighted by the defined benefit obligation). The discount rate is based on a methodology that uses market yields on high quality corporate bonds of the specific regions with durations matching the pension liabilities as key input.

        "page_content": "- >  37   Taxation\n\nquality corporate bonds reflect the yield on corporate bonds with an AA rating for durations where such yields are available. An extrapolation is applied in order to determine the yield to the longer durations for which no AA-rated corporate bonds are available. As a result of the limited availability of long-duration AA-rated corporate bonds, extrapolation is an important element of the determination of the discount rate. The weighted average discount rate applied for net defined benefit asset/liability for 2020 was 1.0% (2019:  1.5%) based on the pension plan in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, The United States of America, and the United Kingdom. The average discount rate applied for Other postemployment benefits was  2.7% (2019:  3.3%).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of key assumptions\n\nING performs sensitivity analysis on the most significant assumptions: discount rates, mortality, expected rate of salary increase, and indexation. The sensitivity analysis has been carried out under the assumption that the changes occurred at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis calculates the financial impact on the defined benefit obligation of an increase or decrease of the weighted averages of each significant actuarial assumption, all other assumptions held constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and some changes of the assumptions may be correlated. Changes to mortality, expected rate of salary increase, and indexation would have no material impact on the defined benefit obligation. The most significant impact would be from a change in the discount rate. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of 1% creates an impact on the defined benefit obligation of EUR-461 million and EUR 586 million, respectively.\n\n## Expected cash flows\n\nAnnual contributions are paid to the funds at a rate necessary to adequately finance the accrued liabilities of the plans calculated in accordance with local supervisory requirements. Plans in all countries are designed to comply with applicable local regulations governing investments and funding levels. ING Group's subsidiaries should fund the cost of t he entitlements expected to be earned on a yearly basis.\n\nFor 2021 the expected contributions to defined benefit pension plans are EUR 31 million.\n\nThe benefit payments for defined benefit and other post-employment benefits expected to be made by the plan between 2021-2025 are estimated to be between EUR 110 million and EUR 138 million per year. From 2026 to 2030 the total payments made by the plan are expected to be EUR 724 million.\n\n## 37   Taxation\n\n## Statement of financial position -Deferred tax\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised on all temporary differences under the liability method using tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which ING Group is subject to taxation.\n\n## Changes in deferred tax\n\n| 2020

deferred tax of EUR 170 million (2019: EUR 163 million) and the related unused tax losses carried forward exclude the deferred tax liability recorded in the Netherlands with respect to the recapture of previously deducted UK tax losses in the Netherlands for the amount of EUR -107 million (2019: EUR -102 million).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for temporary deductible differences, for tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.\n\n|             | Breakdown of certain net deferred tax asset positions by

Changes in circumstances in future periods may adversely impact the assessment of the recoverability. The uncertainty of the recoverability is taken into account in establishing the deferred tax assets.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, ING Groep N.V. had no significant temporary differences associated with the parent company's investments in subsidiaries as any economic benefit from those investments will not be taxable at parent company level.\n\n## Statement of profit or loss -Taxation\n\n| Taxation by type   | Total       | Total       | Total       | Total             | Total             | Total             | Total             | Total   | Total   |\n|--------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|---------|\n|                    | Netherlands | Netherlands | Netherlands | Rest of the world | Rest of the world | Rest of the world | Rest of the world |         |         |\n|                    | 2020        | 2019        | 2018        | 2020              | 2019              | 2018              | 2020              | 2019    | 2018    |\n| Current taxation   | 355         | 488         | 587         | 1,016             | 1,481             | 1,264             | 1,371             | 1,970   | 1,851   |\n| Deferred taxation  | 64          | 42          | 37          | -189              | -57               | 138               | -125              | -15     | 175     |\n|                    | 420         | 530         | 624         | 826               | 1,425             | 1,402             | 1,246             | 1,955   | 2,027   |\n\n|                                                           | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Result before tax from continuing operations              | 3,809  | 6,834  | 6,838  |\n| Weighted average statutory tax rate                       | 25.6%  | 25.9%  | 25.9%  |\n| Weighted average statutory tax amount                     | 974    | 1,769  | 1,772  |\n| Participation exemption                                   | -46    | -49    | -77    |\n| Other income not subject to tax                           | -6     | -76    | -70    |\n| Expenses not deductible for tax purposes                  | 320    | 237    | 346    |\n| Impact on deferred tax from change in tax rates           | 10     | -64    | -8     |\n| Deferred tax benefit from previously unrecognised amounts | -6     |        |        |\n| Current tax from previously unrecognised amounts          | 17     | 48     | 28     |\n| Write-off/reversal of deferred tax assets                 | 24     | 2      | 4      |\n| State and local taxes                                     | 44     | 72     | 25     |\n| Adjustments to prior periods                              | -85    | 16     | 7      |\n| Effective tax amount                                      | 1,246  | 1,955  | 2,027  |\n| Effective tax rate                                        | 32.7%  | 28.6%  | 29.6%  |\n\nThe weighted average statutory tax rate in 2020 (25.6%) is comparable to that of 2019.\n\nThe effective tax rate of 32.7% in 2020 is significantly higher than the weighted average statutory tax rate.

The existence of this obligation will be confirmed only by the occurrence of future profits in the United Kingdom.\n\n## 38 Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\n## a) Valuation Methods\n\nThe estimated fair values represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is a market-based measurement, which is based on assumptions that market participants would use and takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nFair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on quoted prices in active market where available. When such quoted prices are not available, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels, depending upon whether fair values were determined based on (unadjusted) quoted prices in an active market (Level 1), valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2) or valuation techniques that incorporate inputs which are unobservable and which have a more than insignificant impact on the fair value of the instrument (Level 3).\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic impacted the global financial markets in 2020. In the beginning of 2020, ING observed large volatility in the market resulting in widened spreads, markets distortion and illiquidity in some specif ic markets which has stressed ING's valuation processes and movements in level classifications. The volatility in the market has stabilised in the course of 2020 and has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. In 2020, Financial Assets and Liabilities, including Level 3, continued to be valued using agreed methodologies and ING continued to limit the unobservable input to arrive at the most appropriate Fair Market value.",

        "page_content": "- >  38 Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\n## b) Valuation Control framework\n\nThe valuation control framework covers the product approval process (PARP), pricing, independent price verification (IPV), valuation adjustments including prudent valuation, and model use. Valuation processes are governed by various governance bodies, including Local Parameter Committees (LPC), Global Price Testing and Impairment Committee (GP&IC), Market Data Committee (MDC), Trading Pricing Model Committee (TPMC) and Model Risk Management Committee (MRMC). All relevant committees meet on a regular basis (monthly/quarterly), where agenda covers the aforementioned valuation controls.\n\nThe Global Price Testing and Impairment Committee is responsible for the oversight and the approval of the outcome of impairments (other than loan loss provisions) and valuation processes. It oversees the quality and coherence of valuation methodologies and performance. The TMPC is responsible for the approval of validating pricing and fair value models. The MRMC is responsible for the approval of the validated prudent valuation adjustment models and the Local Parameter Committee monitor the appropriateness of (quoted) pricing, any other relevant market info, as well as the appropriateness of pricing models themselves related to the fair valued positions to which they are applied. The LPC executes valuation methodology and processes at a local level. The Market Data Committee approves and reviews all pricing inputs for the calculation of market parameters.\n\nFinancial instruments measured by internal models where one or more unobservable market inputs are significant for valuation, a difference between the transaction price and the theoretical price resulting from the internal model can occur. ING defers the Day One profit and loss relating to financial instruments reported with significant unobservable valuation parameters, including positions classified as Level 3 in the Fair Value Hierarchy and trades related to CVA with material unobservable input but not necessarily classified as Level 3 in the Fair Value Hierarchy. The Day One profit and loss is amortised over the life of the instrument or until the observability changes. The impact on the profit and loss per year end 2020 is deemed to be immaterial. No Day one Profit and loss has been reserved for prior years. The Day one Profit and loss reserve is expected to grow over the coming years when new trades requiring a Day one Profit are reported.\n\n## c) Valuation Adjustments\n\nValuation adjustments are an integral part of the fair value. They are included as part of the fair value to provide better estimation of market exit value on measurement date. ING considers various valuation adjustments to arrive at the fair value including Bid-Offer adjustments, Model Risk adjustments, Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA), Debt valuation Adjustments (DVA), including DVA on derivatives and own issued liabilities and Collateral Valuation Adjustment (CollVA) and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA)'.\n\nThe following table presents the models reserves for financial assets and liabilities:\n\n| as at 31 December           |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bid/Offer                   |   -121 |   -140 |\n| Model Risk                  |    -25 |   -214 |\n| CVA                         |   -238 |   -223 |\n| DVA                         |   -124 |   -118 |\n| CollVA                      |    -16 |    -23 |\n| FVA                         |   -111 |    -76 |\n| Total Valuation Adjustments |   -634 |   -794 |\n\n## Bid-Offer Adjustment\n\nBid-Offer adjustments are required to adjust mid-market values to appropriate bid or offer value in order to best represent the exit value, and therefore fair value. It is applicable to financial assets and liabilities that are valued at mid-price initially. In practice this adjustment accounts for the difference in valuation from mid to bid and mid to offer for long and short exposures respectively. In principle assets are valued at the bid prices and liabilities are valued at the offer price. For certain assets or liabilities, where a market quoted price is not available, the price used is the fair value that is most representative within the bid-offer spread.\n\n## Model Risk Adjustment\n\nModel risk adjustments addresses the risk of possible financial losses resulting from the use of a misspecified, misapplied, or incorrect implementation of a model.",

In other words, it is the market value of counterparty credit risk. On the contrary, Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) reflects the credit risk of ING for its counterparty. CVA and DVA combinedly are regarded as the Bilateral Valuation Adjustment (BVA). The calculation of CVA is based on the estimation of the expected exposure, the counterparties' risk of default, and taking into account the collateral agreements as well as netting agreements. The counterparties' risk of default is measured by probability of default and expected loss given default, which is based on market information including credit default swap (CDS) spread. Where counterparty CDS spreads are not available, relevant proxy spreads are used. Additionally, wrong-way risk (when exposure to a counterparty is increasing and the credit quality of that counterparty deteriorates) and right-way risk (when exposure to a counterparty is increasing and the credit quality of that counterparty improves) are included in the adjustment\n\n## Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA)\n\nING recognises two types of Debit Valuation Adjustments, namely DVA on derivatives, as aforementioned and DVA on own issued financial liabilities. The application of DVA on own issued financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss, if the credit risk component has not been included in the prices. In this DVA calculation, the default probability of the institution are estimated based on the ING Funding spread.\n\n## Collateral Valuation Adjustment (CollVA)\n\nCollateral Valuation Adjustment is a derivative valuation adjustment capturing specific features of CSA (Credit Support Annex) with a counterparty that the regular valuation framework does not capture. Non-standard CSA features may include deviations in relation to the currency in which ING posts or receives collateral, deviations in remuneration rate on collateral which may pay lower or higher rate than overnight rate or even no interest at all. Other deviations can be posting securities rather than cash as collateral.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA)\n\nING applies an additional 'Funding Valuation Adjustment' (FVA) to address the funding costs associated with the collateral funding asymmetry on uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives in the portfolio. This adjustment is based on the expected exposure profiles of the uncollateralized or partially collateralized OTC derivatives and market-based funding spreads.\n\n## d) Fair value hierarchy\n\nING Group has categorised its financial instruments that are either measured in the statement of financial position at fair value or of which the fair value is disclosed, into a three level hierarchy based on the observability of the valuation inputs from (unadjusted) quoted prices. Highest priority is retained to (unadjusted) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to valuation techniques supported by unobservable inputs.\n\nTransfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels are made on a quarterly basis at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Level 1 -(Unadjusted) quoted prices in active markets\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is determined directly by reference to (unadjusted) quoted prices in an active market. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer markets, brokered markets, or principal to principal markets. Those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Transfers out of Level 1 into Level 2 or Level 3 occur when ING Group establishes that markets are no longer active and therefore (unadjusted) quoted prices no longer provide reliable pricing information.",

        "page_content": "- >  38 Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\n## Level 2 -Valuation technique supported by observable inputs\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is based on market observables other than (unadjusted) quoted prices. The fair value for financial instruments in this category can be determined by reference to quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, but for which the prices are modified based on other market observable external data or reference to quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active. These prices can be obtained from a third party pricing service. ING analyses how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid tradable prices or model based consensus prices taking various data as inputs.\n\nFor financial instruments that do not have a reference price available, fair value is determined using a valuation technique (e.g. a model), where inputs in the model are taken from an active market or are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.\n\nInstruments, where inputs are unobservable are classified in this category, provided that the impact of those unobservable inputs on the overall valuation is insignificant. The notion of significant is particularly relevant for the distinction between Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities. ING Group has chosen to align the definition of significance with the 90% confidence range as captured in the prudent value definition by EBA where possible. The same 90% confidence range is applied to model uncertainty. If the combined change in asset value resulting from the shift of the unobservable parameters and the model uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the asset is classified as Level 3. A value change below the threshold results in a Level 2 classification.\n\n## Level 3 -Valuation technique supported by unobservable inputs\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique (e.g. a model), for a significant part of the overall valuation is unobservable, or is determined by reference to price quotes where the market is considered inactive. Unobservable inputs are inputs which are based on the Group's own assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, developed based on the best information available in the market. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, spreads to discount rates, default rates and recovery rates, prepayment rates, and certain credit spreads. Transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels are made on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Methods applied in determining fair values of financial assets and liabilities (carried at fair value)\n\n|                                                                     |        |        | Level 1   | Level 1   |       |       | Level 3   | Level 3   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                     | 2020   | 2019   | 2020      | 2019      | 2020  | 2019  | 2020      | 2019      |\n| Financial Assets                                                    |        |        |           |           |       |       |           |           |\n| Financial assets at fair value  through profit or loss              |        |        |           |           |       |       |           |           |\n| - Equity securities                                                 | 7,897  | 8,508  | 2         | 2         | 138   | 148   | 8,037     | 8,657     |\n| - Debt securities                                                   | 3,378  | 4,963  | 4,867     | 3,441     | 1,269 | 919   | 9,514     | 9,323     |\n| - Derivatives                                                       | 1      |        | 30,623    | 23,797    | 197   | 154   | 30,821    | 23,951    |\n| - Loans and receivables                                             |        | -0     | 53,733    | 52,668    | 1,265 | 1,588 | 54,998    | 54,256    |\n|                                                                     | 11,276 | 13,471 | 89,225    | 79,909    | 2,870 | 2,807 | 103,370   | 96,187    |\n| Financial assets at fair value  through other comprehensive  income |        |        |           |           |       |       |           |           |\n| - Equity securities                                                 | 1,687  | 2,024  |           |           | 176   | 281   | 1,862     | 2,306     |\n| - Debt securities                                                   | 31,592 | 30,141 | 1,385     | 343       |       |       | 32,977    | 30,483    |\n| - Loans and receivables                                             |        |        |           |           | 1,056 | 1,680 | 1,056     | 1,680     |\n|                                                                     | 33,279 | 32,165 | 1,385     | 343       | 1,231 | 1,961 | 35,895    | 34,468    |\n| Financial liabilities                                               |        |        |           |           |       |       |           |           |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value  through profit or loss         |        |        |           |           |       |       |           |           |\n| -   Debt securities                                                 | 1,124  | 1,081  | 5,231     | 7,034     | 180   | 184   | 6,534     | 8,299     |\n| -   Deposits                                                        | 1      |        | 48,111    | 44,707    | 2     |       | 48,114    | 44,707    |\n| -   Trading securities                                              | 699    | 1,388  | 70        | 7         | 0     | -0    | 768       | 1,395     |\n| -   Derivatives                                                     | 55     | 58     | 27,094    | 23,176    | 217   | 305   | 27,365    | 23,540    |\n|                                                                     | 1,879  | 2,527  | 80,505    | 74,924    | 398   | 490   | 82,781    | 77,942    |\n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by ING Group to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments:\n\n## Equity securities\n\nInstrument description: Equity securities include stocks and shares, corporate investments and private equity investments.",

        "page_content": "- >  38 Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\nValuation: If available, the fair values of publicly traded equity securities and private equity securities are based on quoted market prices. In absence of active markets, fair values are estimated by analysing the investee's financial position, result, risk profile, prospect, price, earnings comparisons and revenue multiples. Additionally, reference is made to valuations of peer entities where quoted prices in active markets are available. For equity securities best market practice will be applied using the most relevant valuation method.  All non-listed equity investments, including investments in private equity funds, are subject to a standard review framework which ensures that valuations reflect the fair values. Fair value hierarchy: The majority of equity securities are publicly traded and quoted prices are readily and regularly available. Hence, these securities are classified as Level 1.  Equity securities which are not traded in active markets mainly include corporate investments, fund investments and other equity securities and are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nInstrument description: Debt securities include government bonds, financial institutions bonds and Asset-backed securities (ABS).\n\nValuation: Where available, fair values for debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices. Quoted market prices are obtained from an exchange market, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory service. The quoted prices from non-exchange sources are reviewed on their tradability of market prices. If quoted prices in an active market are not available, fair value is based on an analysis of available market inputs, which includes consensus prices obtained from one or more pricing services. Furthermore, fair values are determined by valuation techniques discounting expected future cash flows using a market interest rate curves, referenced credit spreads, maturity of the investment, and estimated prepayment rates where applicable.\n\nFair value hierarchy: Government bonds and financial institutions bonds are generally traded in active markets, where quoted prices are readily and regularly available and are hence, classified as Level 1. The remaining positions are classified as Level 2 or Level 3.  Asset backed securities for which no active market is available and a wide discrepancy in quoted prices exists, are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nInstrument description: Derivatives contracts can either be exchange-traded or over the counter (OTC). Derivatives include interest rate derivatives, FX derivatives, Credit derivatives, Equity derivatives and commodity derivatives.\n\nValuation: The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives is determined using quoted market prices in an active market and are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. For instruments that are not actively traded, fair values are estimated based on valuation techniques. OTC derivatives and derivatives trading in an inactive market are valued using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivatives and the nature of the underlying instruments. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are based on (amongst others) discounted cash flows option pricing models and Monte Carlo simulations. These valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based on 'no -arb itrage' principles. The models are commonly used in the financial industry and inputs to the validation models are determined from observable market data where possible. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market, but can be determined from observable prices via valuation model calibration procedures. These inputs include prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of pricing, yield curves, credit spreads, default rates, recovery rates, dividend rates, volatility of underlying interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates and reference is made to quoted prices, recently executed trades, independent market quotes and consensus data, where available.\n\nFor uncollateralised OTC derivatives, ING applies Credit Valuation Adjustment to correctly reflect the counterparty credit risk in the valuation. See section DVA/BVA in section b) Valuation Adjustments for more details regarding the calculation.\n\nFair value hierarchy: The majority of the derivatives are classified as Level 2. Derivatives for which the input cannot be implied from observable market data are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Loans and receivables\n\nInstrument description: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables carried at fair value includes trading loans, being securities lending and similar agreement comparable to collateralised lending, syndicated loans, loans expected to be sold and receivables with regards to reverse repurchase transactions.\n\nValuation: The fair value of loans and receivables are generally based on quoted market prices. The fair value of other loans is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects credit risk, liquidity, and other current market conditions. The fair value of mortgage loans is estimated by taking into account prepayment behaviour.",

        "page_content": "- >  38 Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\nFair value hierarchy: Loans and receivables are predominantly classified as Level 2. Loans and receivables for which current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs into a valuation model is not available are classified as Level 3 and are expected to be sold as Level 3.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss\n\nInstrument description: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss include debt securities,\n\ndebt instruments, primarily comprised of structured notes, which are held at fair value under the fair value option. Besides that, it includes derivative contracts and repurchase agreements. Valuation: The fair values of securities in the trading portfolio and other liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are based on quoted market prices, where available. For those securities not actively traded, fair values are estimated based on internal discounted cash flow valuation techniques using\n\ninterest rates and credit spreads that apply to similar instruments.\n\nFair value hierarchy: The majority of the derivatives are classified as Level 2. Derivatives for which the input cannot be derived from observable market data are classified as Level 3.\n\n## e) Transfers between Level 1 and 2\n\nNo significant transfers between Level 1 and 2 and no significant changes in the valuation techniques were recorded in the reporting period 2020.\n\n## f) Level 3: Valuation techniques and inputs used\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in Level 3 include both assets and liabilities for which the fair value was determined using (i) valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs as well as  (ii) quoted prices which have been adjusted to reflect that the market was not actively trading at or around the balance sheet date. Unobservable inputs are inputs which are based on ING's own assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, spreads to discount rates, default rates and recovery rates, prepayment rates, and certain credit spreads. Valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs are sensitive to the inputs used.\n\nOf the total amount of financial assets classified as Level 3 as at 31 December 2020 of EUR 4.1 billion (31 December 2019: EUR 4.8 billion), an amount of EUR 2.1 billion ( 52.3%) (31 December 2019: EUR 2.5\n\nbillion, being 52.6%) is based on unadjusted quoted prices in inactive markets. As ING does not generally adjust quoted prices using its ow n inputs, there is no significant sensitivity to ING's own unobservable inputs.\n\nFurthermore, Level 3 financial assets includes approximately EUR 0.9 billion (31 December 2019: EUR 1.3 billion) which relates to financial assets that are part of structures that are designed to be fully neutral in terms of market risk. Such structures include various financial assets and liabilities for which the overall sensitivity to market risk is insignificant. Whereas the fair value of individual components of these structures may be determined using different techniques and the fair value of each of the components of these structures may be sensitive to unobservable inputs, the overall sensitivity is by design not significant.\n\nThe remaining EUR 1.1 billion (31 December 2019: EUR 1.0 billion) of the fair value classified in Level 3 financial assets is established using valuation techniques that incorporates certain inputs that are unobservable.\n\nOf the total amount of financial liabilities classified as Level 3 as at 31 December 2020 of EUR 0.4 billion (31 December 2019: EUR 0.5 billion), an amount of EUR 0.1 billion (34.6%) (31 December 2019: EUR 0.2 billion, being 39.3%) is based on unadjusted quoted prices in inactive markets. As ING does not generally adjust quoted prices using i ts own inputs, there is no significant sensitivity to ING's own unobservable inputs.\n\nFurthermore, Level 3 financial liabilities includes approximately EUR 0.1 billion (31 December 2019: EUR 0.1 billion) which relates to financial liabilities that are part of structures that are designed to be fully neutral in terms of market risk. As explained above, the fair value of each of the components of these structures may be sensitive to unobservable inputs, but the overall sensitivity is by design not significant.\n\nThe remaining EUR 0.2 billion (31 December 2019: EUR 0.2 billion) of the fair value classified in Level 3 financial liabilities is established using valuation techniques that incorporates certain inputs that are unobservable.",

Inflation linked instruments protect against price inflation and are denominated and indexed to investment units. Interest payments would be based on the inflation index and nominal rate in order to receive/pay the real rate of return. A rise in nominal coupon payments is a result of an increase in inflation expectations, real rates, or both. As markets for these inflation linked derivatives are illiquid, the valuation parameters become unobservable.\n\n## Dividend yield\n\nDividend yield is an important input for equity option pricing models showing how much dividends a company is expected to pay out each year relative to its share price. Dividend yields are generally expressed as an annualised percentage of share price.\n\n## Jump rate\n\nJump rates simulate abrupt changes in valuation models. The rate is an added component to the discount rate in the model to include default risks.\n\n## Prepayment rate\n\nPrepayment rate is a key input to mortgage and loan valuation. Prepayment rate is the estimated rate at which mortgage borrowers will repay their mortgages early, e.g. 5% per year. Prepayment rate and reset spread are key inputs to mortgage linked prepayment swaps valuation\n\n## Price\n\nFor securities where market prices are not available fair value is measured by comparison with observable pricing data from similar instruments. Prices of 0% are distressed to the point that no recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of 100% or par are expected to pay a yield above current market rates.\n\n## Credit spreads\n\nCredit spread is the premium above a benchmark interest rate, typically LIBOR or relevant Treasury instrument, required by the market participant to accept a lower credit quality. Higher credit spreads indicate lower credit quality and a lower value of an asset.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure for variation of the price of a financial instrument or other valuation input over time. Volatility is one of the key inputs in option pricing models. Typically, the higher the volatility, the higher value of the option. Volatility varies by the underlying reference (equity, commodity, foreign currency and interest rates), by strike, and maturity of the option. The minimum level of volatility is 0% and there is no theoretical maximum.\n\n## Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of dependence between two underlying references which is relevant for valuing derivatives and other instruments having more than one underlying reference. High positive correlation (close to 1) indicates strong positive (statistical) relationship, where underliers move, everything else equal, move into the same direction. The same holds for a high negative correlation.\n\n## Reset spread\n\nReset spreads are key inputs to mortgage linked prepayment swaps valuation. Reset spread is the future spread at which mortgages will re-price at interest rate reset dates.",

Consequently, the portfolio of EUR 0.3 billion, which is classified at Level 3, was incorrectly measured at amortised cost and therefore\n\nreclassified to mandatorily fair value through profit or loss. Furthermore, it relates to ING's investme nt in Visa preference series C shares , reference is made to Note 5 'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income'.\n\nIn 2019 the amounts reported on the line reclassifications relate to syndicated loans reclassed from trading assets to financial assets mandatory at FVPL.",

This caused the valuation being significantly impacted by unobservable inputs.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, financial liabilities mainly (long term) repurchase transactions were transferred out of Level 3 mainly due to the valuation not being significantly impacted by unobservable inputs.\n\n## g) Recognition of unrealised gains and losses in Level 3\n\nAmounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss relating to unrealised gains and losses during the year that relates to Level 3 assets and liabilities are included in the line item 'Valuation results and net trading income' in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, unrealised gains and losses that relate to 'Financial assets at fair value through\n\nother comprehensive income' are included in the Revaluation r eserve -Equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income or Debt  Instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## h) Level 3: Sensitivity analysis of unobservable inputs\n\nWhere the fair value of a financial instrument is determined using inputs which are unobservable and which have a more than insignificant impact on the fair value of the instrument, the actual value of those inputs at the balance date may be drawn from a range of reasonably possible alternatives. In line with market practice the upper and lower bounds of the range of alternative input values reflect a 90% level of valuation certainty. The actual levels chosen for the unobservable inputs in preparing the financial statements are consistent with the valuation methodology used for fair valued financial instruments.\n\nIn practice valuation uncertainty is measured and managed per exposure to individual valuation inputs (i.e. risk factors) at portfolio level across different product categories. Where the disclosure looks at individual Level 3 inputs the actual valuation adjustments may also reflect the benefits of portfolio offsets.\n\nThis disclosure does not attempt to indicate or predict future fair value movement. The numbers in isolation give limited information as in most cases these Level 3 assets and liabilities should be seen in combination with other instruments (for example as a hedge) that are classified as Level 2.\n\nThe valuation uncertainty in the table below is broken down by related risk class rather than by product. The possible impact of a change of unobservable inputs in the fair value o of financial instruments where unobservable inputs are significant to the valuation is as follows:",

The fair value of other loans is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects credit risk, liquidity, and other current market conditions. The fair value of mortgage loans is estimated by taking into account prepayment behaviour. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for calculation purposes.\n\n## Deposits from banks\n\nThe fair values of payables to banks are generally based on quoted market prices or, if not available, on estimates based on discounting future cash flows using available market interest rates and credit spreads for payables to banks with similar characteristics.",

The fair values of deposits with fixed contractual terms have been estimated based on discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently applicable to deposits of similar maturities.\n\n## Debt securities in issue\n\nThe fair value of debt securities in issue is generally based on quoted market prices, or if not available, on estimated prices by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market interest rate and credit spreads applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity.\n\n## Subordinated loans\n\nThe fair value of publicly traded subordinated loans are based on quoted market prices when available. Where no quoted market prices are available, fair value of the subordinated loans is estimated using discounted cash flows based on interest rates and credit spreads that apply to similar instruments.\n\n## 39   Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\n## Use of derivatives\n\nING Group uses derivatives for economic hedging purposes to manage its asset and liability portfolios and structural risk positions. The primary objective of ING Group's hedging activities is to manage the risks which arises from structural imbalances in the duration and other profiles of its assets and liabilities. The objective of economic hedging is to enter into positions with an opposite risk profile to an identified risk exposure to reduce that exposure. The main risks which are being hedged are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. These risks are primarily hedged with interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards/swaps.\n\nING Group uses credit derivatives to manage its economic exposure to credit risk, including total return swaps and credit default swaps, to sell or buy protection for credit risk exposures in the loan, investment, and trading portfolios. Hedge accounting is not applied in relation to these credit derivatives.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS are classified and accounted for in accordance with the nature of the instrument hedged and the type of IFRS hedge model that is applicable. The three models applicable under IFRS are: fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, and hedge accounting of a net investment in a foreign operation. How and to what extent these models are applied are described under the relevant headings below. The company's detailed accounting policies for these three hedge models are set out in paragraph 1.7 'Financial instruments' of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and accounting policies'.\n\n## Impact of Covid-19\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 on timing or amount of cash flows of our products that are designated as hedged items in hedge accounting programs did not result in hedge ineffectiveness during the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "- >  39   Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\n## Impact of Brexit\n\nAs a result of Brexit and the associated uncertainty of the ability of United Kingdom based clearing houses to offer clearing services to European clients such as ING, ING has reduced its exposure to UK based clearing houses. In 2020 ING Group transferred part of the derivative exposures to an European Union based clearing house, which resulted in de-designation and re-designation of hedge accounting relationships.\n\nING Group migrated various portfolios of interest rate swaps, which were designated in both macro fair value hedges and macro cash flow hedges. For discontinued fair value hedges, the cumulative adjustment of EUR 3.2 billion arising from a hedging gain or loss on the hedged item is amortised through the statement of profit or loss over the remaining term of the original hedge.\n\nFor discontinued cash flow hedges, the fair value changes accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve of EUR 884 million remains in Other Comprehensive Income and is recycled to the statement of profit or loss in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. The de-designation and redesignation of these hedge accounting relationships did not result in material impact in the statement of profit or loss of 2020.\n\n## IBOR transition\n\nFollowing the decision by global regulators to seek alternatives for current critical benchmarks in use in various jurisdiction in order to comply with the EU Benchmarks Regulation, the IBOR transition program of ING was initiated in 2018 to prepare the Group for the reform.\n\nReference is made to note Risk management/ IBOR Transition for more information on to what rates ING is exposed and on how ING is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates. At the reporting date, ING Group assessed the extent to which hedge relationships are subject to uncertainties driven by the IBOR reform.\n\nING applies fair value and cash flow hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, and interest rate and foreign currency risks are designated as hedged risks in various micro and macro models.\n\nExcept for EONIA and EUR LIBOR all IBOR's in scope of ING's program are a component of either hedging instrument and/or hedged item where the interest rate and/or foreign currency risk are the designated hedged risk. The hedged exposures are mainly loan portfolios, issued debt securities and purchased debt instruments.\n\nING Group early adopted the amendments to IAS 39 issued in September 2019 to these hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform (Phase 1). This excludes EURIBOR hedges as EURIBOR is Benchmarks Regulation compliant.\n\nLIBOR indexed fair value and cash flow hedges are expected to be directly affected by the uncertainties arising from the IBOR reform. In particular, uncertainties over the timing and amount of the replacement rate may impact the effectiveness and highly probable assessment.\n\nFor these affected fair value and cash flow hedge relationships ING Group assumes that the LIBOR based cash flows from the hedging instrument and hedged item will remain unaffected. The same assumption is used while assessing the likelihood of occurrence of the forecast transactions that are subject to cash flow hedges. The cash flow hedges directly impacted by the IBOR reform still meet the highly probable requirement assuming the respective LIBOR benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based are not altered as a result of the reform.\n\nThe following table contains details of the gross notional amounts of hedging instruments as at 31 December that are used in the Group's hedge accounting relationships for which the Phase 1 amendments to IAS39 were applied:\n\n| Benchmark   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------|--------|--------|\n| USD LIBOR   | 41,020 | 45,496 |\n| GBP LIBOR   | 1,500  | 2,184  |\n| JPY LIBOR   | 410    | 2,922  |\n| CHF LIBOR   | 315    | 313    |\n\nApproximately 85% (31 December 2019: 68%) of the above notional amounts have a maturity date beyond 2021. In addition, approximately 63% of the above notional amounts for USD LIBOR have a maturity date beyond June 2023.",

Refer to sections 1.4.2 and 1.7.4. of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and accounting policies' for more information on the Phase 2 amendments.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nING Group 's fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments due to movements in market interest rates. ING Group 's approach to manage market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in 'Risk management -Market risk'. ING Group 's exposure to interest rate risk is disclosed in paragraph 'Interest rate risk in banking book'.\n\nBy using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, ING Group also exposes itself to credit risk of the derivative counterparty, which is not offset by the hedged item. ING Group minimises counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by clearing most of the derivatives through Central Clearing Counterparties. In addition ING Group only enters into transactions with high-quality counterparties and requires posting collateral.\n\nING Group applies fair value hedge accounting on micro level in which one hedged item is hedged with one or multiple hedging instruments as well as on macro level whereby a portfolio of items is hedged with multiple hedging instruments. For these macro hedges of interest rate risk ING applies the EU carveout. The EU 'carve -out' for macro hedging enables a group of derivatives (or proportions) to be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument and removes some of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting relating to hedging core deposits and under-hedging strategies. In retail operations, exposure on retail funding (savings and current accounts) and retail lending (mortgages) is initially offset. The remaining exposure is hedged in a portfolio hedge, using the EU carve-out, in which a portion of the retail lending portfolio and core deposits are designated as a hedged item for hedge accounting purposes.\n\nFor portfolio hedges the fair value is projected based on contractual terms and other variables including prepayment expectations. These projected fair value of the portfolios form the basis for identifying the notional amount subject to interest rate risk that is designated under fair value hedge accounting.\n\nMicro fair value hedge accounting is mainly applied on issued debt securities and purchased debt instruments for hedging interest rate risk.\n\nBefore fair value hedge accounting is applied by ING Group, ING Group determines whether an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument exists based on an evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk that is supported by quantitative analysis. ING Group considers whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. ING Group evaluates whether the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to similar risks. In addition ING is mainly using regression analysis to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nFor the macro hedge on the mortgage portfolio ING Group follows a dynamic hedging strategy. This means that on monthly basis, based on the new portfolio projection, the hedging relationship is renewed. From an operational point of view, the existing hedging relationship is adjusted based on the new portfolio projection and additional hedging instruments are added to the hedging relationship.\n\nING Group uses the following derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedge accounting relationship:\n\n## Gross carrying value of derivatives designated under fair value hedge accounting\n\n|                                          | Assets   2020   | Liabilities   2020   | Assets   2019   | Liabilities   2019   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| As at 31 December                        |                 |                      |                 |                      |\n| Hedging instrument on interest rate risk |                 |                      |                 |                      |\n| -  Interest rate swaps                   | 7,349           | 5,417                | 12,085          | 13,334               |\n| -  Other interest derivatives            | 50              | 110                  | 87              | 70                   |",

The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities, based on contractual terms and other variables including estimates of prepayments. These projected cash flows form the basis for identifying the notional amount subject to interest rate risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk that is designated under cash flow hedge accounting.\n\nING Group's approach to manage market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, is discussed in 'Risk management Credi t risk and Market risk'. ING Group determines the amount of the exposures to which it applies hedge accounting by assessing the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the future cash flows from its floating-rate assets and liabilities. This assessment is performed using analytical techniques.\n\nAs noted above for fair value hedges, by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, ING Group exposes itself to credit risk of the derivative counterparty, which is not offset by the hedged items. This exposure is managed similarly to that for fair value hedges.\n\nGains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated under cash flow hedge accounting are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. Interest cash flows on these derivatives are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 'Net interest income' consistent with the manner in which the forecasted cash flows affect net result. The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\nING Group determines an economic relationship between the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument based on an evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk that is supported by quantitative analysis. ING Group considers whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. ING Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to the hedged risk, such as the benchmark interest rate of foreign currency. In addition (for macro FX hedging relationships) a regression analysis is performed to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nING Group uses the following derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship:\n\n## Gross carrying value of derivatives used for cash flow hedge accounting\n\n|                                                          | 2020   | Assets  Liabilities  2020   | 2019   | Assets  Liabilities  2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|\n| As at 31 December                                        |        |                             |        |                             |\n| Hedging instrument on interest rate risk                 |        |                             |        |                             |\n| -  Interest rate swaps                                   | 2,271  | 545                         | 2,615  | 2,848                       |\n| Hedging instrument on FX rate risk                       |        |                             |        |                             |\n| Hedging instrument on combined interest and FX rate risk |        |                             |        |                             |\n| -  Cross currency interest rate derivatives              | 774    | 21                          | 358    | 158                         |",

The risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and ING Group's presentation currency, which causes the amount of the net investment to vary in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group. This risk may have a significant impact on ING Group's financial statements. ING Group's policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so it is expected to have a significant impact on the regulatory capital ratios of ING Group and its subsidiaries.\n\nING Group's net investment hedges principally consist of derivatives (including currency forwards and swaps) and non-derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency denominated funding. When the hedging instrument is foreign currency denominated debt, ING Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in the spot rate with past changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movement in the spot rate (the offset method).\n\nGains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated under net investment hedge accounting are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.  The balance in equity is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the related foreign subsidiary is disposed. The gains and losses on ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nING Group has the following derivative financial instruments used for net investment hedging;\n\n| Gross carrying value of derivatives used for net investment hedging   |      | Assets  Liabilities   |      | Assets   Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------|------|------------------------|\n|                                                                       | 2020 | 2020                  | 2019 | 2019                   |\n| As at 31 December                                                     |      |                       |      |                        |\n| -  FX forwards and Cross currency swaps                               | 69   | 98                    | 23   | 51                     |\n\nThe derivatives used for net investment hedge accounting are included in the statement of financial position lineitem 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Nontrading derivatives' EUR 69 million (2019: EUR 23 million) respectively 'Fin ancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss -Non trading derivatives' EUR 98 million (2019: EUR  51 million).

These balances are included in the maturity analysis as follows:\n\n- \uf0a0 Perpetual liabilities are included in column 'Maturity not applicable'.\n- \uf0a0 Derivative liabilities are included on a net basis if cash flows are settled net. For other derivative liabilities the contractual gross cash flow payable is included.\n- \uf0a0 Undiscounted future coupon interest on financial liabilities payable is included in a separate line and in the relevant maturity bucket.\n- \uf0a0 Non-financial liabilities are included based on a breakdown of the amounts per statement of financial position, per expected maturity.\n- \uf0a0 Loans and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.\n\nING Group's expected cash flows on some financial liabilities vary significantly from contractual cash flows. Principal differences are in demand deposits from customers that are expected to remain stable or increase and in unrecognised loan commitments that are not all expected to be drawn down immediately. Reference is made to the liquidity risk paragraph in 'Risk Management Funding and liquidity risk' for a description on how liquidity ris k is managed.",

They serve to secure margin accounts and are used for other purposes required by law. Pledges are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for collateralised transactions including standard sale and repurchase agreements, securities lending and borrowing and derivatives margining. The financial assets pledged are as follows:\n\n## Financial assets pledged as collateral\n\n|                                                       | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Banks                                                 |         |         |\n| -   Cash and balances with central banks              | 1,377   | 1,382   |\n| -   Loans and advances to banks                       | 3,833   | 6,337   |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss | 14,772  | 16,350  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through OCI            | 2,377   | 440     |\n| Securities at amortised cost                          | 7,023   | 1,118   |\n| Loans and advances to customers                       | 115,194 | 75,755  |\n| Other assets                                          | 761     | 908     |\n|                                                       | 145,338 | 102,290 |\n\nIn addition, in some jurisdictions ING Bank N.V. has an obligation to maintain a reserve with central banks.

Transferred financial assets that are derecognised in their entirety are mentioned in note 48 Structured Entities.\n\n## 43   Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe following tables include information about rights to offset and the related arrangements. The amounts included consist of all recognised financial instruments that are presented net in the statement of financial position under the IFRS netting criteria (legal right to offset and intention to net settle or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously) and amounts presented gross in the statement of financial position but subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements.\n\nAt ING Group amounts that are offset mainly relate to derivatives transactions, sale and repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and cash pooling arrangements. A significant portion of offsetting is applied to OTC derivatives which are cleared through central clearing parties.\n\nRelated amounts not set off in the statement of financial position include transactions where:\n\n- \u25aa The counterparty has an offsetting exposure and a master netting or similar arrangement is in place with a right to set off only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy, or the offsetting criteria are otherwise not satisfied, and\n- \u25aa In the case of derivatives and securities lending or sale and repurchase agreements, cash and non-cash collateral has been received or pledged to cover net exposure in the event of a default or other predetermined events. The effect of over-collateralisation is excluded.\n\nThe net amounts resulting after setoff are not intended to represent ING's actual exposure to counterparty risk, as risk management employs a number of credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral arrangements.

These products include traditional off-balance sheet creditrelated financial instruments.\n\n| Contingent liabilities and commitments   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Contingent liabilities in respect of     |         |         |\n| - Guarantees                             | 23,386  | 27,502  |\n| - Irrevocable letters of credit          | 14,016  | 16,340  |\n| - other                                  | 97      | 131     |\n|                                          | 37,499  | 43,974  |\n| Guarantees issued by ING Groep N.V.      | 292     | 319     |\n| Irrevocable facilities                   | 124,991 | 120,002 |\n|                                          | 162,782 | 164,296 |\n\nGuarantees relate both to credit and non-credit substitute guarantees. Credit substitute guarantees are guarantees given by ING Group in respect of credit granted to customers by a third party. Many of them are expected to expire without being drawn on and therefore do not necessarily represent future cash outflows.\n\nIrrevocable letters of credit mainly secure payments to third parties for a customer's foreign and domestic trade transactions in order to finance a shipment of goods. ING Group's credit risk i n these transactions is limited since these transactions are collateralised by the commodity shipped and are of a short duration.\n\nOther contingent liabilities include acceptances of bills and are of a short-term nature. Other contingent liabilities also include contingent liabilities resulting from the operations of the Real Estate business including obligations under development and construction contracts. Furthermore other contingent liabilities include a contingent liability in connection with a possible Dutch tax obligation that relates to the deduction from Dutch taxable profit for losses incurred by ING Bank in the United Kingdom in previous years. The existence of this obligation will be confirmed only by the occurrence of future profits in the United Kingdom.\n\nIrrevocable facilities mainly constitute unused portions of irrevocable credit facilities granted to corporate clients. Many of these facilities are for a fixed duration and bear interest at a floating rate. ING Group's credit risk and interest rate risk in these transactions is limited. The unused portion of irrevocable credit facilities is partly secured by customers' assets or counter -guarantees by the central governments and other public sector entities under the regulatory requirements. Irrevocable facilities also include commitments made to purchase securities to be issued by governments and private issuers.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, ING Groep N.V. guarantees various US dollar debentures (that mature between 2023 and 2036) which were issued by a subsidiary of Voya Financial Inc. In the Shareholder's agreement between ING Groep N.V. and Voya Financial Inc. it was agreed that the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the debentures shall be reduced to nil at 31 December 2019. In acc ordance with the Shareholder's agreement, the net exposure of ING Groep N.V. as at 31 December 2020 was nil, as the outstanding principal amount of the US dollar debentures was fully covered with collateral of EUR 304 million (2019: EUR 331 million) pledged by Voya Financial Inc.\n\nIn addition to the items included in contingent liabilities, ING Group has issued certain guarantees as participant in collective arrangements of national banking funds and as a participant in required collective guarantee schemes which apply in different countries. For example, ING Bank N.V. provided a guarantee to the German Deposit Guarantee Fund ('Einlagensicherungsfonds' or ESF) under section 5 (10) of the by-laws of this fund, where ING Bank N.V. indemnifies the Association of German Banks Berlin against any losses it might incur as result of actions taken with respect to ING Germany. The ESF is a voluntary collective guarantee scheme for retail savings and deposits in excess of EUR 100,000.",

        "page_content": "- >  45   Legal proceedings\n\n## 45   Legal proceedings\n\nING Group and its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations in the Netherlands and in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S., involving claims by and against them which arise in the ordinary course of their businesses, including in connection with their activities as lenders, broker-dealers, underwriters, issuers of securities and investors and their position as employers and taxpayers. In certain of such proceedings, very large or indeterminate amounts are sought, including punitive and other damages. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending or threatened governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations, ING is of the opinion that some of the proceedings and investigations set out below may have or have in the recent past had a significant effect on the financial position, profitability or reputation of ING and/or ING and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nSettlement agreement : On 4 September 2018, ING announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the Dutch Public Prosecution Service relating to previously disclosed investigations regarding various requirements for client on-boarding and the prevention of money laundering and corrupt practices. Following the entry into the settlement agreement, ING has experienced heightened scrutiny from authorities in various countries. ING is also aware, including as a result of media reports, that other parties may, among other things, seek to commence legal proceedings against ING in connection with the subject matter of the settlement, have filed or may file requests for disciplinary proceedings against ING empl oyees based on the Dutch 'Banker's oath', and/or have filed requests with the Court of Appeal in The Netherlands to reconsider the prosecutor's decision to enter into the settlement agreement with ING and not to prosecute ING or (former) ING employees. In December 2020, the Court of Appeal issued its final ruling. In this ruling the prosecutors' decision to enter into the settlement agreement with ING was upheld, making the settlement final. However, in a separate ruling, the Court ordered the prosecution o f ING's former CEO.\n\nFindings regarding AML processes : As previously disclosed, after its September 2018 settlement with Dutch authorities concerning anti-money laundering matters, and in the context of significantly increased attention on the prevention of financial economic crime, ING has experienced heightened scrutiny by authorities in various countries. The interactions with such regulatory and judicial authorities have included, and can be expected to continue to include, onsite visits, information re quests, investigations and other enquiries. Such interactions, as well as ING's internal assessments in connection with its global enhancement programme, have in some cases resulted in satisfactory outcomes, and also have resulted in, and may continue to result in, findings, or other conclusions which may require appropriate remedial actions by ING, or may have other consequences. ING intends to continue to work in close cooperation with authorities as it seeks to improve its management of non-financial risks in terms of policies, tooling, monitoring, governance, knowledge and behaviour.\n\nAlso as previously disclosed in March 2019, ING Italy was informed by the Banca d'Italia of their report containing their conclusions regarding shortcomings in AML processes at ING Italy, which was prepared based on an inspection conducted from October 2018 until January 2019. ING Italy has been engaged in discussions with Banca d'Italia and Italian judiciary authorities. In February 2020, the Court of Milan confirmed and approved a plea bargain agreement with the Italian judiciary authorities. As a consequence, ING Italy has paid an administrative fine and disgorgement of profit. In addition, in February 2020 the Banca d'Italia imposed an administrative fine on ING Italy. Bo th amounts were already provisioned for in 2019.\n\nIn September 2020, the Banca d'Italia announced that the ban on onboarding new customers at ING Italy, imposed in March 2019 has been removed. The decision follows the comprehensive steps undertaken by ING Italy to strengthen its processes and management of KYC compliance risks.\n\nING continues to take steps to enhance its management of compliance risks and embed stronger awareness across the whole organisation. These steps are part of the global KYC programme and set of initiatives, which includes enhancing KYC files and working on various structural improvements in compliance policies, tooling, monitoring, governance, knowledge and behaviour.",

        "page_content": "- >  45   Legal proceedings\n\nTax cases : Because of the geographic spread of its business, the Issuer may be subject to tax audits, investigations and procedures in numerous jurisdictions at any point in time. Although the Issuer believes that it has adequately provided for all its tax positions, the ultimate resolution of these audits, investigations and procedures is uncertain and may result in liabilities which are materially different from the amounts recognised.\n\nLitigation regarding products of a former subsidiary in Mexico : Proceedings in which ING is involved include complaints and lawsuits concerning the performance of certain interest sensitive products that were sold by a former subsidiary of ING in Mexico. A provision has been taken in the past.\n\nSIBOR -SOR litigation: In July 2016, investors in derivatives tied to the Singapore Interbank Offer Rate ('SIBOR') filed a U.S. class action complaint in the New York District Court alleging that several banks, including ING, conspired to rig the prices of derivatives tied to SIBOR and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate ('SOR'). The lawsuit refers to investigations by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS') and other regulators, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC'), in relation to rigging prices of SIBOR- and SOR based derivatives. In October 2018, the New York District Court issued a decision dismissing all claims against ING Group and ING Capital Markets LLC, but leaving ING Bank, together with several other banks, in the case, and directing plaintiffs to file an amended complaint consistent with the Court's rulings. In October 2018, plaintiffs filed such amended complaint, which asserts claims against a number of defendants but none against ING Bank (or any other ING entity), effectively dismissing ING Bank from the case. In December 2018, plaintiffs sought permission from the Court to file a further amended complaint that names ING Bank as a defendant. In July 2019, the New York District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and denied leave to further amend the complaint, effectively dismissing all remaining claims against ING Bank. In November 2019, plaintiffs filed an appeal against this judgment.\n\nClaims regarding accounts with predecessors of ING Bank Turkey: ING Bank Turkey has received numerous claims from (former) customers of legal predecessors of ING Bank Turkey. The claims are based on offshore accounts held with these banks, which banks were seized by the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund ('SDIF') prior to the acquisition of ING Bank Turkey in 2007 from OYAK. SDIF has also filed various lawsuits against ING Bank Turkey to claim compensation from ING Bank Turkey, with respect to amounts paid out to offshore account holders so far. At this moment it is not possible to assess the outcome of these procedures nor to provide an estimate of the (potential) financial effect of these claims.\n\nInterest rate derivatives claims : ING is involved in several legal proceedings in the Netherlands with respect to interest rate derivatives that were sold to clients in connection with floating interest rate loans in order to hedge the interest rate risk of the loans. These proceedings are based on several legal grounds, depending on the facts and circumstances of each specific case, inter alia alleged breach of duty of care, insufficient information provided to the clients on the product and its risks and other elements related to the interest rate derivatives that were sold to clients. In some cases, the court has ruled in favour of the claimants and awarded damages, annulled the interest rate derivative or ordered repayment of certain amounts to the claimants. The total amounts that need to be repaid or compensated in some cases still need to be determined. ING may decide to appeal against adverse rulings. Although the outcome of the pending litigation and similar cases that may be brought in the future is uncertain, it is possible that the courts may ultimately rule in favour of the claimants in some or all of such cases. Where appropriate a provision has been taken. The aggregate financial impact of the current and future litigation could become material.",

        "page_content": "- >  45   Legal proceedings\n\nAs requested by the AFM, ING has reviewed a significant part of the files of clients who bought interest rate derivatives. In December 2015, the AFM concluded that Dutch banks may have to re-assess certain client files, potentially including certain derivative contracts that were terminated prior to April 2014 or other client files. As advised by the AFM, the Minister of Finance appointed a Committee of independent experts (the 'Committee') which has established a uniform rec overy framework for Dutch SME clients with interest rate derivatives. ING has adopted this recovery framework and has reassessed individual files against this framework. ING has taken an additional provision for the financial consequences of the recovery framework. In 2017, ING has informed the majority of the relevant clients whether they are in scope of the recovery framework, and thus eligible for compensation, or not. Because implementation by ING of the uniform recovery framework encountered delay, ING has previously offered advance payments to customers out of the existing provision. As of December 2018, all customers in scope of the uniform recovery framework have received an offer of compensation from ING (including offers of no compensation). In June 2020, the independent derivative dispute committee rejected all claims by the client against ING in ING's last open file under the uniform recovery framework. The last open file has been closed at the end of June 2020.\n\nInterest surcharges claims: ING received complaints and was involved in litigation with certain individuals in the Netherlands regarding increases in interest surcharges with respect to several credit products, including but not limited to commercial property. ING has reviewed the relevant product portfolio. The provision previously taken has been reversed for certain of these complaints. All claims are dealt with individually. Thus far, the courts have ruled in favour of ING in each case, ruling that ING was allowed to increase the interest surcharge based upon the essential obligations in the contract. In a relevant case the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in favor of another Dutch bank, addressing the question whether or not a bank is allowed to increase interest surcharges unilaterally. The Supreme Court ruled affirmative. ING will continue to deal with all claims individually.\n\nCriminal proceedings regarding cash company financing: In June 2017, a Belgian criminal court ruled that ING Luxembourg assisted third parties in 2000 to commit a tax fraud in the context of the purchase of the shares of a cash company. The court convicted ING Luxembourg, among others, and ordered ING to pay a penal fine of EUR 120,000 (suspended for half of the total amount). The court also ordered ING Luxembourg jointly and severally with other parties, to pay EUR 31.48 million (together with any interest payable under applicable law) to the bankruptcy trustee of the cash company. In July 2017, ING Luxembourg filed an appeal against this judgment. A settlement with all the civil parties involved was reached in mid-2018. However, this settlement does not apply to the criminal conviction of ING Luxembourg. In January 2020, the Court of Appeal of Antwerp reformed the first judgment: ING Luxemburg benefitted from an \"opschorting van de uitspraak/suspension du prononc\u00e9\" which means that the conviction has been upheld, but no penal sanction has been pronounced (penalties suspended). The judgment is now final.\n\nMortgage expenses claims : ING Spain has received claims and is involved in procedures with customers regarding reimbursement of expenses associated with the formalisation of mortgages. In most court proceedings in first instance the expense clause of the relevant mortgage contract has been declared null and ING Spain has been ordered to reimburse all or part of the applicable expenses. The courts in first instance have applied in their rulings different criteria regarding the reimbursement of expenses. A provision has been taken and ING Spain has filed an appeal against a number of these court decisions. Since 2018, the Spanish Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice have issued rulings setting out which party should bear notary, registration, agency, and stamp duty costs. In January 2021, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that valuation costs of mortgages, signed prior to June 16, 2019, the date the new mortgage law entered into force, should be borne by the bank. The impact on ING was analysed and the provision mentioned above was adjusted. ING Spain has also been included, together with other Spanish banks, in three class actions filed by customer associations. In one of the class actions an agreement was reached with the association. In another class action ING filed an appeal asking the Spanish Court of Appeal to determine that the ruling of the court of first instance is only applicable to the consumers that were part of the case.",

('Imtech'). Furthermore, on 28 March 2018, ING Bank received another claim on the same subject matter from the Dutch Associati on of Stockholders (Vereniging van Effectenbezitters, 'VEB'). Each of the claimants allege inter alia that shareholders were misled by the prospectus of the rights issues of Imtech in July 2013 and October 2014. ING Bank, being one of the underwriters of the rights issues, is held liable by the claimants for the damages that investors in Imtech would have suffered. ING Bank responded to the claimants denying any and all responsibility in relation to the allegations made in the relevant letters. In September 2018, the trustees in the bankruptcy of Imtech claimed from various financing parties, including ING, payment of what the security agent has collected following bankruptcy or intends to collect, repayment of all that was repaid to the financing parties, as well as compensation for the repayment of the bridge financing. At this moment it is not possible to assess the outcome of these claims nor to provide an estimate of the (potential) effect of these claims.\n\nMexican Government Bond litigation: A class action complaint was filed adding ING Bank N.V., ING Groep N.V., ING Bank Mexico S.A. and ING Financial Markets LLC ('ING') as defendants to a complaint that had previously been filed against multiple other financial institutions. The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to fix the prices of Mexican Government Bonds. ING is defending itself against the allegations. Currently, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the (potential) financial effect of this claim. On 30 September 2019, the relevant court dismissed the antitrust complaint, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to identify any facts that links each defendant to the alleged conspiracy. On 9 December 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint removing all ING entities as defendants on the condition that the ING entities enter into a tolling agreement for the duration of two years. The relevant ING entities subsequently entered into a tolling agreement, which provides that the statute of limitations will not be tolled for the two-year duration of the agreement. Should the plaintiffs discover any evidence of potential involvement by ING in the activities alleged in the complaint, ING could be brought back into the litigation.\n\n## 46   Consolidated companies and businesses acquired and divested\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2020.\n\nIn May 2019 ING acquired 80% of the shares of Intersoftware Group B.V., Findata Access B.V. and Unitrust B.V. (ISW Group) for a total consideration of EUR 18 million. The acquisition of ISW Group resulted in the recognition of goodwill of EUR 17 million.\n\nIn 2018 ING Bank obtained control over Payvision Holding B.V. (Payvision) by acquiring 75% of its shares. The share purchase agreement included a put option exercisable by the original shareholders and a call option exercisable by ING for the remaining 25% shares. The put and call option led to the recognition of a financial liabili ty with initial recognition through shareholders' equity of EUR 87 million. In November 2019 ING Bank agreed to purchase the remaining 25% shares in three tranches between November 2019 and April 2020 for a total consideration of EUR 90 million. This resulted in the remeasurement of the financial liability to EUR 90 million. A stake of 23% was purchased in 2019 which reduced the outstanding financial liability and on 30 April 2020 ING purchased the remaining stake of 2%. As at 31 December 2020 the ownership interest of ING Bank was 100%. Given that ING Bank already had control over Payvision, the acquisition of the shares in 2020 represents a shareholder transaction and resulted in a transfer between Non-controlling interest and Shareholders equity of EUR 1 million.\n\n## Divestments\n\nThere were no significant divestments in 2020",

        "page_content": "- >  47   Principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nIn July 2019 ING completed the sale of part of the ING Lease Italy business. The settlement price amounted to EUR 1,162 million, consisted of a EUR 368 million cash settlement, a EUR 20 million Deferred Purchase Price and a EUR 774 million Senior Loan facility for the portfolio of lease receivables. The deferred purchase price is linked to the performance of the sold portfolio and is reported under the financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss. The additional loss in 2019 amounted EUR -2 million (2018: EUR -123 million).

For subsidiaries in which the interest held is below 50%, control exists based on the combination of ING's financial interest and its rights from other contractual arrangements which result in control over the operating and financial policies of the entity.\n\nFor each of the subsidiaries listed, the voting rights held equal the proportion of ownership interest and consolidation by ING is based on the majority of ownership.\n\nFor the principal investments in associates and joint ventures ING Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, but also the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies through situations including, but not limited to one or more of the following:\n\n- \u25aa Representation on the board of directors;\n- \u25aa Participation in the policymaking process; and\n- \u25aa Interchange of managerial personnel.\n\nThe principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures of ING Groep N.V. and their statutory place of incorporation or primary place of business are as follows:\n\n## Principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures\n\n|                                               |                                             |                          | Proportion of  ownership and  interest held  by the group   | Proportion of  ownership and  interest held  by the group   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                               |                                             |                          | 2020                                                        | 2019                                                        |\n| Subsidiary                                    | Statutory place of  Incorporation           | Country of operation     |                                                             |                                                             |\n| ING Bank N.V.                                 | Amsterdam                                   | the Netherlands          | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| Bank Mendes Gans N.V.                         | Amsterdam                                   | the Netherlands          | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING Belgium S.A./N.V.                         | Brussels                                    | Belgium                  | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING Luxembourg S.A.                           | Luxembourg City                             | Luxembourg               | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING-DiBa AG                                   | Frankfurt am Main                           | Germany                  | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING Bank Slaski S.A. 1                        | Katowice                                    | Poland                   | 75%                                                         | 75%                                                         |\n| ING Financial Holdings Corporation Delaware   | ING Financial Holdings Corporation Delaware | United States of America | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING Bank A.S.                                 | Istanbul                                    | Turkey                   | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING Bank (Australia) Ltd                      | Sydney                                      | Australia                | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING Commercial Finance B.V.                   | Amsterdam                                   | the Netherlands          | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| ING Groenbank N.V.                            | Amsterdam                                   | the Netherlands          | 100%                                                        | 100%                                                        |\n| Investments in associates and  joint ventures |                                             |                          |                                                             |                                                             |\n| TMB Bank Public Company Ltd 2                 | Bangkok                                     | Thailand                 | 23%                                                         | 23%                                                         |",

A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. ING Group's involvement in these entities varies and includes both debt financing and equity financing of these entities as well as other relationships. Based on its accounting policies, as disclosed in the section Principles of valuation and determination of results of these financial statements, ING establishes whether these involvements result in no significant influence, significant influence, joint control or control over the structured entity.\n\nThe structured entities over which ING can exercise control are consolidated. ING may provide support to these consolidated structured entities as and when appropriate. However, this is fully reflected in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group as all assets and liabilities of these entities are included and off-balance sheet commitments are disclosed.\n\nING's activities involving structured entities are explained below in the following categories:\n\n- 1. Consolidated ING originated securitisation programmes;\n- 2. Consolidated ING originated Covered bond programme (CBC);\n- 3. Consolidated ING sponsored Securitisation programme (Mont Blanc);\n- 4. Unconsolidated Securitisation programme; and\n- 5. Other structured entities.\n\n## 1. Consolidated ING originated securitisation programmes\n\nING Group enters into liquidity management securitisation programmes in order to obtain funding and improve liquidity. Within the programme ING Group sells ING originated assets to a structured entity. The underlying exposures include residential mortgages in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Australia and SME Loans in Belgium.\n\nThe structured entity issues securitised notes (traditional securitisations) which are eligible collateral for central bank liquidity purposes. In most programmes ING Group acts as investor of the securitised notes. ING Group continues to consolidate these structured entities if it is deemed to control the entities.\n\nThe structured entity issues securitisation notes in two or more tranches, of which the senior tranche obtains a high rating (AAA or AA) by a rating agency. The tranche can subsequently be used by ING Group as collateral in the money market for secured borrowings.\n\nING Group originated various securitisations, as at 31 December 2020, these consisted of approximately EUR 66 billion (2019: EUR 57 billion) of senior and subordinated notes, of which approximately EUR 2 billion (2019: EUR 4 billion) were issued externally. The underlying exposures are residential mortgages and SME loans. Apart from the third party funding, these securitisations did not impact ING Group's Consolidated statement of financial position and profit or loss.\n\nIn 2020, there are no non-controlling interests as part of the securitisation structured entities that are significant to ING Group. ING Group for the majority of the securitisation vehicles provides the funding for the entity except for EUR 2 billion (2019: EUR 4 billion).\n\nIn addition ING Group originated various securitisations for liquidity management optimisation purposes. As at 31 December 2020, these consisted of approximately EUR 2 billion (2019: EUR 2 billion) of senior secured portfolio loans, which have been issued to ING subsidiaries in Germany. The underlying exposures are senior loans to large corporations and financial institutions, and real estate finance loans, mainly in the Netherlands. These securitisations did not impact ING Group's consolidated statement of financial position and profit or loss.\n\n## 2. Consolidated ING originated Covered bond programme (CBC)\n\nING Group has entered into a covered bond programme. Under the covered bond programme ING issues bonds. The payment of interest and principal is guaranteed by the ING administered structured entities, ING Covered Bond Company B.V., and ING SB Covered Bond Company B.V. In order for these entities to fulfil their guarantee, ING legally transfers mainly Dutch mortgage loans originated by ING. Furthermore ING offers protection against deterioration of the mortgage loans. The entities are consolidated by ING Group.",

Consolidated ING sponsored Securitisation programme (Mont Blanc)\n\nIn the normal course of business, ING Group structures financing transactions for its clients by assisting them in obtaining sources of liquidity by selling the clients' receivables or other financial assets to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The senior positions in these transactions may be funded by the ING administered multi seller Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) conduit Mont Blanc Capital Corp. (rated A-1/P-1). Mont Blanc Capital Corp. funds itself externally  in the ABCP markets.\n\nIn its role as administrative agent, ING Group facilitates these transactions by acting as administrative agent, swap counterparty and liquidity provider to Mont Blanc Capital Corp. ING Group also provides support facilities (i.e. liquidity) backing the transactions funded by the conduit. The types of asset currently in the Mont Blanc conduit include trade receivables, consumer finance receivables, car leases and residential mortgages.\n\nING Group supports the commercial paper programmes by providing Mont Blanc Capital Corp. with short-term liquidity facilities. Once drawn these facilities bear normal credit risk.\n\nThe liquidity facilities, provided to Mont Blanc are EUR 2,793 million (2019: EUR 1,631 million). The drawn liquidity amount is nil as at 31 December 2020 (2019: nil).\n\nThe standby liquidity facilities are reported under irrevocable facilities. All facilities, which vary in risk profile, are granted to the Mont Blanc Capital Corp. subject to normal ING Group credit and liquidity risk analysis procedures. The fees received for services provided and for facilities are charged subject to market conditions.\n\n## 4. Unconsolidated Securitisation programme\n\nIn 2013 ING transferred financial assets (mortgage loans) for an amount of approximately EUR 2 billion to a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The transaction resulted in full derecognition of the financial assets from ING's statement of financial position. Following this transfer ING continues to have two types of on-going involvement in the transferred assets: as counterparty to the SPE of a non-standard interest rate swap and as servicer of the transferred assets. ING has an option to unwind the transaction by redeeming all notes at their principal outstanding amount, in the unlikely event of changes in accounting and/or regulatory requirements that significantly impact the transaction. The fair value of the swap held by ING at 31 December 2020 amounted to EUR -34 million (2019: EUR -45 million); fair value changes on this swap recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 2020 were EUR 11 million (2019: EUR 12 million). Service fee income recognised, for the role as administrative agent, in the statement of profit or loss in 2020 amounted to EUR 1 million (2019: EUR 2 million). The cumulative income recognised in profit or loss since derecognition amounts to EUR 16 million (2019: EUR 15 million).\n\n## 5. Other structured entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, ING Group enters into transactions with structured entities as counterparty. Predominantly in its structured finance operations, ING can be instrumental in facilitating the creation of these structured entity counterparties. These entities are generally not included in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group, as ING facilitates these transactions as administrative agent by providing structuring, accounting, funding, lending, and operation services.\n\nING Group offers various investment fund products to its clients. ING Group does not invest in these investment funds for its own account nor acts as the fund manager.",

        "page_content": "- >  51  Capital management\n\n## 51  Capital management\n\n## Objectives\n\nGroup Treasury ('GT') Balance Sheet & Capital Management, is responsible for maintaining the adequate capitalisation of ING Group and ING Bank entities, to manage the risk associated with ING's business activities. This involves not only managing, planning and allocating capital within ING Group, ING Bank and its various entities, but also helping to execute necessary capital market transactions, term (capital) funding and risk management transactions. ING takes an integrated approach to assess the adequacy of its capital position in relation to its risk profile and operating environment. This means GT Balance Sheet & Capital Management takes into account both regulatory and internal, economic based metrics and requirements as well as the interests of key stakeholders such as shareholders and rating agencies.\n\nING applies the following main capital definitions:\n\n- \uf0a0 Common equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) is defined as shareholders' equity less regulatory adjustments. CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the CET1 ratio.\n- \uf0a0 Tier 1 capital -is defined as CET1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 (hybrid) securities and other regulatory adjustments. Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the Tier 1 capital ratio.\n- \uf0a0 Total capital -is Tier 1 capital plus subordinated Tier 2 liabilities and regulatory adjustments. Total capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the Total capital ratio.\n- \uf0a0 Common equity Tier 1 ratio ambition -is built on the CET1 requirements specified for ING, uncertainty of expected regulatory RWA inflation, potential increase in the regulatory requirement of the Countercyclical Buffer and the potential impact of a standardised and predetermined 1-in-10-year stress event (i.e. at a 90% confidence level with a 1-year horizon).\n- \uf0a0 Leverage ratio (LR) -is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage exposure.\n\n## Capital developments\n\nOur capital position remained strong despite the higher risk costs due to Covid-19. At both the consolidated and entity level, ING has sufficient buffers to withstand certain adverse scenarios without breaching regulatory requirements in a forward looking scenario.\n\nIn 2020, ING has changed its CET1 ambition from around 13.5% to around 12.5%, reflecting among others a structural reduction of capital requirements and increased visibility of expected regulatory RWA inflation. This new ambition level is still comfortably above the current Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) level of 10.51%, implying a management buffer of ~200 basis points.\n\nING's capital ratios at the end of the year improved compared to 2019 primarily due to lower risk -weighted assets, mainly driven by lower volumes, FX movements and improved lending book quality. On the latter, downward rating adjustments were more than offset by higher and additional collateral value. ING continues to maintain a strong and high quality capital level.\n\nING Groep N.V. has a Common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.5% as at 31 December 2020 versus an overall CRR II / CRD V solvency requirement ( including buffer requirements) of 10.51%. The Group's Tier 1 ratio (including grandfathered securities) increased to 17.3%. The Total capital ratio (including grandfathered securities) increased from 19.1% to 20.1% compared to last year.\n\nING Bank N.V. has a CET1 ratio of 14.0%, versus an overall CRR II / CRD V solvency requirement (including buffer requirements) of 8.14%. ING Bank will pay EUR 1,207 million of dividend to ING Group in relation to  2020 profit. The Tier 1 ratio (including grandfathered securities) increased from 15.1% to 15.9%, primarily reflecting developments in ING Bank's CET1 ratio. The Banks's total capital ratio (including grandfathered securities) increased from 17.9% to 19.0%.",

The latter to be considered periodically, taking into account alternative opportunities as well as macroeconomic circumstances and the outcome of our capital planning. Resilient net profit is defined as net profit adjusted for significant items not linked to the normal course of business. The 50% payout may be in the form of cash or a combination of cash and share repurchases.\n\nFor 2020, the resilient net profit amounts to EUR 3,025 million of which EUR 1,512 million is reserved for distribution outside of CET1 capital. The resilient net profit includes EUR 540 million of positive P&L adjustments to the IFRS-EU net result related to impairments on goodwill (EUR 310 million) and the TMB stake (EUR 230 million). In February 2021, ING paid a cash-only interim dividend of EUR 468 million (EUR 0.12 per share). This amount is equal to 15% of adjusted net profit for 2020, in line with the ECB recommendation of 15 December 2020, which included a definition of adjusted net profit. At the end of 2020 and including the final 2019 dividend, ING has reserved EUR 3,266 million for distribution. This includes EUR 468 million of cash-only 2020 interim dividend and the remainder, subject to prevailing ECB recommendation, for distribution after September 2021.\n\n## Processes for managing capital\n\nGT Balance Sheet & Capital Management ensures adherence to the set limits and targets by planning and executing capital management transactions. The ongoing assessment and monitoring of capital adequacy is embedded in the capital planning process within the ICAAP framework. As part of the dynamic business planning process, ING prepares a capital and funding plan on a regular basis for all its material businesses and assesses continuously the timing, need and feasibility for capital management actions in scope of its execution strategy. Sufficient financial flexibility should be preserved to meet important f inancial objectives. ING's risk appetite statements set targets and are at the foundation of the capital plan. These limits are cascaded to the different businesses in line with our risk management framework. Contingency capital measures and early warning indicators are in place in conjunction with ING's recovery plan to support the strategy in times of stress.\n\nAdverse planning and stress testing, which reflect the outcomes of the annual risk assessment, are integral components of ING's risk and capital ma nagement framework. It allows us to (i) identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in our businesses, business model, portfolios or operating environment; (ii) understand the sensitivities of the core assumptions used in our strategic and capital plans; and (iii) improve decision-making and business steering through balancing risk and return following a forward looking and prudent management approach.\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nCapital adequacy and the use of required regulatory capital are based on the guidelines developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (The Basel Committee) and the European Union Directives, as implemented by the Dutch Central Bank (Dutch Central Bank until 3 November 2014, the ECB thereafter) for supervisory purposes. In 2010, the Basel Committee issued new solvency and liquidity requirements that superseded Basel II, implemented in the EU via CRR / CRD. In accordance with the CRR the minimum Pillar 1 capital requirements applicable to ING Group are: a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 ratio of 6% and a Total capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nIn 2020, as a reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, relevant regulators introduced a number of changes to the regulatory capital requirements applicable to ING, including structural reductions. The structural reductions of capital requirements reflect the application of Art.104a in CRD V, which allowed ING to replace CET1 capital with additional Tier 1 / Tier 2 securities to meet the Pillar II requirement, and a reduction in the overall systemic buffer (i.e. the Systemic Risk Buffer plus the highest of the O-SII and GSII buffer) by the Dutch National Bank from 3% to 2.5%. Similarly, various competent authorities changed or removed their Countercyclical Buffer (CCyB) requirements reducing the CCyB for ING from 24 basis points to 3 basis points.\n\nAs a consequence, the overall CET1 requirement (including buffer requirements) for ING Group at a consolidated level was 10.51% in 2020. This requirement is the sum of a 4.5% Pillar I requirement, a 0.98% Pillar II requirement, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), a 0.03% Countercyclical Buffer (CCyB) (based on December 2020 positions) and a 2.5% O-SII buffer that is set separately for Dutch systemic banks by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank). This requirement excludes the Pillar II guidance, which is not disclosed.",

In the event that ING Group breaches the MDA level, ING may face restrictions on dividend payments, AT1 instruments coupons and payment of variable remuneration.\n\n## Ratings\n\nING's key credit ratings and outlook are shown in the table above.

In accordance with subsection 8 of section 362, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the recognition and measurement principles applied in these Parent company financial statements are the same as those applied in the Consolidated financial statements, reference is made to Note 1 'Accounting policies' of the Consolidated financial statements. Investments in Group companies are accounted for in the Parent company accounts according to the equity method. In addition to the notes to these financial statements, further information is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nA list containing the information referred to in Section 379 (1), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code has been filed with the office of the Commercial Register of Amsterdam, in accordance with Section 379 (5), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe parent company financial statements are presented in euros, rounded to the nearest million, unless stated otherwise. Amounts may not add up due to rounding.\n\n## Parent company equity and related reserves\n\nThe total amount of equity in the Parent c ompany financial statements equals Shareholders' equity (parent) in the consolidated financial statements. Certain components within equity are different as a result of the following presentation differences between the parent company accounts and consolidated accounts:\n\n- \u25aa Unrealised revaluations within consolidated Group companies, presented in Other reserves Revaluation reserve in the consolidated accounts, are presented in the Share of participating interests reserve in the parent company accounts;\n- \u25aa The reserve for cash flow hedges within consolidated Group companies, presented in Other reserves -Revaluation reserve in the consolidated accounts is included in the Share of participating interests reserve, in the parent company accounts on a net basis.\n- \u25aa Foreign currency translation on consolidated Group companies, presented in Other reserves Currency translation reserve in the consolidated accounts, is presented in the Share of participating interests reserve in the parent company accounts.\n\nA legal reserve is carried at an amount equal to the share in the results of participating interests since their first inclusion at net asset value less the amount of profit distributions to which rights have accrued in the interim. Profit distributions which can be repatriated to the Netherlands without restriction are likewise deducted from the Share of participating interests reserve.",

(the 'Company' or 'ING Group') based in Amsterdam. The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- 1 the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;\n- 2 the following consolidated statements for 2020: the statement of profit or loss, the statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows; and\n- 3 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nThe parent company financial statements comprise:\n\n- 1 the parent company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020;\n- 2 the parent company statement of profit or loss and statement of changes in equity for 2020; and\n- 3 the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n## Basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are independent of ING Groep N.V. in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' ('ViO', Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in The Netherlands.

        "page_content": "Contents Introduction\n\nStrategy and performance\n\n- > Independent auditor's report\n\n## Materiality\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at EUR 250 million (2019: EUR 300 million) which represents 5.7% (2019: profit before taxation from continuing operation 4.4%) of normalised profit before taxation from continuing operations. The materiality is determined with reference to the normalised profit before taxation from continuing operations and excludes goodwill impairment (EUR 310 million) and impairment of associates and joint ventures (EUR 235 million).\n\nWe consider normalised profit before taxation from continuing operations as the most appropriate benchmark based on our assessment of the general information needs of users of financial statements and given the fact that ING Group is a profit-oriented entity. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 12.5 million (2019: EUR 15 million) which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nING Group is at the head of a group of components. The financial information of this group is included in the financial statements of ING Group.\n\nING Group is structured in segments: Retail Netherlands, Retail Belgium, Retail Germany, Retail Other, Wholesale Banking and Corporate Line Banking, covering different countries. Because we are ultimately responsible for the group audit engagement, we are responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for components. Our group audit is mainly focused on significant components. These components are either individually financially significant due to their relative size compared to ING Group or because we identified a significant risk of material misstatement to one or more account balances of these entities. In addition, we included certain other non-significant components in the scope of our group audit in order to arrive at a sufficient coverage over all relevant significant account balances.\n\nApplying these scoping criteria led to a full or specific scope audit for 42 components globally, in total covering 16 countries. This resulted in a coverage performed by component auditors of 83% of profit before taxation from continuing operations and 92% of total assets. For the remaining 17% of profit before taxation from continuing operations and 8% of total assets, procedures were performed by the group audit team. The consolidation of ING Group, the disclosures in the financial statements and certain accounting topics that are performed at group level, are audited by the group audit team. Procedures that are performed by the group audit team include, but are not limited to, substantive procedures with respect to equity, goodwill, certain elements of the Expected Credit Loss provisioning process, and analytical procedures in order to corroborate our assessment that the risk of material misstatement in the residual population is less than reasonably possible and scoping remained appropriate throughout the audit.\n\nAll components in scope for group reporting are audited by KPMG member firms. We sent detailed instructions to all component auditors, covering significant areas including the relevant significant risks of material misstatement identified at group level, and set out the information required to be reported to the group audit team. We performed file reviews for The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore and Turkey. The Covid-19 travel implications required us to perform the file reviews remotely. For all components in scope of the group audit, we held conference calls and/or remote meetings with the auditors of the components. During these meetings and calls, the planning, risk assessment, procedures performed, findings and observations reported to the group auditor were discussed in more detail and any further work deemed necessary by the group audit team was then performed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn view of restrictions on the movement of people across borders, and also within significantly affected countries, we have considered making changes to the planned audit approach to evaluate the component auditors' communications and the adequacy of their work. Due to the aforementioned restrictions, visiting components was not practicable in the current environment. As a result, we have requested those component auditors to provide us with access to audit workpapers to perform these evaluations, subject to local law and regulations. In addition, due to the inability to arrange in-person meetings with such component auditors, we have increased the use of alternative methods of communication with them, including through written instructions, exchange of e-mails and virtual meetings.\n\nThe group audit team set component materiality levels which ranged from EUR 20 million to EUR 95 million, based on the mix of size and financial statement risk profile of the components within the group to reduce the aggregation risk to an acceptable level.\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at group components, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about ING Group's financial information to provide an opinion about the financial statements.\n\nThe audit coverage as stated in the section summary can be further specified as follows:\n\nTotal assets\n\n92%\n\n8%\n\nCovered by audit procedures performed by component auditors\n\nCovered by procedures performed at group level\n\nProfit before taxation from continuing operations\n\n83%\n\n17%\n\nCovered by audit procedures performed by component auditors\n\nCovered by procedures performed at group level",

We refer to section Risk Management of the Annual Report where the Executive Board included its risk assessment, and section Corporate Governance where the Supervisory Board reflects on this.\n\n## Our risk assessment\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to for example financial reporting fraud and misappropriation of assets. We, together with our forensics specialists, evaluated the fraud risk factors to consider whether those factors indicated a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\nIn addition, we performed procedures to obtain an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Company and we inquired the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board as to whether the entity is in compliance with such laws and regulations and inspected correspondence, if any, with relevant licensing and regulatory authorities DNB and ECB.\n\nThe potential effect of the identified laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the Company is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements, including taxation and financial reporting. We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items and, therefore, no additional audit response is necessary.\n\nSecondly, the Company is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have an indirect material effect on amounts recognised or disclosures provided in the financial statements, or both, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an indirect effect:\n\n- -  Anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\n- -  Sanctions laws.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance with the auditing standard, we evaluated the following fraud and non-compliance risks that are relevant to our audit, including the relevant presumed risks:\n\n- -  Fraud risk in relation to management override of controls (a presumed risk).\n- -  Fraud risk in relation to management override of Expected Credit Loss provision results.\n\nWe rebutted the presumed fraud risk on revenue recognition, as the accounting of interest income and commission income is based on automatically generated accruals based on static data taken from the loan source system and therefore concerns routine transactions not subject to management judgement.\n\nWe communicated the identified risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of fraud and/or non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to component audit teams of relevant risks of fraud and/or non-compliance with laws and regulations identified at group level.\n\nIn all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We refer to the Key Audit Matters 'Assessment of Expected Credit Losses on loans and advances to customers and banks' and 'Assessment of goodwill impairment' that are examples of our approach related to areas of higher risk due to accounting estimates where management makes significant judgements.\n\nWe communicated our risk assessment and audit response to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Our audit procedures differ from a specific forensic fraud investigation, which investigation often has a more in-depth character.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures (not limited) to respond to the assessed risks:\n\n- -  We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks.\n- -  We performed data analysis of high-risk journal entries and evaluated key estimates and judgements for bias by the Company, including retrospective reviews of prior year's estimates. We also performed substantive testing including testing of transactions back to source information.\n- -  We assessed matters reported on the Company's whistleblowing and complaints procedures with the entity and assessed, where deemed necessary, results of management's follow-up of such matters.\n- -  With respect to the risk of fraud in relation to management override of Expected Credit Loss provision results, we refer to the Key Audit Matter 'Assessment of Expected Credit Losses on loans and advances to customers and banks'.\n- -  We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit.\n- -  We considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings or misstatements were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n- -  We obtained audit evidence regarding compliance with the provisions of those laws and regulations generally recognised to have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.",

We instructed local auditors of selected components of ING Group to assess the progress of the remediation at component level.\n\nWe observe that the required KYC enhancement program receives and will need ongoing attention from management, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nWe do note that our audit is not primarily designed to detect fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations and that management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to errors or fraud, including compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nThe more distant non-compliance with indirect laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n\n## Our Key Audit Matters\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the Key Audit Matters to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board . The Key Audit Matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters .\n\n## Assessment of Expected Credit Losses on loans and advances to customers and banks\n\n## Description\n\nAs discussed in the Credit Risk section of the annual report and in Note 3 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks amounts are EUR 598 billion and EUR 25 billion, respectively, as at 31 December 2020. Management considers the uncertainties of Covid-19 in the estimate of Expected Credit Losses ('ECL'), specifically regarding macroeconomic forecasts and behaviour of borrowers subject to payment holidays and government stimulus plans. These loans and advances are measured at amortised cost, less ECL of EUR 5.8 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  The judgements used to develop the Probability of Defaults ('PD'), the Loss Given Default ('LGD') and the Exposure At Default ('EAD'), including model or manually determined expected future recovery cash flows.\n- -  Use of forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts in the ECL, including GDP, unemployment, and house pricing index.\n- -  Criteria for identifying significant increase in credit risk ('SICR').\n- -  Calculation of management overlays to the ECL due to the increased uncertainty in the forecast of future economic conditions and to calculate the default ratio of borrowers with payment holidays.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this Key Audit Matter:\n\n- -  We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the ECLprocess for loans and advances to customers and banks. This included controls related to the assumptions (including macroeconomic forecasts, PD, LGD and EAD), review of model outputs, governance and monitoring of the ECL, determination of credit risk ratings, the estimated future recovery cash flows of individual loan provisions and management overlays recorded to ECL.\n- -  We involved credit risk professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the assumptions to determine the PD, LGD, and EAD parameters in models used by the Company to determine the collective provisions, and assessed management overlays recorded to the ECL, including payment holiday and time lag overlays. This included reperforming back-testing of certain models to evaluate current model performance. We considered the impact these overlays have on model calculations and results when reaching our conclusions.\n- -  We involved economic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in assessing the Company's methodology to determine the macroeconomic forecasts used in the ECL. We tested the reasonableness of management's forecasts against other external benchmarks and our own internal forecasts.\n- -  We involved corporate finance professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in examining the methodologies, cash flows and collateral values used in expected future recovery cash flow assessments of individual loan provisions for impaired loans. We challenged management's use of recovery scenarios and expected cash flows considering industry trends and comparable benchmarks, and recalculated recovery amounts.\n- -  We evaluated the identification of significant increase in credit risk in loans by challenging the scope of management's criteria used in staging assessments, the thresholds applied within each criterion, and the ability of staging criteria to identify SICR prior to loans being credit impaired.\n\n## Our observation\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we found management's overall assessment relating to the valuation of loans and advances to customers and banks within an acceptable range and adequately disclosed in Note 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements respectively.\n\nWe identified the assessment of ECL on loans and advances to customers and banks as a Key Audit Matter. Significant and complex auditor judgement and specialised skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the following elements of the overall estimate:",

Management conducts an impairment test annually in accordance with IAS 36, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a Cash Generating Unit ('CGU') may exceed its recoverable amount. As a result of the negative developments in the macroeconomic outlook in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the recoverable amount of goodwill has declined. The recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use ('VIU') of each CGU, based on management's dividend discount model.\n\nWe identified the assessment of goodwill impairment as a Key Audit Matter. There was a high degree of estimation uncertainty due to the sensitivity of assumptions used in the VIU-calculations and in identifying events or changes in circumstances that could be an indicator of impairment requiring complex auditor judgement.\n\nSpecifically, forecasts, terminal growth rates, discount rates and capital ratios were challenging to test as minor changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the Company's assessment of the recoverable amount. We performed sensitivity analyses to determine the significant assumptions used, which required challenging auditor judgement. Additionally, the audit effort associated with this estimate required specialised skills and knowledge.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this Key Audit Matter:\n\n- -  We identified events or changes in circumstances and tested management's process for determining the recoverable amount of each CGU.\n- -  We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's forecasts and cash flows for the individual CGUs by challenging the forecasts and comparing the assumptions to historical performance.\n- -  We involved valuation professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n- \u00b7 evaluating the mathematical accuracy of the model by recalculation of the discount rates and terminal value calculations included in the model, and assessment of the consistency of applied formulas;\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of certain assumptions applied in the model including capital ratios (by comparing with analyst consensus data for comparable entities), terminal growth rates (by comparing per country the terminal growth rates applied to long term inflation) and discount rates (by independently deriving the risk fee rate for cost of equity per country based on observable market data).\n\n## Our observation\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we found management's overall assessment relating to the valuation of goodwill within an acceptable range and adequately disclosed in Note 10.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk of inappropriate access or changes to information technology systems\n\n## Description\n\nING Group is dependent on its IT environment for the reliability and continuity of its operations and financial reporting. Inappropriate access or changes to an application or supporting infrastructure could impact an automated control and therefore compromise the reliability of financial data and continuity of ING Group's operations.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur audit approach depends to a large extent on the effectiveness of automated controls and, therefore. procedures are designed to test, among others, access and change management controls over IT systems. Given the IT technical characteristics of this part of the audit, IT audit specialists are an integral part of our engagement team.\n\nIT audit specialists assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT environment when relevant for the scope of our audit of the financial statements. We examined the framework of governance over ING Group's IT organisations, the IT general controls, and application controls.\n\nOur areas of focus related to the change management, user access management, cyber security, security event monitoring, automated and application controls of the IT systems relevant for financial reporting. Management has put efforts to remediate identified control deficiencies. For those control deficiencies that were not remediated, we tested compensating controls that addressed the same risk or mitigating controls that lowered the risk of the deficiency. For certain deficiencies during the period of remediation, we substantively assessed the access to determine whether inappropriate access occurred and whether changes made were appropriate.\n\n## Our observation\n\nThe combination of the tests of the controls and the substantive tests performed, provided sufficient evidence to enable us to rely on the adequate and continued operation of the IT systems for the purposes of our audit.\n\n## Report on the other information included in the annual report\n\nIn addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, the annual report contains other information.\n\nBased on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:\n\n- -  is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; and\n- -  contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nWe have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.\n\nBy performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.\n\nThe Executive Board of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.",

These services were rendered for the benefit of external users, largely driven by regulatory compliance.\n\n## Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements\n\n## Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS-EU and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the Executive Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Executive Board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Executive Board either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Executive Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, in the financial statements.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.\n\nOur audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Our audit included among others:\n\n- -  identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -  obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control;\n- -  evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Executive Board;\n- -  concluding on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- -  evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures; and\n- -  evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe are solely responsible for the opinion and therefore responsible to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the financial statements. In this respect, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this\n\nrespect, we also submit an additional report to the Audit Committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audits of public-interest entities. The\n\ninformation included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the Key Audit Matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.\n\n<!-- image -->",

ING may face a number of the risks described below simultaneously and some risks described below may be interdependent. While the risk factors below have been divided into categories, some risk factors could belong in more than one category and investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section. Additional risks of which the Company is not presently aware, or that are currently viewed as immaterial, could also affect the business operations of ING and have a material adverse effect on ING's business ac tivities, financial condition, results and prospects. The market price of ING shares or other securities could decline due to any of those risks including the risks described below, and investors could lose all or part of their investments.\n\nAlthough the most material risk factors have been presented first within each category, the order in which the remaining risk factors are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Retail Banking, our products include savings, payments, investments, loans and mortgages in most of our Retail Banking markets. In Wholesale Banking, we provide specialised lending, tailored corporate finance, debt and equity market solutions, payments & cash management, trade and treasury services. As a result, negative developments in financial markets and/or countries or regions in which we operate, have in the past had and may in the future have a material adverse impact on our business, results and financial condition, including as a result of the potential consequences listed below.\n\nFactors such as interest rates, securities prices, credit spreads, liquidity spreads, exchange rates, consumer spending, changes in customer behaviour, business investment, real estate values and private equity valuations, government spending, inflation or deflation, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, political events and trends, terrorism, pandemics and epidemics (such as Covid-19, as described in greater detail below under the heading 'ING's business, results and financial condition have been, and likely will continue to be adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic') or other widespread health emergencies all impact the business and economic environment and, ultimately, our solvency, liquidity and the amount and profitability of business we conduct in a specific geographic region. Certain of these risks are often experienced globally as well as in specific geographic regions\n\nand are described in greater detail below under the headings 'Interest rate volatility and other interest rate changes may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition', 'Inflation and deflation may negatively affect our business, r esults and financial condition', 'Market conditions, including those observed over the past few years and the application of IFRS 9 may increase the risk of loans being impaired and have a negative effect on our results and financial condition' and 'Continued risk of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in Europe and the United States, as well as ongoing volatility in the financial markets and the economy generally have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, result s and financial condition'. All of these are factors in local and regional economies as well as in the global economy, and we may be affected by changes in any one of these factors in any one country or region, and more if more of these factors occur simultaneously and/or in multiple countries or regions or on a global scale.\n\nIn case one or more of the factors mentioned above adversely affects the profitability of our business, this might also result, among other things, in the following:\n\n- \u25aa reserve and provisions inadequacies, which could ultimately be realised through profit and loss and shareholders' equity;\n- \u25aa the write-down of tax assets impacting net results and/or equity;\n- \u25aa impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, impacting net result; and/or\n- \u25aa movements in risk weighted assets for the determination of required capital.\n\nIn particular, we are exposed to financial, economic, market and political conditions in the Benelux countries and Germany, from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues in both Retail Banking and Wholesale Banking, and which present risks of economic downturn. Though less material, we also derive substantial revenues in the following geographic regions: Turkey, Eastern Europe (primarily Poland among others), Southern Europe (primarily Spain among others), East Asia (primarily Singapore among others) and Australia which also present risks of economic downturn. In an economic downturn, we expect that higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, higher corporate and private debt defaults, lower business investments and lower consumer spending would adversely affect the demand for banking products, and that ING may need to increase its reserves and provisions, each of which may result in overall lower earnings. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, as an example of an economic downturn, as well as the substantial monetary and government measures, are still materialising and expected to continue to affect our business.

Securities prices, real estate values and private equity valuations may also be adversely impacted, and any such losses would be realised through profit and loss and shareholders' equity. We also offer a number of financial products that expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, securities prices, corporate and private default rates, the value of real estate assets, exchange rates and credit spreads.\n\nFor further information on ING's exposure to particular geographic areas, see Note 35 'Information on geographic areas' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nING's business, results and financial condition have been, and likely will continue to be, adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and the related response measures introduced by various national and local governmental authorities aimed at preventing the further spread of the disease (such as bans on public events with over a certain number of attendees, closures of places where larger groups of people gather such as schools, sports facilities, bars and restaurants, lockdowns, border controls and travel and other restrictions) have disrupted the normal flow of business operations in those countries and regions where we and our customers and counterparties operate (such as, among others, Benelux, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S.). This disruption has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, global economic growth, supply chains, manufacturing, tourism, consumer spending, asset prices and unemployment levels, and has resulted in volatility and uncertainty across the global economy and financial markets.\n\nIn addition to the measures aimed at preventing the further spread of Covid-19, governments and central banks around the world have also introduced measures aimed at mitigating the economic consequences of the pandemic and related response measures, such as guarantee schemes, compensation schemes and cutting interest rates. For example, the Dutch government has implemented economic measures aimed at protecting jobs, households' wages and companies, e.g., by way of tax payment holidays, guarantee schemes and a compensation scheme for heavily affected sectors in the economy. These announced measures and any additional measures, including any\n\npayment holidays with respect to mortgages or other loans, have had and may continue to have a significant impact on our customers and other counterparties.\n\nGovernments, regulators and central banks (including the ECB), have also announced that they are taking or considering measures seeking to safeguard the stability of the financial sector, to prevent lending to the business sector from being jeopardised and to ensure the payment system continues to function properly. The ECB currently allows banks to operate below the level of capital required by the Pillar 2 Guidance, capital conservation buffer and the liquidity coverage ratio, and banks are also permitted to use a portion of their capital instruments that do not qualify as CET1 capital to meet the Pillar 2 Requirements. Several countries also released or reduced countercyclical buffers (CCyB). The ECB has also issued a recommendation to the banks that it supervises that such banks should exercise extreme prudence when deciding on or paying out dividends or performing share buy-backs until September 30, 2021. However, it is not certain whether these or future measures will be extended or maintained for a sufficient period of time, or whether such measures will be successful in mitigating the economic consequences of the pandemic and related response measures. If the pandemic is prolonged or the actions are unsuccessful, additional actions by governments and central banks may follow and the adverse impact on the global economy will deepen, and our business, results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic affected all of our businesses, including lower or negative interest rates, lower oil prices and credit deterioration of loans to ING's customers. These effects have also resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses and impairments on non-financial assets, and reduced net interest income due to lower interest rates. While these effects were partly offset by resilient fee and commission income in 2020, this level of activity may not persist in future periods. With Covid-19 infection rates having recently increased, especially in some European countries, and further lockdowns measures having been reintroduced, this may result in changes in government responses and further downside risk towards macro-economic developments, with possibly a deeper risk aversion and a delayed recovery. These developments may result in further negative impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nIn 2020, ING also took certain measures to support customers impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including payment holidays, offering credit facilities to business customers under government guarantee schemes and providing liquidity under credit facilities to large corporate customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\nAlthough, following supervisory guidelines, payment holidays do not automatically trigger an immediate classification of the loans as in default or as forborne, the credit quality of these loans will be monitored for future transitions into Stage 2 and could result in increased risk costs and additional risk weighted assets in future periods. As of December 31, 2020, in line with the European Banking Association (EBA) moratoria guidelines, ING has a total amount of \u20ac19.4 billion of payment holidays or 2.6% of total credit outstandings, granted to approximately 196,000 customers. While these customers are located across nearly all countries in which ING operates, over 55% of these customers are in the Netherlands and Belgium. ING also recorded \u20ac2,675 million of net additions to loan loss provisions in 2020 compared with \u20ac1,120 million in 2019. The 2020 risk costs were severely impacted by a combination of increased collective provisioning reflecting the worsened macro-economic indicators due to the Covid-19 pandemic, higher Individual Stage 3 provisions, and negative rating migration. Should these global economic conditions be prolonged or worsen, or should the pandemic lead to additional market disruptions, we may experience more customer defaults and further additions to loan loss provisions. In these circumstances, we may also experience reduced customer activity and demand for its products and services, increased utilization of lending commitments and higher credit and valuation adjustments on financial assets. In addition, persistently low interest rates for a longer period, as well as a potential further decline in interest rates might result in further decreases in net interest income. These factors and other consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nOur capital and liquidity position may also be adversely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and related response measures, including as a result of changes in future levels of savings and deposits from customers, changes in asset quality, and the effects of government or regulatory responses to the pandemic, and may require changes to our funding structure, impact our ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements and adversely affect our cost of capital and credit rating. Any of the foregoing developments may have a material adverse impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, most of our staff continue to work from home. Since May 2020, staff in various countries have started rotation schemes to return to work in the office in a controlled manner, taking into account local circumstances and any applicable government measures (including with respect to social distancing). This controlled office opening process is expected to allow for essential face-to-face meetings. However, with Covid-19 infection rates having recently increased, we expect\n\nthat more staff will again work from home. Due to the uncertainties relating to the future development of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is not certain when our employees may be generally expected or permitted to return to the offices. If due to illness, technical limitations or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, employees are unable to work or are not able to operate as effectively and efficiently as in the office, this may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, a situation in which most or some of our employees continue working from home may raise operational risks, including with respect to information security, data protection, availability of key systems and infrastructure integrity. There is also a risk that we will not be effective in implementing regulatory or strategic change programs in the current environment. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to new banking behaviour from customers. There has been an increase in the digital behaviour of our customers leading to reduced traffic in branches. Over 80% of our customers now interact with us via digital channels only. Criminals are also taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to carry out financial fraud and exploitation scams, with examples including advertising and trafficking in counterfeit medicines, offering fraudulent investment opportunities, fundraising for fake charities and engaging in phishing schemes that prey on virus-related fears. National authorities and international bodies (including the Financial Action Task Force) warn citizens and businesses on impostor, investment and product scams. Although we have organized a Covid-19 taskforce to identify and analyse new behavioural patterns, leading to new cases of unusual transactions being reported to the relevant authorities, new banking behaviours may result in additional Know Your Customer (KYC) risks. If any of these risks were to materialize that may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nThe duration of the pandemic and the impact of measures taken in response by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties, whether direct or indirect, such as by increasing sovereign debt of certain countries which may result in increased volatility and widening credit spreads, remain uncertain. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the extent to which our business, results and financial condition, as well as our ability to access capital and liquidity on financial terms acceptable for us, may be materially adversely affected.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A sustained increase in the inflation rate in our principal markets may also negatively affect our business, results and financial condition. For example, a sustained increase in the inflation rate may result in an increase in nominal market interest rates. A failure to accurately anticipate higher inflation and factor it into our product pricing assumptions may result in mispricing of our products, which could materially and adversely impact our results. On the other hand, recent concerns regarding negative interest rates and the low level of interest rates generally may negatively impact our net interest income, which may have an adverse impact on our profitability.\n\nA prolonged period of low interest rates, and in some situations negative interest rates, has resulted in, and may continue to result in:\n\n- \u25aa lower earnings over time on investments, as reinvestments will earn lower rates;\n- \u25aa increased prepayment or redemption of mortgages and fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolios, as well as increased prepayments of corporate loans. This as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates potentially combined with lower credit spreads. Consequently, we may be required to reinvest the proceeds into assets at lower interest rates;\n- \u25aa lower profitability as the result of a decrease in the spread between client rates earned on assets and client rates paid on savings, current account and other liabilities;\n- \u25aa higher costs for certain derivative instruments that may be used to hedge certain of our product risks;\n- \u25aa lower profitability since we may not be able to fully track the decline in interest rates in our savings rates;\n- \u25aa lower profitability since we may not always be entitled to impose surcharges to customers to compensate for the decline in interest rates;\n- \u25aa lower profitability since we may have to pay a higher premium for the defined contribution scheme in the Netherlands for which the premium paid is dependent on interest rate developments and the Dutch Central Bank's ('DNB's') methodology for determining the ultimate forward rate;\n\n- \u25aa lower interest rates may cause asset margins to decrease thereby lowering our results. This may for example be the consequence of increased competition for investments as result of the low rates, thereby driving margins down; and/or\n- \u25aa (depending on the position) a significant collateral posting requirement associated with our interest rate hedge programs, which could materially and adversely affect liquidity and our profitability.\n\nThe foregoing impacts have been and may be further amplified in a negative interest rate environment, since we may not be able to earn interest on our assets (including reserves). In addition, we have, and may continue to, earn negative interest on certain of our assets (including cash balances, loans and bonds), while still paying positive interest or no interest to others to hold our liabilities, resulting in an adverse impact on our credit spread and lowering of our net interest income. Furthermore, in the event that a negative interest rate environment results in ING's depositors being forced to pay interest to ING to hold cash deposits, some depositors may choose to withdraw their deposits rather than pay interest to ING, which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results and financial condition. For example, in March 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve has cut the benchmark U.S. interest rate in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and related impacts on the economy and financial markets. On 1 January 2021, ING announced that it will charge negative interest to customers on current and d eposit accounts exceeding \u20ac250,000 (such negative interest rate will only apply to the amount by which the current or deposit account exceeds \u20ac250,000 ). Such declines in interest rates in the United States or other markets in which ING and its customers and counterparties operate may have a significant adverse effect on our business and operations.\n\nAlternatively, any period of rapidly increasing interest rates may result in:\n\n- \u25aa a decrease in the demand for loans;\n- \u25aa higher interest rates to be paid on customer deposits and on debt securities that we have issued or may issue on the financial markets from time to time to finance our operations, which would increase our interest expenses and reduce our results;\n- \u25aa higher interest rates which can lead to lower investments prices and reduce the revaluation reserves, thereby lowering IFRS equity and the capital ratios. Also the lower securities value leads to a loss of liquidity generating capacity which needs to be compensated by attracting new liquidity generating capacity which reduces our results;",

While prudential regulation may reduce the probability of a default by a major financial institution, the actual occurrence of such a default could have a material adverse impact on ING. Such distress of, or default by, a major financial institution could disrupt markets or clearance and settlement systems and lead to a chain of defaults by other financial institutions, since the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely related as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships. Also the perceived lack of creditworthiness of a sovereign or a major financial institution (or a default by any such entity) may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. This risk is sometimes referred to as 'systemic risk' and may adversely affect finan cial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with whom we interact on a daily basis and financial instruments of sovereigns in which we invest. Systemic risk could impact ING directly, by exposing it to material credit losses on transactions with defaulting counterparties or indirectly by significantly reducing the available market liquidity on which ING and its lending customers depend to fund their operations and/or leading to a write down of loans or securities held by ING. In addition, ING may also be faced with additional open market risk for which hedging or mitigation strategies may not be available or effective (either by hedges eliminated by defaulting counterparties, or reduce market liquidity). Systemic risk could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise new funding and on our business, results and financial condition. In addition, such distress or failure could impact future product sales as a potential result of reduced confidence in the financial services industry.\n\nContinued risk of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in Europe and the United States, as well as ongoing volatility in the financial markets and the economy generally have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results and financial condition.\n\nOur global business and results are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. In Europe, there are continuing concerns over weaker economic conditions, levels of unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, credit spreads, and the impact of continued quantitative easing within the Eurozone through bond repurchases and the ECB's targeted longer -term refinancing operation ('TLTRO' ). In addition, geopolitical issues, including trade tensions between the US and China, increasing protectionism between key countries, and issues with respect to the Middle East, Russia/Ukraine and North Korea may all contribute to adverse developments in the global capital markets and the economy generally.\n\nAdverse developments in the market have included, for example, temporary decrease in liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased probability of default for fixed income securities. Moreover, there is a risk that an adverse credit event at one or more European sovereign debtors (including a credit rating downgrade or a default) could trigger a broader economic downturn in Europe and elsewhere. In addition, the confluence of these and other factors has resulted in volatile foreign exchange markets. International equity markets have also continued to experience heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers, including ourselves, that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage, private equity and credit markets particularly affected. These events, market upheavals and continuing risks, including high levels of volatility, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our results, in part because we have a large investment portfolio.\n\nThere is also continued uncertainty over the long-term outlook for the tax, spending and borrowing policies of the US, the future economic performance of the US within the global economy and any potential future budgetary restrictions in the US, with a potential impact on a future sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the US government, including the rating of US Treasury securities. A downgrade of US Treasury securities could also impact the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the US government. US Treasury securities and other US government-linked securities are key assets on the balance sheets of many financial institutions and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions\n\n<!-- image -->",

The impact of any further downgrades to the sovereign credit rating of the US government or a default by the US government on its debt obligations would create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which would weigh heavily on the global financial system and could consequently result in a significant adverse impact to the Group's business and operations.\n\nIn many cases, the markets for investments and instruments have been and remain illiquid, and issues relating to counterparty credit ratings and other factors have exacerbated pricing and valuation uncertainties. Valuation of such investments and instruments is a complex process involving the consideration of market transactions, pricing models, management judgment and other factors, and is also impacted by external factors, such as underlying mortgage default rates, interest rates, rating agency actions and property valuations. Historically these factors have resulted in, among other things, valuation and impairment issues in connection with our exposures to European sovereign debt and other investments.\n\nAny of these general developments in global financial and political conditions could negatively impact to our business, results and financial condition in future periods.\n\nDiscontinuation of or changes to 'benchmark' indices may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nFinancial markets  have historically relied on Interbank Offered Rates ('IBORs') benchmarks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), the Euro OverNight Index Average ('EONIA') and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate ('EURIBOR'). These interest rate 'benchmarks' have been the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform. For example, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), as the administrator of LIBOR, issued a consultation with respect to its plans for the cessation for most LIBOR rates at the end of 2021, with an 18 month extension proposed for USD LIBOR, one of the most widely used LIBOR rates. EONIA will cease to be published by 1 January 2022 and the European Money Markets Institute (EONIA's administrator) has indicated that EONI A cannot be used in any contracts that may be outstanding as of 1 January 2022. Following the implementation of such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform or be calculated differently than in the past, or such benchmarks may cease to exist entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted.\n\nPublic authorities have initiated industry working groups in various jurisdictions to develop and recommend alternative rates that could serve as replacements when such rates cease to exist or materially change. This is commonly referred to as a fallback rate. The US Federal Reserve's Alternative Reference Rates Committee (commonly referred to as 'ARRC') has recommended adoption of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (commonly referred to as 'SOFR') as an alternative to USD LIBOR, and the limited extension announced by the IBA has eased the timeline for the transition of existing contracts referencing USD LIBOR. For EURIBOR, the Working Group on Euro Risk-Free Rates is continuing its work on developing recommended fallback rates based on the 'euro short -term rate' (\u20acSTR). \u20acSTR is being published and is now widely used, and calculation of the EONIA benchmark described above has been modif ied to refer to the \u20acSTR benchmark until the EONIA benchmark is discontinued .\n\nPublic authorities have also recognised that certain LIBOR contracts do not contain any alternatives, contain inappropriate alternatives, or cannot be renegotiated or amended prior to the expected cessation of LIBOR. In response to this challenge the FCA, as the supervisor of LIBOR, plans to make use of the proposed powers granted to them to enable continued publication of a 'synthetic' LIBOR using a different methodology and inputs, which may help reduce disruption to holders of tough legacy contracts. However, there is no certainty as to whether the FCA will exercise these powers or what form the revised methodology would take, and the FCA has consequently encouraged users of LIBOR to renegotiate or amend as many contracts as possible before the relevant LIBOR ceases.  In response, the European Commission has announced various legislative fixes, that most notably reduce the scope for potential conflict with the solutions proposed by other jurisdictions. However, there is no guarantee that regulators will implement measures to address such legacy contracts, or that such measures will be effective in avoiding business disruption or contractual disputes.\n\nThe potential discontinuation of interest rate benchmarks or any other benchmark, or changes in the methodology or manner of administration of any benchmark, could result in a number of risks for the Group, its customers, and the financial services industry more widely. These risks include legal risks in relation to changes required to documentation for new and existing transactions. The Group may also be exposed to operational risks or incur additional costs due to the potential requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure processes, or in relation to communications with clients or other parties and engagement during the transition period. In addition to the heightened conduct and operational risks, the process of adopting new reference rates may expose the Group to an increased\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is not currently possible to determine the full impact of such changes on the Group, and the implementation of alternative benchmark rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nInflation and deflation may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nA sustained increase in the inflation rate in our principal markets would have multiple impacts on us and may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition. For example, a sustained increase in the inflation rate may result in an increase in market interest rates, which may:\n\n- \u25aa decrease the estimated fair value of certain fixed income securities that we hold in our investment portfolios, resulting in:\n- \u25aa reduced levels of unrealised capital gains available to us, which could negatively impact our solvency position and net income, and/or\n- \u25aa a decrease in collateral values,\n- \u25aa result in increased withdrawal of certain savings products, particularly those with fixed rates below market rates,\n- \u25aa require us, as an issuer of securities, to pay higher interest rates on debt securities that we issue in the financial markets from time to time to finance our operations, which would increase our interest expenses and reduce our results.\n\nA significant and sustained increase in inflation has historically also been associated with decreased prices for equity securities and sluggish performance of equity markets generally. A sustained decline in equity markets may:\n\n- \u25aa result in impairment charges to equity securities that we hold in our investment portfolios and reduced levels of unrealised capital gains available to us which would reduce our net income, and\n- \u25aa lower the value of our equity investments impacting our capital position.\n\nIn addition, a failure to accurately anticipate higher inflation and factor it into our product pricing may result in a systemic mispricing of our products, which would negatively impact our results.\n\nOn the other hand, deflation experienced in our principal markets may also adversely affect our financial performance. In recent years, the risk of low inflation and even deflation (i.e., a continued period with negative rates of inflation) in the Eurozone has materialized. Deflation may erode collateral values and diminish the quality of loans and cause a decrease in borrowing levels, which would negatively affect our business and results.\n\nMarket conditions, including those observed over the past few years, and the application of IFRS 9 may increase the risk of loans being impaired and have a negative effect on our results and financial condition.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk that our borrowers (including sovereigns) may not repay their loans according to their contractual terms and that the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient. We may see adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties, for example, as a result of their inability to refinance their indebtedness, with increasing delinquencies, defaults and insolvencies across a range of sectors. This may lead to impairment charges on loans and other assets, higher costs and additions to loan loss provisions. A significant increase in the size of our provision for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition. Also see above under the heading '-ING's busi ness, results and financial condition have been, and likely will continue to be adversely affected by the Covid19 pandemic'. As set out there, we expect to be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic through its impact on, among others, the financial condition of our customers or other counterparties.\n\nIFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' became effective as per 1 January 2018 and results in loan loss provisions that may be recognized earlier, on a more forward looking basis and on a broader scope of financial instruments than was previously the case under IAS 39. ING has applied the classification, measurement, and impairment requirements retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet and opening equity as at 1 January 2018. As a result of applying IFRS 9, a shift in the forward looking consensus view of economic conditions may materially impact the models used to calculate loan loss provisions under IFRS 9 and cause more volatility in, or higher levels of, loan loss provisions, any of which could adversely affe ct the Group's results, financial condition or regulatory capital position.\n\nEconomic and other factors could lead to contraction in the residential mortgage and commercial lending market and to decreases in residential and commercial property prices, which could generate\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, continuing low oil prices could have an influence on the repayment capacity of certain corporate borrowers active in the oil and oil related services industries.\n\nWe may incur losses due to failures of banks falling under the scope of state compensation schemes.\n\nWhile prudential regulation is intended to minimize the risk of bank failures, in the event such a failure occurs, given our size, we may incur significant compensation payments to be made under the Dutch Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS), which we may be unable to recover from the bankrupt estate, and therefore the consequences of any future failure of such a bank could be significant to ING. Such costs and the associated costs to be borne by us may have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition.  On the basis of the EU Directive on deposit guarantee schemes, ING pays quarterly risk-weighted contributions into a DGS-fund.  The DGS-fund is to grow to a target size of 0.8% of all deposits guaranteed under the DGS, which is expected to be reached in July 2024. In case of failure of a Dutch bank, depositor compensation is paid from the DGS-fund. If the available financial means of the fund are insufficient, Dutch banks, including ING, may be required pay to extraordinary ex-post contributions not exceeding 0.5% of their covered deposits per calendar year.  In exceptional circumstances and with the consent of the competent authority, higher contributions may be required. However, extraordinary ex-post contributions may be temporarily deferred if, and for so long as, they would jeopardise the solvency or liquidity of a bank. Depending on the size of the failed bank, the available financial means in the fund, and the required additional financial means, the impact of the extraordinary ex-post contributions on ING may be material.\n\nSince 2015, the EU has been discussing the introduction of a pan-European deposit guarantee scheme ('EDIS'), (partly) replacing or complem enting national compensation schemes in two or three phases. Proposals contain elements of (re)insurance, mutual lending and mutualisation of funds. The new model is intended to be 'overall cost -neutral'. Discussions have continued in 2020, but it remains uncertain when EDIS will be introduced and, if introduced, what impact EDIS would have on ING's business and operations.\n\n## Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group\n\nNon-compliance with laws and/or regulations concerning financial services or financial institutions, including with respect to financial economic crimes, could result in fines and other liabilities, penalties or consequences for us, which could materially affect our business and reduce our profitability.\n\nING has faced, and in the future may continue to face, the risk of consequences in connection with non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For additional information on legal proceedings, see Note 45 'Legal proceedings' to the consolidated financi al statements. There are a number of risks in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear, subject to multiple interpretations or under development, or where regulations may conflict with one another, or where regulators revise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rulings, which could result in our failure to meet applicable standards. Regulators and other authorities have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which could result, among other things, in suspension or revocation of our licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action, which could materially harm our results and financial condition. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, any of these matters appropriately, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to additional legal risk, which could, in turn, increase the size and number of claims and damages brought against us or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\n\nFurthermore, as a financial institution, we are exposed to the risk of unintentional involvement in criminal activity in connection with the commission of financial economic crimes, including with respect to money laundering and the funding of terrorist and other criminal activities. The failure or perceived failure by us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements with respect to financial economic crimes may result in adverse publicity, claims and allegations, litigation and regulatory investigations and sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results, financial condition and/or prospects in any given period. For further discussion of the impact of litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions with respect to financial economic crimes, see 'We may be subject to litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions, and adverse publicity' below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regulation of the industries in which we operate is becoming increasingly more extensive and complex, while also attracting supervisory scrutiny. Compliance with applicable and new laws and regulations is resources-intensive, and may materially increase our operating costs. Moreover, these regulations intended to protect our customers, markets and society as a whole can limit our activities, among others, through stricter net capital,  market conduct and transparency requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which we can operate or invest.\n\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our industry have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions.\n\nWe are subject to additional legal and regulatory risk in certain countries where we operate with less developed or predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn certain countries in which we operate, judiciary and dispute resolution systems may be less effective. As a result, in case of a breach of contract, we may have difficulties in making and enforcing claims against contractual counterparties and, if claims are made against us, we might encounter difficulties in mounting a defence against such allegations. If we become party to legal proceedings in a market with an insufficiently developed judicial system, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and net results.\n\nIn addition, as a result of our operations in certain countries, we are subject to risks of possible nationalisation, expropriation, price controls, exchange controls and other restrictive government actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities and or war, in these markets. Furthermore, the current economic environment in certain countries in which we operate may increase the likelihood for\n\nregulatory initiatives to enhance consumer protection or to protect homeowners from foreclosures. Any such regulatory initiative could have an adverse impact on our ability to protect our economic interest, for instance in the event of defaults on residential mortgages.\n\nWe are subject to the regulatory supervision of the ECB and other regulators with extensive supervisory and investigatory powers.\n\nIn its capacity as principal prudential supervisor in the EU, the ECB has extensive supervisory and investigatory powers, including the ability to issue requests for information, to conduct regulatory investigations and on-site inspections, and to impose monetary and other sanctions. For example, under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the regulators with jurisdiction over the Group, including the ECB, may conduct stress tests and have discretion to impose capital surcharges on financial institutions for risks that are not otherwise recognised in risk-weighted assets or other surcharges depending on the individual situation of the bank and take or require other measures, such as restrictions on or changes to the Group's business. Competent authorities may als o, if the Group fails to comply with regulatory requirements, in particular with supervisory actions, minimum capital requirements (including buffer requirements) or with liquidity requirements, or if there are shortcomings in its governance and risk management processes, prohibit the Group from making dividend payments to shareholders or distributions to holders of its regulatory capital instruments. Generally, a failure to comply with prudential or conduct regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results and financial condition .\n\nThe regulatory consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may have adverse effects on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nOn 24 December 2020, the United Kingdom and the EU agreed to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the 'TCA') in connection with the departure of the UK from the EU (commonly referred to as 'Brexit'). However, the financial services provisions of the TCA are very limited and , as a re sult, UKbased financial services providers lost EU passporting rights as of 1 January 2021 and EU-UK financial services are now subject to unilateral equivalence decisions. EU and UK regulators have, however, taken certain measures to address overall financial stability risks, such as the temporary extension by the EU of equivalence recognition to UK-based central counterparties (UK CCPs) through to 30 June 2022.

The absence of such equivalence decisions for financial services could have a neg ative impact on ING's activities, with  the absence of future UK CCPs recognition expected to increase costs for both ING and its financial markets customers. In addition, Brexit has required and will require other changes to ING's business and operations, including requiring ING to apply for a third country branch banking licenses in the UK for which ECB conditions and PRA & FCA authorisation decisions remain pending. ING is also progressing the move of certain financial markets activities from London to A msterdam in light of ECB's supervisory expectations on booking models as a result of Brexit. The regulatory impact of Brexit continues to present material risks and uncertainties, particularly as to how regulations may diverge between the EU and the UK, wh ich could materially increase ING's compliance costs and have a material adverse effect on ING's business, results and financial condition .\n\nFailure to meet minimum capital and other prudential regulatory requirements as applicable to us from time to time may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition and on our ability to make payments on certain of our securities.\n\nING is subject to a variety of regulations that require us to comply with minimum requirements for capital (own funds) and additional loss absorbing capacity, as well as for liquidity, and to comply with leverage restrictions. In addition, such capital, liquidity and leverage requirements and their application and interpretation may change. Any changes may require us to maintain more capital or to raise a different type of capital by disqualifying existing capital instruments from continued inclusion in regulatory capital, requiring replacement with new capital instruments that meet the new criteria. Sometimes changes are introduced subject to a transitional period during which the new requirements are being phased in, gradually progressing to a fully phased-in, or fully-loaded, application of the requirements.\n\nAny failure to comply with these requirements, or to adapt to changes in such requirements, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition, and may require us to seek additional capital. Failures to meet minimum capital or other prudential requirements may also result in ING being prohibited from making payments on certain of our securities. Because implementation phases and transposition into EU or national regulation where required may often\n\ninvolve a lengthy period, the impact of changes in capital, liquidity and leverage regulations on our business, results and financial condition, and on our ability to make payments on certain of our securities, is often unclear.\n\nFor further discussion of the impact of minimum capital and other prudential regulatory requirements on ING, see 'Item 4. Information on the CompanyRegulation and Supervision -Regulatory Developments -Basel III and European Union Standards as currently applied by ING Group .'\n\nOur US commodities and derivatives business is subject to CFTC and SEC regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nOur affiliate ING Capital Markets LLC is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') as a swap dealer and is subject to CFTC regulation of the off-exchange derivatives market pursuant to Title VII of the U.S. DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  ('Dodd -Frank').  Operating as a swap dealer requires compliance with CFTC regulatory requirements, which may be burdensome, impose additional compliance costs and could adversely affect the profitability of this business, as well as exposing ING to the risk of non-compliance with these regulations.\n\nING Capital Markets LLC is also expected to register with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer pursuant to Dodd-Frank and SEC regulations enacted thereunder effective 1 November 2021. SEC registration may increase ING Capital Markets LLC's operational costs as a result of compliance, margin, capital and other requiremen ts, and result in a substantial portion or all of ING's security -based swap activities with U.S. persons being conducted through ING Capital Markets LLC. These registration and related requirements may also reduce trading activity, reduce market liquidity and increase volatility in the relevant markets.\n\nIn addition, new position limits under Dodd-Frank applicable to the derivatives market generally for uncleared swaps referencing any of twentyfive commodity futures contracts could limit ING's position sizes in these swaps and similarly limit the ability of counterparties to utilize certain of our products to the extent hedging exemptions from the position limits are unavailable. Such regulation of the derivative markets and market participants will likely result in increased cost of hedging and other trading activities, both for ING and its customers, which could expose our business to greater risk and could reduce the size and profitability of our customer business.

Any of the foregoing factors, and any further regulatory developments with respect to commodities and derivatives, could have a material impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nFor further discussion of the impact of regulation of commodities and derivatives on ING, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company -Regulation and Supervision -Regulatory Developments -Dodd-Frank Act and other US Regulations .'\n\nWe are subject to several other bank recovery and resolution regimes that include statutory write down and conversion as well as other powers, which remains subject to significant uncertainties as to scope and impact on us.\n\nWe are subject to several recovery and resolution regimes, including the Single Resolution Mechanism ('SRM'), the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive' ('BRRD') as implemented in national leg islation, and the Dutch 'Intervention Act' (Wet bijzondere maatregelen financi\u00eble ondernemingen, as implemented in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act). The SRM applies to banks that are supervised by the ECB under the SSM, with the aim of ensuring an orderly resolution of failing banks at minimum costs for taxpayers and the real economy. The BRRD establishes a common framework for the recovery and resolution for banks within the European Union, with the aim of providing supervisory authorities and resolution authorities with common tools and powers to address banking crises preemptively in order to safeguard financial stability and minimise taxpayers' exposure to losses. In addition, the Intervention Act confers wide-ranging powers to the Dutch Minister of Finance, including, among other things, in relation to shares and other securities issued by us or with our cooperation or other claims on us (including, without limitation, expropriation thereof) if there is a serious and immediate threat to the stability of the financial system. Any application of statutory write-down and conversion or other powers would not be expected to constitute an event of default under our securities entitling holders to seek repayment. If any of these powers were to be exercised in respect of ING, there could be a material adverse effect on both ING and on holders of ING securities, including through a material adverse effect on credit ratings and/or the price of our securities. Investors in our securities may lose their investment if resolution measures are taken under current or future regimes.\n\nFor further discussion of the impact of bank recovery and resolution regimes on ING, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company -Regulation and Supervision -Regulatory Developments -Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.'\n\n## Risks related to litigation, enforcement proceedings and investigations and to changes in tax laws\n\nWe may be subject to litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions, and adverse publicity.\n\nWe are involved in governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations involving claims by and against us which arise in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in connection with our activities as financial services provider, employer, investor and taxpayer. As a financial institution, we are subject to specific laws and regulations governing financial services or financial institutions. See 'Changes in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our operating costs and limit our activities' above. Financial reporting irregularities involving other large and well -known companies, possible findings of government authorities in various jurisdictions which are investigating several rate-setting processes, notifications made by whistleblowers, increasing regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny of 'know your customer' anti -money laundering, tax evasion, prohibited transactions with countries or persons subject to sanctions, and bribery or other anti-corruption measures and anti-terrorist-financing procedures and their effectiveness, regulatory investigations of the banking industry, and litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure by us to comply with legal, regulatory, tax and compliance requirements could result in adverse publicity and reputational harm, lead to increased regulatory supervision, affect our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain access to the capital markets, result in cease and desist orders, claims, enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal penalties, other disciplinary action or have other material adverse effects on us in ways that are not predictable. Some claims and allegations may be brought by or on behalf of a class and claimants may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including compensatory, liquidated, treble and punitive damages. Our reserves for litigation liabilities may prove to be inadequate.

Adverse publicity, claims and allegations, litigation and regulatory investigations and sanctions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results, financial condition and/or prospects in any given period.\n\nWe are subject to different tax regulations in each of the jurisdictions where we conduct business, and are exposed to changes in tax laws, and risks of non-compliance with or proceedings or investigations with respect to, tax laws.\n\nChanges in tax laws (including case law) could increase our taxes and our effective tax rates and could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition. Changes in tax laws could also make certain ING products less attractive, which could have adverse consequences for our businesses and results. Because of the geographic spread of its business, ING may be subject to tax audits, investigations and procedures in numerous jurisdictions at any point in time. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all our tax positions, the ultimate resolution of these audits, investigations and procedures may result in liabilities which are different from the amounts recognized. In addition, increased bank taxes in countries where the Group is active result in increased taxes on ING's banking operations, which could negatively impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nWe may be subject to withholding tax if we fail to comply with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ('FATCA') and other US withholding tax regulations\n\nDue to the nature of its business, ING is subject to various provisions of US tax law. These include FATCA, which requires ING to provide certain i nformation for the US Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and the Qualified Intermediary ('QI') requirements, which require withholding tax on certain non US -source payments. Failure to comply with FATCA and/or QI requirements and regulations could also harm our reputation and could subject the Group to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues, results, financial condition and prospects. For additional information with respect to specific proceedings, see Note 45 'Legal proceedings' to the consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of FATCA and QI requirements with respect to ING, see 'Item 4. Information on the CompanyRegulation and Supervision -Regulatory Developments -Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.'\n\nING is exposed to the risk of claims from customers who feel misled or treated unfairly because of advice or information received.\n\nOur products and services, including banking products and advice services for third-party products are exposed to claims from customers who might allege that they have received misleading advice or other information from advisers (both internal and external) as to which products were most appropriate for them, or that the terms and conditions of the products, the nature of the products or the circumstances under which the products were sold, were misrepresented to them. When new financial products are brought to the market, ING engages in a multidisciplinary product approval process in connection with the development and distribution of such products, including production of appropriate marketing and communication materials. Notwithstanding these processes, customers may make claims against ING if the products do not meet their expectations. Customer protection regulations, as well as changes in interpretation and perception by both the public at large and governmental authorities of acceptable market practices, influence customer expectations.\n\nProducts distributed through person-to-person sales forces have a higher exposure to such claims as the sales forces may provide face-to-face financial planning and advisory services. Complaints may also arise if customers feel that they have not been treated reasonably or fairly, or that the duty of care has not been complied with.

Operational risks are inherent to our business. Our businesses depend on the ability to process and report a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. In addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we endeavour to safeguard our systems and processes, losses can result from inadequately trained or skilled personnel, IT failures (including due to a computer virus or a failure to anticipate or prevent cyber attacks or other attempts to gain unauthorised access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or impairing operational performance, or security breaches by third parties), inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems, regulatory breaches, human errors, employee misconduct, including fraud, or from natural disasters or other external events that interrupt normal business operations. Such losses may adversely affect our reputation, business and results. We depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and\n\nnetworks. The equipment and software used in our computer systems and networks may not always be capable of processing, storing or transmitting information as expected. Despite our business continuity plans and procedures, certain of our computer systems and networks may have insufficient recovery capabilities in the event of a malfunction or loss of data. As part of our Accelerated Think Forward strategy, we are consistently managing and monitoring our IT risk profile globally. ING is subject to increasing regulatory requirements including EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and EU Payment Servic es Directive ('PSD2'). Failure to appropriately manage and monitor our IT risk profile could affect our ability to comply with these regulatory requirements, to securely and efficiently serve our clients or to timely, completely or accurately process, store and transmit information, and may adversely impact our reputation, business and results. For further description of the particular risks associated with cybercrime, which is a specific risk to ING as a result of its strategic focus on technology and inno vation, see 'We are subject to increasing risks related to cybercrime and compliance with cybersecurity regulation' below.\n\nWidespread outbreaks of communicable diseases may impact the health of our employees, increasing absenteeism, or may cause a significant increase in the utilisation of health benefits offered to our employees, either or both of which could adversely impact our business. Also see above under the heading '-ING's business, results and financial condition have been, and likely will contin ue to be adversely affected by the Covid19 pandemic'. As set out there, we expect to be affected by the C ovid19 pandemic through its impact on, among others, our employees. We also face physical risks, including natural disasters as a direct result of climate change, such as extreme weather events or rising water levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, particularly where our headquarters may be impacted. For further description of the risks associated herewith, see 'We may be exposed to business, operational, regulatory, reputational and other risks in connection with climate change' below. In addition, other events including unforeseeable and/or catastrophic events can lead to an abrupt interruption of activities, and our operations may be subject to losses resulting from such disruptions. Losses can result from destruction or impairment of property, financial assets, trading positions, and the loss of key personnel. If our business continuity plans are not able to be implemented, are not effective or do not sufficiently take such events into account, losses may increase further.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\n## We are subject to increasing risks related to cybercrime and compliance with cybersecurity regulation.\n\nLike other financial institutions and global companies, we are regularly the target of cyber attacks, which is a specific risk to ING as a result of its strategic focus on technology and innovation. In particular, threats from Distributed Denial of Service ('DDoS'), targeted attacks (also called Adv anced Persistent Threats) and Ransomware intensify worldwide, and attempts to gain unauthorised access and the techniques used for such attacks are increasingly sophisticated. We have faced, and expect to continue to face, an increasing number of cyber attacks (both successful and unsuccessful) as we have further digitalized. This includes the continuing expansion of our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage and reliance on cloud technology. In particular, ING is regularly subject to DDoS attacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated. For example, in 2020 ING experienced DDoS attacks in Turkey and Belgium. However, to date ING has not experienced a material loss of money or data due to cybercrime.\n\nCybersecurity, customer data and data privacy have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The EU's second Payment Services Directive ('PSD2') and GDPR are examples of such regulations. In certain locations where ING is active, there are additional local regulatory requirements and legislation on top of EU regulations that must be followed for business conducted in that jurisdiction. Some of these legislations and regulations may be conflicting due to local regulatory interpretations. We may become subject to new EU and local legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity, security of customer data in general or the privacy of information we may store or maintain. Compliance with such new legislation or regulation could increase the Group' s compliance cost. Failure to comply with new and existing legislation or regulation could harm our reputation and could subject the Group to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\n\nING may be exposed to the risks of misappropriation, unauthorised access, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other external attacks or internal breaches that could have a security impact. These events could also jeopardise our confidential information or that of our clients or our counterparties and this could be exacerbated by the increase in data protection requirements as a result of GDPR. These events can potentially result in financial loss and harm to our reputation, hinder our operational effectiveness, result in regulatory censure, compensation costs or fines resulting from regulatory investigations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation,\n\nrevenues, results, financial condition and prospects. Even when we are successful in defending against cyber attacks, such defence may consume significant resources or impose significant additional costs on ING.\n\nBecause we operate in highly competitive markets, including our home market, we may not be able to increase or maintain our market share, which may have an adverse effect on our results.\n\nThere is substantial competition in the Netherlands and the other countries in which we do business for the types of wholesale banking, retail banking, investment banking and other products and services we provide. Customer loyalty and retention can be influenced by a number of factors, including brand recognition, reputation, relative service levels, the prices and attributes of products and services, scope of distribution, credit ratings and actions taken by existing or new competitors (including non-bank or financial technology competitors). A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely impact our ability to maintain or further increase our market share, which would adversely affect our results. Such competition is most pronounced in our more mature markets of the Netherlands, Belgium, the rest of Western Europe and Australia. In recent years, however, competition in emerging markets, such as Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, has also increased as large financial services companies from more developed countries have sought to establish themselves in markets which are perceived to offer higher growth potential, and as local institutions have become more sophisticated and competitive and proceeded to form alliances, mergers or strategic relationships with our competitors. The Netherlands is our largest market. Our main competitors in the banking sector in the Netherlands are ABN AMRO Bank and Rabobank.\n\nCompetition could also increase due to new entrants (including non-bank and financial technology competitors) in the markets that may have new operating models that are not burdened by potentially costly legacy operations and that are subject to reduced regulation. New entrants may rely on new technologies, advanced data and analytic tools, lower cost to serve, reduced regulatory burden and/or faster processes in order to challenge traditional banks. Developments in technology has also accelerated the use of new business models, and ING may not be successful in adapting to this pace of change or may incur significant costs in adapting its business and operations to meet such changes. For example, new business models have been observed in retail payments, consumer and commercial lending (such as peer-to-peer lending), foreign exchange and low-cost investment advisory services.

Future economic turmoil may accelerate additional consolidation activity. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy. These developments could result in our competitors gaining greater access to capital and liquidity, expanding their ranges of products and services, or gaining geographic diversity. We may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors in the event that some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices.\n\nWe may not always be able to protect our intellectual property developed in our products and services and may be subject to infringement claims, which could adversely impact our core business, inhibit efforts to monetize our internal innovations and restrict our ability to capitalize on future opportunities.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, trade name, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property, which we develop in connection with our products and services. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. In that event, we may be required to incur significant costs, and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could have an adverse effect on our core business and our ability to compete, including through the monetization of our internal innovations.\n\nWe may also be subject to claims made by third parties for (1) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (2) breach of copyright, trademark or licence usage rights, or (3) misappropriation of\n\ntrade secrets. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licences. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or to implement a costly workaround. Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business and results and could restrict our ability to pursue future business opportunities.\n\nThe inability of counterparties to meet their financial obligations or our inability to fully enforce our rights against counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our results.\n\nThird parties that have an payment obligations to ING, or obligations to return money, securities or other assets, may not pay or perform under their obligations. These parties include the issuers and guarantors (including sovereigns) of securities we hold, borrowers under loans originated, reinsurers, customers, trading counterparties, securities lending and repurchase counterparties, counterparties under swaps, credit default and other derivative contracts, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. Defaults by one or more of these parties on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, continuing low oil or other commodity prices, operational failure or other factors, or even rumours about potential defaults by one or more of these parties or regarding a severe distress of the financial services industry generally, could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition and liquidity. Given the high level of interdependence between financial institutions, we are and will continue to be subject to the risk of deterioration of the commercial and financial soundness, or perceived soundness, of sovereigns and other financial services institutions. This is particularly relevant to our franchise as an important and large counterparty in equity, fixed income and foreign exchange markets, including related derivatives.\n\nWe routinely execute a high volume of transactions, such as unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and equity investments with counterparties and customers in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, insurance companies, institutional clients, futures clearing merchants, swap dealers, and other\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, we could face concentration risk with respect to liabilities or amounts we expect to collect from specific counterparties and customers. We are exposed to increased counterparty risk as a result of recent financial institution failures and weakness and will continue to be exposed to the risk of loss if counterparty financial institutions fail or are otherwise unable to meet their obligations. A default by, or even concerns about the creditworthiness of, one or more of these counterparties or customers or other financial services institutions could therefore have an adverse effect on our results or liquidity.\n\nWith respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to a number of financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and equity investments. For example, we hold certain hybrid regulatory capital instruments issued by financial institutions which permit the issuer to cancel coupon payments on the occurrence of certain events or at their option. The EC has indicated that, in certain circumstances, it may require these financial institutions to cancel payment. If this were to happen, we expect that such instruments may experience ratings downgrades and/or a drop in value and we may have to treat them as impaired, which could result in significant losses. There is no assurance that losses on, or impairments to the carrying value of, these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business, results or financial condition.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. The deterioration or perceived deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and/ or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our income and risk weighting, leading to increased capital requirements. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. Also in this case, our credit risk may also be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us, which is most likely to occur during periods of illiquidity and depressed asset valuations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis of 2008. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may\n\nsubject us to claims. Bankruptcies, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral tend to increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Any of these developments or losses could materially and adversely affect our business, results, financial condition, and/or prospects.\n\nRatings are important to our business for a number of reasons, and a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our results and net results.\n\nCredit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. Our credit ratings are important to our ability to raise capital and funding through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. In the event of a downgrade, the cost of issuing debt will increase, having an adverse effect on our net results. Certain institutional investors may also be obliged to withdraw their deposits from ING following a downgrade, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. They can also have lower risk appetite for our debt notes, leading to lower purchases of (newly issued) debt notes. We have credit ratings from S&P, Moody's Investor Service and Fitch Ratings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings and rating methodologies on a recurring basis and may decide on a downgrade at any time.\n\nAs rating agencies continue to evaluate the financial services industry, it is possible that rating agencies will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to financial institutions, increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, request additional information from the companies that they rate and potentially adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. It is possible that the outcome of any such review of us would have additional adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. We may need to take actions in response to changing standards or capital requirements set by any of the rating agencies, which could cause our business and operations to suffer. We cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies.\n\nFurthermore, ING Bank's assets are risk -weighted. Downgrades of these assets could result in a higher risk-weighting, which may result in higher capital requirements. This may impact net earnings and the return on capital, and may have an adverse impact on our competitive position.",

The perception of climate change as a risk by civil society, shareholders, governments and other stakeholders continues to increase, including in relation to the financial sector's operations and strategy, and international actions regulating or restricting CO2 emissions, such as the Paris agreement, may also result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure from such stakeholders regarding the management and disclosure of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. For further information regarding the alignment of ING's lending portfolio with its climate-relate d goals, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company -Business Overview -Responsible finance' below.\n\nFor a description of the physical risks to our business resulting from natural disasters as a result of climate change, see 'Operational risks, such as systems disruptions or failures, breaches of security, cyber attacks, human error, changes in operational practices, inadequate controls including in respect of third parties with which we do business, natural disasters or outbreaks of communicable diseases may adversely impact our reputation, business and results' above .\n\nAn inability to retain or attract key personnel may affect our business and results.\n\nING Group relies to a considerable extent on the quality of its senior management, such as members of the executive committee, and management in the jurisdictions which are material to ING's business and operations. The success of ING Group's operations is dependent, among other things, on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for key personnel in most countries in which ING Group operates, and globally for senior management, is intense. ING Group's ability to attract and retain key personnel, in senior management and in particular areas such as technology and operational management, client relationship management, finance, risk and product development, is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent.\n\nThe (increasing) restrictions on remuneration, plus the public and political scrutiny especially in the Netherlands, will continue to have an impact on existing ING Group remuneration policies and individual remuneration packages for personnel. For example, unde r the EU's amended Shareholder Rights Directive, known as 'SRD II', which came into effect on June 10, 2019, ING is required to hold a shareholder (binding) vote on ING's Executive Board remuneration policy and Supervisory Board remuneration policy at least every four years. Furthermore the shareholders have an advisory vote on ING's remuneration report annually. This may restrict our ability to offer competitive compensation compared with companies (financial and/or non-financial) that are not subject to such restrictions and it could adversely affect ING Group's ability to retain or attract key personnel, which, in turn, may affect our business and results.\n\nWe may incur further liabilities in respect of our defined benefit retirement plans if the value of plan assets is not sufficient to cover potential obligations, including as a result of differences between actual results and underlying actuarial assumptions and models.\n\nING Group companies operate various defined benefit retirement plans covering the post-employment benefits of a number of our employees. The liability recognised in our consolidated balance sheet in respect of our defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of each plan's assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised past service costs. We determine our defined benefit plan obligations based on internal and external actuarial models and calculations using the projected unit credit method. Inherent in these actuarial models are assumptions, including discount rates, rates of increase in future salary and benefit levels, mortality rates and consumer price index. These assumptions are based on available market data and are updated annually. Nevertheless, the actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from actual results due to changes in market conditions, economic and mortality trends and other assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our present and future liabilities and costs associated with our defined benefit plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\n## Risks related to the Group's risk management practices\n\nRisks relating to our use of quantitative models or assumptions to model client behaviour for the purposes of our market calculations may adversely impact our reputation or results.\n\nWe use quantitative methods, systems or approaches that apply statistical, economic financial, or mathematical theories, techniques and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates. Errors in the development, implementation, use or interpretation of such models, or from incomplete or incorrect data, can lead to inaccurate, noncompliant or misinterpreted model outputs, which may adversely impact our reputation and results. In addition, we use assumptions in order to model client behaviour for the risk calculations in our banking books. Assumptions are used to determine the interest rate risk profile of savings and current accounts and to estimate the embedded option risk in the mortgage and investment portfolios. Assumptions based on past client behaviour may not always be a reliable indicator of future behaviour. The realisation or use of different assumptions to determine client behaviour could have a material adverse effect on the calculated risk figures and, ultimately, our future results or reputation. Furthermore, we may be subject to risks related to changes in the laws and regulations governing the risk management practices of financial institutions. For further information, see 'Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group Changes in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our o perating costs and limit our activities' above. As noted there, regulation of the industries in which we operates is becoming increasingly more extensive and complex, while also attracting supervisory scrutiny. Compliance failures may lead to changes in the laws and regulations governing the risk management practices and materially increase our operating costs.\n\nWe may be unable to manage our risks successfully through derivatives.\n\nWe employ various economic hedging strategies with the objective of mitigating the market risks that are inherent in our business and operations. These risks include currency fluctuations, changes in the fair value of our investments, the impact of interest rates, equity markets and credit spread changes, the occurrence of credit defaults and changes in client behaviour. We seek to control these risks by, among other things, entering into a number of derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures\n\nand forward contracts, including, from time to time, macro hedges for parts of our business, either directly as a counterparty or as a credit support provider to affiliate counterparties. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with these risks is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with those fluctuations. Our hedging strategies also rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, general market factors and the creditworthiness of our counterparties that may prove to be incorrect or prove to be inadequate. Accordingly, our hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results or financial condition. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risks and losses. Hedging strategies involve transaction costs and other costs, and if we terminate a hedging arrangement, we may also be required to pay additional costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. There have been periods in the past, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we have incurred or may incur losses on transactions, possibly significant, after taking into account our hedging strategies. Further, the nature and timing of our hedging transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. Hedging instruments we use to manage product and other risks might not perform as intended or expected, which could result in higher (un)realised losses, such as credit value adjustment risks or unexpected P&L effects, and unanticipated cash needs to collateralise or settle such transactions. Adverse market conditions can limit the availability and increase the costs of hedging instruments, and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. In addition, hedging counterparties may fail to perform their obligations, resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralised. As such, our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use or may use may not adequately mitigate or offset the risks they intend to cover, and our hedging transactions may result in losses.\n\nOur hedging strategy additionally relies on the assumption that hedging counterparties remain able and willing to provide the hedges required by our strategy. Increased regulation, market shocks, worsening market conditions (whether due to the ongoing euro crisis or otherwise), and/or other factors that affect or are perceived to affect the financial condition, liquidity and creditworthiness of ING may reduce the ability and/or willingness of such counterparties to engage in hedging contracts with us and/or other parties, affecting our overall ability to hedge our risks and adversely affecting our business, results and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\n## Risks related to the Group's liquidity and financing activities\n\nWe depend on the capital and credit markets, as well as customer deposits, to provide the liquidity and capital required to fund our operations, and adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets, or significant withdrawals of customer deposits, may impact our liquidity, borrowing and capital positions, as well as the cost of liquidity, borrowings and capital.\n\nAdverse capital market conditions have in the past affected, and may in the future affect, our cost of borrowed funds and our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis, thereby impacting our ability to support and/or grow our businesses. Furthermore, although interest rates are at or near historically low levels, since the recent financial crisis, we have experienced increased funding costs due in part to the withdrawal of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has also been negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to new regulations.\n\nWe need liquidity to fund new and recurring business, to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations and our business will suffer. The principal sources of our funding include a variety of short-and long-term instruments, including deposit fund, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium- and longterm debt, subordinated debt securities, capital securities and shareholders' equity.\n\nIn addition, because we rely on customer deposits to fund our business and operations, the confidence of customers in financial institutions may be tested in a manner that may adversely impact our liquidity and capital position. Consumer confidence in financial institutions may, for example, decrease due to our or our compet itors' failure to communicate to customers the terms of, and the benefits to customers of, complex or high-fee financial products. Reduced confidence could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position through withdrawal of deposits, in addition to our revenues and results. Because a significant percentage of our customer deposit base is originated via Internet banking, a loss of customer confidence may result in a rapid withdrawal of deposits over the Internet.\n\nIn the event that our current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may need to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Also see u nder the heading 'Ratings are important to our business for a number of reasons, and a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our results and net results'. Similarly, our access to funds may be limited if r egulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, there is a risk that we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favourable terms, or at all. Any actions we might take to access financing may, in turn, cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.\n\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital. Such market conditions may in the future limit our ability to raise additional capital to support business growth, or to counterbalance the consequences of losses or increased regulatory capital and rating agency capital requirements. This could force us to (i) delay raising capital, (ii) reduce, cancel or postpone payment of dividends on our shares, (iii) reduce, cancel or postpone interest payments on our other securities, (iv) issue capital of different types or under different terms than we would otherwise, or (v) incur a higher cost of capital than in a more stable market environment. This would have the potential to decrease both our profitability and our financial flexibility. Our results, financial condition, cash flows, regulatory capital and rating agency capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory liquidity requirements in certain jurisdictions in which we operate are remain stringent, undermining our efforts to maintain centralised management of our liquidity. These developments may cause trapped pools of liquidity and capital, resulting in inefficiencies in the cost of managing our liquidity and solvency, and hinder our efforts to integrate our balance sheet. An example of such trapped liquidity includes our operations in Germany where German regulations impose separate liquidity requirements that restrict ING's ability to move a liquidity surplus out of the German subsidiary.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\nAs a holding company, ING Groep N.V. is dependent for liquidity on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to regulatory and other restrictions on their ability to transact with affiliates.\n\nING Groep N.V. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments to its shareholders and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt service obligations.\n\nING Groep N.V.'s ability to obtain funds to meet its obligations depends on legal and regulatory restrictions applicable to I NG Groep N.V.'s subsidiaries. Many of ING Groep N.V.'s direct and indirect subsidiaries, including certain subsidiaries of ING Bank N.V., may be subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, as well as requirements with respect to capital and liquidity levels. For example, certain local governments and regulators have taken steps and may take further steps to 'ring fence' or impose minimum internal total loss-absorbing capacity on the local affiliates of a foreign financial institution in order to protect clients and creditors of such affiliates in the event of financial difficulties involving such affiliates or the broader banking group. Increased local regulation and supervision have therefore limited and may in the future further limit the ability to move capital and liquidity among affiliated entities and between ING Groep N.V. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, limit the flexibility to structure intercompany and external activities of ING as otherwise deemed most operationally efficient, and increase in the overall level of capital and liquidity required by ING on a consolidated basis.\n\nLower earnings of a local entity may also reduce the ability of such local entity to make dividends and distributions to ING Groep N.V. Other restrictions, such as restrictions on payments from subsidiaries or limitations on the use of funds in client accounts, may also apply to distributions to ING Groep N.V. from its subsidiaries.\n\nING Groep N.V. has also in the past and may in the future continue to guarantee the payment obligations of some of its subsidiaries, including ING Bank N.V. Any such guarantees may require ING Groep N.V. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or the creditors or counterparties of these subsidiaries at a time when the guaranteed subsidiary is in need of liquidity to fund their own obligations.\n\nFinally, ING Groep N.V., as the resolution entity of ING, has an obligation to remove impediments to resolution and to improve resolvability. Regulatory authorities have required and may continue to require ING to increase capital or liquidity levels at the level of the resolution entity or at particular subsidiaries. This may result in, among other things, the issuance of additional long-term debt issuance at the level of ING Groep N.V. or particular subsidiaries.\n\n## Additional risks relating to ownership of ING shares\n\nHolders of ING shares may experience dilution of their holdings.\n\nING's AT1 Securities may, under certain circumstances, convert into equity securities, and such conversion would dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of ING shares and such dilution could be substantial. Additionally, any conversion, or the anticipation of the possibility of a conversion, could depress the market price of ING shares. Furthermore, we may undertake future equity offerings with or without subscription rights. In case of equity offerings with subscription rights, holders of ING shares in certain jurisdictions, however, may not be entitled to exercise such rights unless the rights and the related shares are registered or qualified for sale under the relevant legislation or regulatory framework. Holders of ING shares in these jurisdictions may suffer dilution of their shareholding should they not be permitted to, or otherwise chose not to, participate in future equity offerings with subscription rights.\n\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and many of the members of our Supervisory and Executive Board and our officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult to enforce judgments against ING or the members of our Supervisory and Executive Boards or our officers.\n\nMost of our Supervisory Board members, our Executive Board members and some of the experts named in this Annual Report, as well as many of our officers are persons who are not residents of the United States, and most of our and their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, investors may not be able to serve process on those persons within the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in US courts against us or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the US securities laws.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\nInvestors also may not be able to enforce judgments of US courts under the US federal securities laws in courts outside the United States, including the Netherlands. The United States and the Netherlands do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court. However, under current practice, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdictions, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii) is not contrary to the public policy of the Netherlands, and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Netherlands court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a foreign court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is not capable of being recognized in the Netherlands. It is uncertain whether this practice extends to default judgments as well.\n\nBased on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that U.S. investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named herein who are  residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the U.S. federal securities laws.\n\nIn addition, there is doubt as to whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We report on areas of our business and operations where we can have a material impact both inside and outside our organisation.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board share the ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the annual report, including disclosures on material topics. For more information on our annual reporting governance refer to the 'About this report' chapter.\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nThe overarching principles governing our approach to sustainability are set out in ING's global Sustainability Direction. The global head of Sustainability reports directly to a member of the Management Board Banking (MBB). Specific responsibilities are delegated, via the global Sustainability department, to business units and subject-matter experts who help develop policies, programmes and targets in response to sustainability-related risks and opportunities, in line with the global Sustainability Direction. Progress on identified priorities is communicated regularly to the MBB and to external stakeholders through ING's quarterly reports.\n\nResponsibility for our various sustainability targets lies either with the MBB member responsible for that specific area, or with the MBB as a whole. For example, responsibility for reducing ING's own operational environmental footprint, managed via the environmental programme, lies with the chief operations officer (COO). The COO sponsors the environmental programme and oversees our performance, including policies, implementation and continuous improvement. The programme ensures that the targets are integrated within the relevant business functions, and if necessary, translated to policy. For more information, please see ' Environmental performance' on ing.com . The MBB's overall responsibility for social and environmental risks and opportunities is formalised in the Executive Board Charter. Our sustainability governance, covering climate and human rights topics, is detailed on ing.com.\n\n## Understanding what matters most\n\nING identifies topics that have the most impact on our business and are of the highest priority for stakeholders in our value chain. This process allows us to prioritise and focus on the most material topics and effectively address these in our policies, programmes and targets.\n\nIn 2020 we conducted a materiality assessment, consisting of global peer, media, trend and regulatory analyses. The process was aligned with the guidelines and standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), resulting in a list of material topics. The 2019 materiality analysis outcomes served as the basis for our 2020 analysis. The core of this year's process was a validation using internal and external data sources while ensuring the principles of completeness, accuracy and relevance. The process included the following inputs:\n\n- \u25aa Internal and external stakeholder perspectives;\n- \u25aa The results of an internal risk assessment conducted in 2020;\n- \u25aa ING's Think Forward strategy;\n- \u25aa Industry trend reports from think-tanks and thought leaders;\n- \u25aa Regulatory developments.\n\nThe aggregation of these inputs provided preliminary results which were validated in peer and media analyses. As a result, ' Environmental and social risk managemen t' was added as a material topic. ' Employee development ' , a topic on our 2019 materiality long list, passed our inclusion threshold this year. We renamed the following material topics without changes to their scope to improve clarity:\n\n- \u25aa ' IT systems & platforms ' became 'System availability'\n- \u25aa ' Usability and accessibility ' became 'Customer experience'\n- \u25aa ' Climate Change ' became 'Climate resilience'\n\nThe process received reasonable assurance from audit firm KPMG. We introduce the 2020 material topics in the 'World around us' chapter and link them to chapters of this report in 'Our strategy' .\n\n<!-- image -->",

The environmental impact of our operations mainly consists of energy use in buildings and IT systems, business travel, waste and water.\n\nIn April 2020, ING announced new global targets for reducing our operational footprint. To underpin our programme and global targets, we have successfully developed our environmental management system (EMS). Our EMS continues to help us to make progress against our 2022 and 2030 targets and to integrate the programme throughout our business activities and operations. Our new targets were developed prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, and we are analysing the potential short, mid and longterm impacts of the pandemic on our operations and environmental performance. Much of the decrease in carbon emissions, water and residual waste, reached in 2020 was due to Covid pandemic-related restrictions on travel and working from home.\n\n## Our commitments:\n\n- \u25aa We will reduce our scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions from our buildings and data centres by 80 percent by year-end 2022, and 90 percent by year-end 2030 (base year 2014).\n- \u25aa We will reduce our scope 3 CO2e emissions from business travel by airplane and car by 25 percent by year-end 2022 (base year 2014).\n- \u25aa We will reduce energy consumption by 65 percent by year-end 2030 (new target, base year 2014).\n- \u25aa We will reduce our global residual waste by 26 percent by year-end 2022 (base year 2014).\n- \u25aa We will reduce our water footprint by 26 percent by 2022 (base year 2014).\n- \u25aa We will continue to procure 100 percent renewable electricity for all ING buildings where we have management control worldwide.\n- \u25aa We will remain carbon neutral by offsetting remaining carbon emissions.\n- \u25aa We will preferably procure green energy from local renewable projects: electricity supplied by energy sources that are naturally and continually replenished, such as wind, solar power, geothermal and hydropower.\n- \u25aa We will maintain a standard for transparency about our progress by disclosing material environmental performance indicators in our annual report.\n\n## Our progress:\n\n- \u25aa Our extrapolated CO2e emissions of Scope 1 & 2 decreased by 76 percent in 2020 relative to our base year of 2014.\n- \u25aa Our extrapolated CO2e emissions of Scope 3 decreased by 73 percent in 2020 relative to our base year of 2014.\n- \u25aa Our residual waste decreased by 52 percent in 2020 relative to our base year.\n- \u25aa Our water consumption decreased by 27 percent in 2020 relative to our base year.\n- \u25aa We reached 100 percent proportion of renewable electricity consumption as a percentage of total electricity consumption.\n- \u25aa We maintained carbon-neutral operations in 2020 by offsetting emissions caused by business travel and non-renewable energy use.\n- \u25aa We maintained ISO14001 certification.\n\nWe offset 100 percent of our operational carbon emissions through the purchase of Voluntary Carbon Units (VCUs), with the majority originating from a high impact Acre Amazonian Rainforest REDD+ Portfolio in Brazil. This collection of three projects prevents deforestation across 105,000 hectares of pristine rainforest in the Amazon basin by promoting sustainable economic livelihoods. By granting land tenure and providing agricultural training to local communities, trees are kept standing, drawing down carbon from the atmosphere and protecting the area's rich biodiversity. The portfolio is verified and validated to the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), and has achieved Gold Level status under the Climate Community and Biodiversity (CCB) Standard.\n\nFind out more about the environmental programme on ing.com.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CO2e (CO2  equivalent) denotes the conversion of greenhouse gases into the equivalent radiant force of CO2 based on their respective global warming potentials (GWP) at a 100-year time-horizon. For conversion factors, we utilize the DEFRA 2020 GWP factors.\n\n2 Scope 1 emissions comprises emissions from our use of natural gas and fuel oil, and Scope 2 comprises emissions from our use of electricity, renewable electricity and district heating. Data collated in scope 1 and 2 only comprises the energy used in buildings where ING has management control and includes office buildings, data centers and retail branches. For electricity generation and heating oil the 2020 International Energy Agency emissions factors are used. For natural gas, district heat and transmission losses, we employ emissions factors from DEFRA 2020.\n\n3 Our Scope 3 emissions comprise emissions from business travel by air and car. Emissions through our lending and investments (Scope 3, category 15) are reported using carbon intensity metrics in annual Terra progress reports, available for download at ing.com. For air travel, we gather information on short, medium and long-haul flights. When hauls are unknown, an average is used. For air travel we employ emissions factors from DEFRA 2020. For car travel data is derived from business travel of lease cars, rentals and declared kms when private vehicles are used for business travel. As lease cars are also utilized by employees for private purposes, we assume that 30% of all kms driven in lease cars are for business purposes. This is the reported number unless a different threshold is applied locally. Car emissions factors for business and logistics from the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom have been updated using a bespoke emissions factor. This factor is based on local country data from our car lease supplier on the respective average fuel efficiency of a country's vehicle fleet. We also apply a 34% uplift to these figures in line with DEFRA guidelines. For countries where local data is not available on vehicle efficiency we apply the standard 2020 DEFRA emission factor for road vehicles.\n\nActivity data is gathered through an online Data Management System (DMS) and is initiated and overseen by the global ING sustainability department. The DMS is built and hosted by a specialty sustainability software company, CREDIT360. Credit360 is ING's proprietary tool used for calculating CO2e and emissions extrapolations.",

In revising our ESR policies, we follow a structured consultation process and proactively seek input from our stakeholders. In line with our Sustainability Direction we contribute to multiple international initiatives and cooperate as a member of platforms such as the Equator Principles Association and the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). We seek external direction and validation of our sustainability priorities by endorsing international frameworks such as the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. An overview of partnerships, memberships and endorsements is available at https://www.ing.com/Sustainability/The-worldaround-us-1/Memberships.htm.\n\nWe define stakeholders as organisations or individuals who may be directly or indirectly impacted by ING's activities or who may have an impact on ING's activities or ability to provide products and services, as well as their legitimate representatives. ING continually engages stakeholders, including those who temporarily manifest themselves or express interest in a topic can also have a relevant input. Throughout the year, challenges and issues are discussed with various stakeholders. Below we highlight some key issues addressed in 2020.\n\n## Engagement cases 2020\n\n## NGO concerns over impacts of ship breaking in Asia\n\nLate 2019, NGO Oxfam Novib raised its concerns regarding the end-of-life ship management practices of an offshore oil and gas service provider. ING invited the NGO to share its concerns with ING to be discussed in our engagements with the client, which they kindly did. Under the Dutch Banking sector Agreement, ING provided in-detail feedback of the engagement process with Oxfam in 2020. Due to client confidentiality considerations, the outcome of the engagements could not be shared.\n\nIn response to the above event, ING conducted portfolio analysis to understand its indirect exposure to ship breaking activities. We are reviewing the results and expect to decide on next steps in 2021.\n\n## Controversy around project in Angola\n\nIn January 2020, stakeholders expressed their concern over alleged human rights violations relating to an INGfinanced project off the coast of Angola's capital Luanda.\n\nIn 2016, ING joined two other banks to provide a loan to the Angolan Ministry of Finance for dredging activities by Dutch contractor Van Oord. The Dutch government, through insurer Atradius Dutch State Business, provided credit insurance. ING conducts a thorough due diligence process before committing to projects like this. During the due diligence process it became clear tha t Van Oord's consortium partner was connected to Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola. We ensured the loan was exclusively intended for dredging and that no finance reached the consortium partner. All payments under the loan were made directly to Van Oord.\n\nING had conducted thorough due diligence based on an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) report. The ESIA concluded that the project did not require the physical resettlement of local communities, though stated the need for financial compensation of local fishermen. However, in early 2020 ING was informed that approximately 3,000 families in the project area had been resettled in 2013 as part of another project, before Van Oord started its activities in Angola and years before ESIA experts visited the project site.\n\nING condemns the practice of forced evictions. Resettlement of communities is only to take place in exceptional cases and only with due care and in accordance with best practice. Fair compensation and preferably livelihood restauration should be provided by the party performing the resettlement.\n\n## Oil exploration in the Arctic\n\nIn February 2020, Dutch research provider for the civil society sector Profundo and local NGOs Greenpeace and Fair Finance Guide published the report Oliewinning bij de Noordpool (Oil production in the North Pole) focused on the Arctic oil and gas exploration activities of the world's oil majors. The report alleges that Dutch pension funds and banks support Arctic oil and gas exploration directly and indirectly through their loans and investments in the oil majors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    {
        "page_content": "- > Non-financial appendix\n\nING does not provide project finance services for offshore oil and gas exploration or production in the Arctic. We have limited indirect exposure to certain activities in the Artic through our clients. These may include equipment supplies for oil and gas companies and the transportation of goods and supplies for oil and gas companies.\n\n## Amazon deforestation\n\nIn August 2020, NGOs World Animal Protection and Fair Finance Guide Netherlands, relying on data from civil society research provider Profundo, published the report Funding destruction of the Amazon and the Cerrado savannah . The report draws links between deforestation from cattle ranching and soy production in Brazil and soft commodity producers and traders. The report accuses Dutch pension funds and banks of complicity in deforestation.\n\nING recognises that commodity traders such as those listed in the report face supply chain risks, which is why our Environmental and Social Risk (ESR) policy envisages enhanced due diligence of supply chains. As part of our due diligence processes, ING re-assesses clients running high risks on a yearly basis. In our engagements with the soft commodities sector ING addresses sector best practices including commodity certifications.\n\n## Gender equality in the banking sector\n\nIn May 2020, Dutch NGO Fair Finance Guide, relying on data from local civil society research provider Profundo, released a report accusing Dutch banks of insufficient gender equality due diligence of their clients and among their own workforce. The report, From glass ceilings to factory floors: Dutch banks' actions on gender , considers the banks' credit exposure to the construction, mining, electronics, paper and forestry and apparel sectors to be a proxy for financing gender inequality. The report also assesses women representation at the board level and concludes this to be insufficient in the Dutch banking sector.\n\nWe value diversity and inclusion. That's why we have introduced the 70% principle. It gives managers a basis for building mixed teams around appropriate dimensions of diversity. While we recognise we have work to do, we've made progress which is recognised by third party initiatives like the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. The Index features companies committed to an equal and inclusive workplace.\n\n## Mining in Mexico\n\nIn October 2020, a civil society organisation representing a local community, surrounding a mine in Mexico, reached out to ING regarding a client and community benefit agreement. The local community sought dialogue with ING on the mining company's agreement, for which it was seeking new terms and had blocked the mine operations.\n\nAs one of the mining company's lenders, ING met with peer banks to discuss the issue and to jointly engage the client on the local community's concerns. Though ING does not directly finance the mine in question, we engaged with the local community to hear their concerns. The open dialogue with impacted rights holders and the mining company led to an improved understanding of the situation on the ground.\n\n## Oil and gas production in the Ecuadorian Amazon\n\nIn August 2020, NGOs Stand.Earth and Amazon Watch released the report European Banks Financing Trade of Controversial Amazon Oil to the U.S . The report describes how much of the oil production in Ecuador takes place in the Amazon Sacred Headwaters region in the western Amazon; one of the birthplaces of the Amazon River and home to more than 500,000 Indigenous people, of some of which are living in voluntary isolation on their ancestral lands.\n\nING does not finance the exploration or production of oil and gas in the Amazon in Ecuador. ING does finances the trade of commodities, including Ecuadorian oil. In response to concerns expressed by local indigenous people, considering the risks to people in isolation in times of the pandemic, and the potential impact of oil exploration on the surrounding ecosystem, ING decided to conduct a review of its indirect exposure via Ecuadorian oil trade. While this review takes place ING will not enter into new contractual agreements for the financing of oil and gas trade flows from Ecuador.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On a dedicated site, WWF provides access to an interactive tool which can be used to assess and track banks' performance on ESG integration, based on all public disclosures issued by each bank. Any improvements or regressions in performance compared to the previous year are also displayed. ING marked an improvement over 2020 and is in the leading group of international banks. The tool aims to highlight the potential for the financial sector to drive sustainable development in ASEAN and beyond. It also aspires to provide a decision-useful assessment framework that incorporates environmental and social issues most relevant to the ASEAN region.\n\n<!-- image -->",
