Monthly US ethanol production rates improved gradually from the trough in April/May but still ended the year well below 2019 levels.\n\nBioenergy's performance in North America ended roughly in line with the estimated industry development. Increased market penetration with yeast solutions, for example, and the continued expansion of corn-based ethanol production capacity in Brazil and China contributed positively to fullyear sales.\n\n## 2021 outlook\n\nOrganic sales growth in 2021 is expected to be driven by a gradual recovery in the US ethanol industry, following the severe disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe mid-point of the Bioenergy organic sales range roughly corresponds to mid-single digit growth in the US ethanol production.

The remaining 10% was reinvested in  Novozymes to develop the company, build competitive strength and ensure future value generation for distribution among key stakeholders.\n\nI n 2020 Novozymes returned 12% of the value generated to our capital providers. The main part of this was our dividend payment of DKK 1,483 million. In addition to the 12%, Novozymes bought back shares worth 1,500 million in 2020.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Novo Nordisk Foundation owned - through Novo Holdings A/S - 25.5% of the share in Novozymes (see The Novozymes Stock). The Novo Nordisk Foundation's objective is to support scientific, social and humanitarian purposes, and the Foundation contributes to communities in large scale through donations and impact investments, to which we indirectly contribute through our dividend payments.\n\n## A responsible approach to tax\n\nNovozymes' tax policy supports a positive tax contribution to society and governments. The group continuously works to fulfill its tax obligations in the countries in which it operates. We seek to obtain a competitive tax level in a responsible manner, and with full regard to national and international laws and regulations. Besides taxes, our economic contributions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninclude duties, VAT, employee taxes, employee pension and benefit programs, procurement from local vendors and job creation.\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes incurred corporate income taxes and other taxes and duties that amounted to approximately DKK 1,450 million. In addition, Novozymes collected and withheld tax contributions on dividends and wages totaling approximately DKK 1,400 million. Novozymes' total tax contribution therefore amounted to approximately DKK 2,850 million, compared with approximately DKK 3,000 million in 2019.\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nTax is a core part of corporate responsibility and governance at Novozymes. The Board of Directors approves the tax policy and is accountable for it. Novozymes is committed to being open and transparent about its tax policy and tax affairs. We provide regular information to our stakeholders about our approach to tax and taxes paid.\n\nNovozymes supports and complies with the transparency requirements on taxes, including the OECD Country-by-Country tax initiative.

We have reorganized the company intending to move even closer to our customers and solidify our position as the leading provider of biotech solutions. Having laid the foundation for future growth, we believe Novozymes is in a strong position going into 2021.\n\nMessage from the Chair and the CEO continues on the next page\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "T here has not been a year like 2020 in recent memory. And while we did not see the sales growth we wanted, we're extremely proud of the way our employees have handled these difficult circumstances. The advances we made during the year are a testament to Novozymes' strong purpose, culture and welldiversified business model.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has proven to affect industries differently, and our diversified business helped us to withstand at least some of the effects of the pandemic. In 2020, Household Care delivered solid growth driven by the rollout of the Freshness platform, growth in emerging markets and COVID-19 induced changes to consumer behavior. In Food, Beverages & Human Health, food and human health grew while beverages declined. At the same time, organic sales declined in Bioenergy and Grain & Tech Processing as COVID-19 impacts severely affected ethanol and textile production.\n\nOur organic sales growth came in at 0% for the year, and the reported EBIT margin was a solid 26.1% despite currency headwinds. We also achieved very strong cash generation with free cash flow at DKK 3.4 billion before acquisitions.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed many things, but at Novozymes we did not lose focus on creating the best possible foundation for a business that is here for the long term.\n\n## Customer-focused and solutions-driven\n\nWe reorganized Novozymes in September, refocusing the company around our customers and geographies. As we continue to build on\n\nour strategy, Better business with biology, this new setup leads to reduced complexity, increased accountability, faster decisionmaking and empowers our employees to a greater degree.\n\nWe now organize around two new divisions, Consumer Biosolutions and Agriculture & Industrial Biosolutions, headed by Anders Lund and Tina Sejersg\u00e5rd Fan\u00f8 respectively to better align with the very specific drivers and challenges influencing customers across the wide range of industries we serve.\n\nFor years, Novozymes has been associated mainly with the production of enzymes, but the reality is that we provide a range of solutions within the biotech space. What our customers need may be an enzyme, a microbe, a yeast or even a digital solution. For example, in Bioenergy, we not only supply customers with enzymes or yeast for bioethanol production, we also have the digital tools to ensure optimal conditions for applying our solutions during our customer's production process. We always take a holistic approach to market needs and provide our customers with the exact solution - or combination of solutions - that will help them succeed.\n\nAs part of the reorganization, we aligned our regional commercial set-up and created new roles, especially in emerging markets, to get closer to where our customers are. We have also ensured a stronger regional voice in core decision-making processes. As a global company, it is vital that employees in all regions are able to accelerate decisions and offer tailor-made solutions to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'When I look at Novozymes, I see a healthy and wellpositioned company with a strong technology platform and impressive innovation capabilities. I also see a potential for more, and my goal is to fully unleash the true potential of the company.'\n\n## Ester Baiget\n\nCEO\n\n## Changes to the Executive Leadership Team composition\n\nWe brought in new members to the Executive Leadership team. Claus Crone Fuglsang, Head of our Research & Development organization, and Graziela Chaluppe dos Santos Malucelli, Head of Operations, Supply & Quality, were both appointed executive vice president and joined the Executive Leadership Team this year, creating a stronger connection between the back and front ends of our company.\n\nWe also announced the appointment of Amy Byrick as Executive Vice President of Strategy & Business Transformation and of Morten Enggaard Rasmussen as Executive Vice President of People, Sustainability & Brand. They will join Novozymes in April 2021, and we look forward to seeing them make their mark on these very important areas for Novozymes' future. They will both succeed Thomas Videb\u00e6k, who will be leaving Novozymes in 2021. We are immensely grateful for everything Thomas has contributed to Novozymes during his many years with the company and we wish him well in the future.\n\n## Embracing our responsibility\n\nAt Novozymes, sustainability is at the root of our solutions. We use biotechnology to enable our customers to deliver more sustainable solutions to society. Every day, in over 30 industries and 130 countries, our enzymes and microbes help reduce energy, water, chemical and raw material consumption, help improve performance of customer products and give people healthier and more sustainable choices for living better lives. By laying the foundation for a sound business and future growth we are, by default, also ensuring a more sustainable future for the world.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, for example, we launched Taegro \u00ae in Europe and Latin America in collaboration with Syngenta, providing farmers with a chemical-free fungicide that protects fruit and vegetables from disease, thereby reducing waste in the food production cycle. We also launched Protana\u00ae Prime, a biological solution that enhances the umami flavor of plantbased products, thereby enabling producers to accommodate consumer demand for tasty, greener alternatives to meat-based foods. But our responsibility does not stop with delivering innovative, sustainable solutions to our customers. In our own production, we continue to do everything we can to reduce the negative impact of our production processes. We are proud to have ensured that, in 2020, 69% of our electricity globally came from renewable sources. We also partnered with WWF to assess and address water risks at our sites by setting up targets for the sustainable management of water in our production.\n\nThese achievements are steps on our journey towards becoming even more sustainable, and we need to keep up a determined pace to honor our commitments to our customers, consumers and the world.\n\n## Working together\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on many communities and, as a responsible corporate citizen, Novozymes stepped in where possible. We worked together with the Novo Nordisk Foundation to get the COVID-19 testing capacity up and running in Denmark. In other parts of the world, we made direct donations to NGOs, either monetary or in the form of essential equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'While the pandemic we are currently facing is an urgent and immediate crisis, we must not lose sight of the long-term needs of the world. Novozymes' purpose is now more relevant than ever, and in 2020 we moved closer to unlocking the full potential of the company.'\n\n## J\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen\n\nChair\n\nOur primary focus during this uncertain year has been to keep our employees safe whether they were working in production, in labs or from home. Novozymes' employees have shown so much care for each other, and we want to acknowledge what a fantastic job they have done. Through our Inspire program, our employees have also managed to reach out to their communities and help those in need, whether it be collecting funds for disadvantaged people or offering their skills to educate children virtually.\n\nThe promotion of equal opportunities for all people has been on Novozymes' agenda for many years, but we can still do more. There are always new aspects or new groups of people and backgrounds to consider when prioritizing diversity. It is important to consider diversity and inclusion in all aspects of business. That also applies in times of change, so to strengthen the collective capabilities of our dedicated employees, we set diversity criteria for everyone involved in the formation of new roles and teams during our re-organization in September. We also collaborated with America's Job Exchange to reach a more diverse pool of candidates with our job ads, and we set up focus groups with employees to discuss where we are, where we want to be, and how we intend to get there. A truly diverse workforce will contribute to driving change and building a thriving culture.\n\n## Thank You\n\nWe want to thank all our stakeholders for what we were able to achieve together in a year unlike any we have ever seen before. In times of change, everything is magnified, whether it is your weaknesses or your strengths. This year has proven to us that Novozymes has\n\nstrong partnerships with customers, a resilient portfolio and committed employees who are able to adapt and be innovative in challenging times. That's a great foundation from which to grow.\n\nWe expect that we will return to growth in 2021, supported by a more streamlined organization, stronger commercial presence, innovation, as well as a gradual recovery in those areas adversely affected by the pandemic. Based on this, we have set a sales growth expectation of between 2% to 6% in 2021, provided we do not see another extended global lockdown.\n\nWe look forward to working with our customers to find, develop and champion sustainable solutions to the challenges we all face.\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEster Baiget CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

By enhancing and expanding the use of digital tools, we were able to improve collaboration within the organization, strengthen customer relationships and drive new leads without notable interruption.\n\nOur webinar platform - a tool to help our employees conduct webinars for existing and potential customers - has proven effective in gaining leads that would previously have been hard to reach. The data and insights collected from webinars have been used to nurture new and existing customers along the customer decision journey.\n\nIn Brewing, we strived to reach out to more, smaller breweries using digital tools. On the website Brewing with enzymes, we share the benefits of introducing enzymes into the craft brewing process and potential customers can enter a live chat with experts.\n\nCOVID-19 is also on the minds of many of our customers, and we reached out to the American laundry market with articles and webinars about cleaning and buying habits and trends shaped by the pandemic. In China, we embraced new and effective ways of customer engagement by shifting online\n\namid the pandemic. We hosted livestreams on the Alibaba 1688 online platform which attracted thousands of unique visitors, and we will continue to strengthen the partnership between Novozymes and Alibaba. The launch of Microvia\u2122, our bacterial bio-cleaning solution for hard surface cleaners, addresses an increased focus on safe, effective solutions for cleaning at home and at work during the pandemic and is a showcase for our capabilities in the relatively new space of probiotic cleaners.\n\nSeveral of our bioethanol customers saw the demand for ethanol rise as the need for hand sanitizers and disinfectants increased dramatically during the pandemic. We supported customers who donated ethanol for the production of hand sanitizers and disinfectants by offering them free input products for the ethanol production.\n\nAlthough 2020 was a unique year, there have been learnings we take with us to stay agile, efficient and responsive to customers.\n\n## Maturing human health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS ince 2019, we have been investing in what we call strategic opportunity areas - or SOAs. Finding biological solutions for improved human oral and gut health is one such SOA and has been a key focus in 2020.\n\nBioFresh \u00ae 4+ was launched in December under the Novozymes OneHealth brand. Novozymes established the Novozymes OneHealth brand to market solutions within human health under one umbrella, with consumer insights at the heart of product development. Studies show that up to 50% of consumers have been concerned about bad breath at some point in their life*. BioFresh \u00ae 4+ is a tablet for oral use which helps reduce bad breath and is effective for up to 4 hours. The only enzymatic solution of its kind on the market, it addresses a growing gap between consumers' expectations of oral care products and the current offerings available on the market.\n\nIn June, Novozymes acquired PrecisionBiotics Group Limited. Based in Cork, Ireland, PrecisionBiotics Group holds a leading position within probiotics for human gut health and is well positioned with several clinically backed products already on the market.\n\nIn January 2021, we acquired Microbiome Labs, based in Illinois, US.

We continuously strengthen our work on risk management to secure Novozymes' operations, stakeholders and our ability to generate value in the short, medium and long term.\n\nN ovozymes' risk management process is designed to ensure that we identify, assess and mitigate key business risks in a timely manner. We do this to ensure risks do not negatively affect our ability to achieve our targets and deliver value to our stakeholders. In addition to monitoring and addressing our risks, we also monitor longer-term threats and trends. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for overseeing risks and for maintaining a robust risk management and internal control system.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nNovozymes operates an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process whereby the key risks facing the company are identified, assessed and mitigated at different levels of the organization. We monitor most risks by means of biannual reviews, although some risks may materialize within a short period of time and require more frequent updates, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 being a case in point.\n\nThe Risk Management & Controls department is responsible for identifying risks in collaboration\n\n## Risk assessment heat map\n\nPotential impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPr obability\n\nOur four key risks for 2021 are unchanged from 2020: Competition and market consolidation; Volatility of agriculturerelated business; Cyberattacks and Global political and economic instability.\n\nwith the organization and for ensuring that senior management promotes risk awareness, engagement and ownership across the organization. Risks are assessed based on a two-dimensional heat map rating system that estimates the potential impact of a given risk on financials and reputation, and the likelihood of that risk materializing. Each key risk is assigned a risk owner from the Executive Leadership Team and a Risk Responsible, usually a Vice President, responsible for mitigating all risks relevant to their respective areas.\n\nThe most significant risks are reviewed and assessed by the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors, who are also responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control processes throughout the year. In 2020, the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board of Directors, made deep dives into selected risks and risk processes.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the world in 2020, a risk on 'worldwide pandemic disease' is not included as a key risk. In general, pandemic outbreaks are rare events and so have not rated highly on likelihood. The COVID-19 pandemic is currently affecting businesses and will continue to do so in 2021. The Executive Leadership Team will continue to monitor and address potential business risks arising from the COVID-19 situation, e.g., changed consumer behaviors, declining GDP growth, while our global and local crisis response teams safeguard our people and communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee note 5.1 for information on financial risk factors and risk management",

Our position in the market may be challenged by competition from both existing and potential new competitors, sometimes formed through consolidation. We continue to see a risk of competitors operating under less regulated market conditions.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nWe could face increased competition from other enzyme manufacturers offering new solutions or from new players with technology platforms that are broader than ours. With increased digitalization, competition could also relate to how solutions are implemented in customer production. Although consolidation can make the market more stable, it could also increase a competitor's financial strength and bargaining power.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2020, we preserved our market-leading position by introducing new innovations, strengthening our commercial relationships - even during global lockdowns - and re-shaping our organization to be even more customer-centric and value chain focused. As part of our organizational changes in September 2020, we increased regional empowerment to ensure further agility in markets where we see strong potential for our solutions.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to improve our go-tomarket strategies, accelerate regional innovations to strengthen our position in certain markets, nurture partnerships and build on our strong relationships with key customers.\n\n## Volatility of agriculture- related business\n\nNovozymes' agriculture-related business is affected by numerous elements, such as weather conditions, commodity prices, political mandates for ethanol blends, etc. In addition, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty adds to the overall volatility of the industry.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nIn 2020, our bioenergy business in the US experienced a steep decline from a sharp drop in gasoline consumption due to COVID-19 restrictions. If global lockdowns, volatility of the agriculturalrelated markets, and poor global farm economics persist, it could challenge our ability to grow in the industry.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2020, we worked to leverage our industryleading enzyme portfolio in combination with yeast technologies to strengthen our position in the bioethanol industry. In September 2020, we launched Fiberex \u00ae , a platform solution specifically aimed at converting a low-value byproduct - corn fiber - into high-value, cellulosic low-carbon fuel.\n\nWith the move in 2019 to a more flexible go-to-market approach in our agriculture business we find ourselves in a transition phase still. However, we are seeing good traction with partners as exemplified by the second quarter launch of the biocontrol product Taegro \u00ae in Europe and South America, in partnership with Syngenta.\n\nIn 2021, we remain focused on building strong relations with our customers in the agriculture-related business, while also increasing our internal commercial competences, including technical sales support.",

The rapid digitalization of businesses and lack of regulations online drive this trend. Across the world, cybercrime can be seen to offer fast gains at low risk. Preserving business continuity and safeguarding sensitive business data and critical assets against this global threat is extremely important to Novozymes.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nAs a technology-driven company, we rely on the integrity and availability of computers and networks, and the sharing of data. Cybercrime and hacker attacks may negatively impact Novozymes' productivity if systems are inaccessible for an extended period. Furthermore, fast digitalization continuously exposes Novozymes to cybersecurity threats. Business opportunities with customers could be adversely impacted if information about Novozymes' unique technologies or production strains is stolen.\n\nWe actively seek to learn from other companies' experiences and, upon reviewing incidents of cyberattacks and technology developments, we have reassessed and adjusted the potential impact of this risk.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nOur ability to identify, protect, detect and respond to cyberattacks has significantly improved in recent years. In 2020, we gained more quantitative insights into potential security threats and vulnerabilities at Novozymes, enabling us to prioritize efforts and further raise our level of security. Key focus areas have been to test and improve our IT emergency response, implement comprehensive and consistent information risk management and expand our detection capabilities and automation of cyber incident handling to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks.\n\nWhile cyberattacks can be seen to raise the threat of global theft, our more than 6,500 granted or pending patents remain a strong defense of our solutions.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks through an updated security roadmap, specifically Identity and Access Management (IAM), Network & Endpoint protection and data.\n\nAs our operations become even more dependent on digitization and data analytics, we will increase the focus on operational technologies in our production facilities to ensure they stay operational at all times.\n\n## Global political and economic instability\n\nThere continues to be significant instability in the global economy and in the political landscape. Trade conditions are subject to uncertainty and shifts, making it more difficult to mitigate risk. Adding to this, the COVID-19 pandemic has a potential negative impact on global economic growth.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nAs a global company, polarization and trade protectionism can have an adverse impact on Novozymes' ability to operate. Long-term decisionmaking is complicated, both for us and for our customers, if world leaders struggle to agree and to work together to strengthen global and regional institutions.\n\nWe have yet to see the full global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have already felt the effects of lower demand in some areas. We could ultimately see price sensitivity grow among customers and consumers. There is also a risk of exchange rate fluctuations and of customers, partners and suppliers risking or facing insolvency.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes closely monitored political and economic developments, such as the US-China trade negotiations. We emphasized considerations beyond financial analysis, e.g., handling bilateral relations and image/ perception. In addition, we focused on customs handling to ensure fast response and optimizing of customs paid.\n\nPricing continues to be an area of focus in our commercial organization. We have strengthened our focus on generating profitable growth which includes increased pricing transparency and governance. This effort will be further strengthened in 2021 with a cross divisional global focus on pricing.\n\nWe remain engaged in global forums on sustainability, aiming to champion the benefits of globalization and shared commitments, and we continuously promote the importance of working together globally for a sustainable future.\n\nFor 2021 and beyond, the global outlook remains uncertain, as the full impact of e.g. Brexit and COVID-19 remains unclear at the time of writing, and several conflicts need to be settled to ensure political stability and free trade. We will further seek to improve our data analysis and general monitoring for better predictability and speed of reaction.",

Novozymes' commitment to provide the world with biological solutions that can help limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C has been validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\n- \u00b7 We saved 49 million tons of CO2 by enabling low carbon fuels in the transport sector in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a slowdown in the use of liquid transportation fuels. Hence, the demand for ethanol and the resulting reduction of CO 2 emissions has declined this year.\n- \u00b7 In 2020, our Franklinton site in North Carolina, USA purchased Green-e \u00ae certified renewable energy certificates (RECs) from two local solar farms. This purchase covers the full annual electricity\n\n## Key figures\n\nWorld: Reach >4 billion people by providing laundry solutions in 2022 that replace chemicals\n\nOperations: By 2022, develop context-based water management programs at 100% of our sites*\n\nW ater is a scarce resource, and, in many regions, people suffer from lack of access to clean water. Water is also a fundamental component of our production processes, so we must manage our water use responsibly.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\n- \u00b7 In 2020, we progressed towards our Reach target and managed to reach 3.98 billion people with our laundry solutions. This development was mainly driven by increased penetration of enzymatic detergents in Africa and Latin America.\n- \u00b7 We developed context-based water management plans for two sites in China.\n- \u00b7 In September, we partnered with WWF to assess water risks and develop contextual water targets and action plans for our sites globally.\n- \u00b7 Novozymes now endorses the UN Global Compact's CEO Water Mandate which is the leading multi-stakeholder platform driving action on water stewardship. This endorsement reflects how we look at water very differently and with a greater focus today than we did in previous years.\n- *  The target does not include sites with activities not considered to have a significant environmental impact, e.g sales offices, R&D labs, etc.\n\nOperations: By 2022, reduce absolute CO 2 emissions from operations by 40%\n\nconsumption of the site and supported renewables on the local grid in North Carolina. With this, we are now sourcing 69% of our electricity globally from renewables.\n\n- \u00b7 At our Fuglebakken site in Denmark, a newly installed heat pump will be used to transfer excess heat from our operations to the district heating network, delivering heat to around 2,000 households.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The outlook is based on a gradual recovery from the pandemic impact in 2020. An incremental pickup or a further slowdown of the expected gradual recovery,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHousehold Care organic sales growth is expected to be driven by market penetration, focusing on emerging markets and a continued rollout of the Freshness technology, with a broad-market launch in the second half of the year. The broadmarket launch is an important milestone, that is expected to become a significant growth contributor in future years. The 2021 outlook for Household Care builds on improving the underlying performance on top of a better than expected performance in 2020.\n\nBioenergy organic sales growth in 2021 is expected to be driven by a gradual recovery in the US ethanol industry, following the severe disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The mid-point of the Bioenergy organic sales range roughly corresponds to mid-single digit growth in the US ethanol production. The growth contribution from regions outside of the US is expected to be positive.\n\nGrain & Tech Processing organic sales growth is expected to be broadbased, with both grain and tech contributing positively. The grain business is expected to outgrow a roughly flat underlying market, driven by innovation and increased local presence across key regions. Tech is expected to gradually recover after the significant disruption of the global textile industry in 2020.\n\nespecially in the areas most impacted by the pandemic in 2020, would imply a performance in the high- respectively low-end of the outlook range. However, the outlook range would not cover a situation with another extended global lockdown. Sales in reported DKK are expected to be ~1 percentage point less, net of currency and M&A-related effects, compared to the 2-6% organic sales growth outlook. Organic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Food, Beverages & Human Health\n\n2021 organic sales growth is expected to be broad-based. Innovation and emerging market penetration, supported by increasing consumer dietary-health-awareness, are the main drivers of growth in the food business. Beverages is expected to gradually recover following a 2020 severely affected by COVID-19 implications. The PrecisionBiotics Group and Microbiome Labs acquisitions are both estimated to contribute to growth in reported DKK and to grow organically by solid double-digits.\n\nsales in the first quarter is expected to decline by mid-single digits year-on-year following the relatively high comparator of the first quarter of last year, especially in Household Care, Bioenergy and in Food, Beverages & Human Health.\n\nFood, Beverages & Human Health and Grain & Tech Processing are both expected to grow\n\norganically by mid-single-digits while Bioenergy is expected to grow by mid-to-high single digits in 2021. The growth outlook for Household Care is in the low-single-digits following the better than expected performance in 2020. Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition is expected at flat to low-single-digit growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agriculture, Animal Health &\n\nNutrition organic sales performance in 2021 will be driven by the continued expansion of the BioAg business across crops and regions, resulting in solid underlying doubledigit organic sales growth when adjusted for the DKK ~60 million oneoff in the second quarter of 2020. The outlook for Animal Health & Nutrition includes some uncertainty as to stocking levels in the value chain, further accentuated by the pandemic. A strong innovative product portfolio and partnership setup coupled with signs of improving farmer economics make us carefully optimistic about the years to come.",

Hence, the implied underlying EBIT margin for 2021 of 27- 28% should be compared with the underlying 2020 EBIT margin of ~27%, and the underlying 2019 EBIT margin of ~26%. Supportive margin contributions from sales growth and productivity improvements are expected to be partly offset by slightly higher input costs and continued re-investment in the business.\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC), including goodwill, is expected at around 19% (2020: 18.9%; underlying ~20%) and includes negative currency and M&A-related effects totaling roughly 2 percentage points.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) before acquisitions is expected to be in the DKK 2.7-3.1 billion range (2020: DKK 3.4 billion), supported by higher sales and an improved operational cash flow.

The Chairmanship is also responsible for planning and preparing the meetings of the Board. The Board of Directors has three committees: The Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee and the Innovation Committee. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee assists the Board in the nomination of candidates for the Board of Directors, Board committees and the Executive Management as well as in determining the remuneration of Board members, Board committee members and members of the Executive Management. The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing aspects relating to accounting, auditing, risks, internal controls and financial, environmental, social and governance data. The Innovation Committee was created in 2020 and assists the Board with the review of Novozymes' overall capabilities and strategic direction in matters of technology, science and innovation. The Innovation Committee held its inaugural meeting in 2020, where focus was on the corporate innovation pipeline and on the innovation strategy for the OneHealth Brand.\n\nFurther information about the three Board committees can be found at Novozymes.com\n\n## Charters and recommendations\n\nWhen laying down the management principles for Novozymes, the Board of Directors followed the Recommendations on Corporate Governance that form part of the disclosure requirements applicable to companies listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen. These recommendations are available at corporategovernance.dk. A detailed review of Novozymes' position on each of the recommendations and a description of the internal control and risk management system relating to financial reporting can be found in the statutory report on corporate governance prepared pursuant to section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act at https://investors.novozymes.com/investors/ corporate-governance/articles-of-associationand-reports-on-corporate-governance/ default.aspx. These recommendations require companies to explain any deviations.

The Board of Directors believes that the share structure with A and B common stock continues to be the best way in 2020 to safeguard Novozymes' long-term strategy and development to the benefit of the company's shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nRegarding capital structure, Novozymes will continue to favor a rather conservative balance sheet, as reflected by a target for net interestbearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. Thus the capital structure is in line with the target.\n\nNovozymes is party to a number of partnership contracts that can be terminated by the other party in the event of significant changes to the ownership or control of Novozymes. A few of these contracts contain provisions that restrict Novozymes' licenses to use specific forms of technology in such situations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board  member                     | Audit Committee   | Nomination and Remuneration  Committee   | Innovation  Committee   | Nationality   | Board meetings  attended   |   Board  tenure | Election  period   | Share  trading in  2020   | Number of  shares end  of 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| J\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen (Chair) 1,2 |                   |                                          |                         | Danish        |                            |            2011 | 1 year             | 3,500                     | 5,500                            |\n| Agnete Raaschou-Nielsen 1,2,4     |                   |                                          |                         | Danish        |                            |            2011 | 1 year             | -                         | -                                |\n| Cees de Jong 1,2,5                |                   |                                          |                         | Dutch         |                            |            2020 | 1 year             | 2,000                     | 2,000                            |\n| Heine Dalsgaard 1,5               |                   |                                          |                         | Danish        |                            |            2020 | 1 year             | 3,000                     | 3,000                            |\n| Sharon James 1, 2, 5              |                   |                                          |                         | British       |                            |            2020 | 1 year             | -                         | -                                |\n| Kasim Kutay 1                     |                   |                                          |                         | British       |                            |            2017 | 1 year             | -                         | -                                |\n| Kim Stratton 1,2                  |                   |                                          |                         | Australian    |                            |            2017 | 1 year             | -                         | -                                |\n| Mathias Uhl\u00e9n 1                   |                   |                                          |                         | Swedish       |                            |            2007 | 1 year             | -                         | 650                              |\n| Lena Bech Holskov 3               |                   |                                          |                         | Danish        |                            |            2013 | 4 years            | -                         | 1,100                            |\n| Anders Hentze Knudsen 3           |                   |                                          |                         | Danish        |                            |            2013 | 4 years            | (356)                     | -                                |\n| Lars Bo K\u00f8ppler 3                 |                   |                                          |                         | Danish        |                            |            2010 | 4 years            | -                         | 360                              |\n\n- 1.

In designing the policy, we collected external benchmarks and sought independent advice from external experts on executive remuneration in Denmark and Europe and consulted a representative group of shareholders for input. We believe the new remuneration policy ensures alignment with the best practice expectations of investors, creates a strong link between performance and remuneration and provides clarity and simplicity of the remuneration arrangements.\n\n## General remuneration policy\n\nNovozymes' remuneration policy for managers and other employees is designed to both encourage strong individual performance and support Novozymes' overall value creation. Remuneration consists of a base salary, pension contributions, a cash bonus and stockbased incentive programs. These components are linked to employees' individual performance and to the level of achievement of Novozymes' financial, social and environmental targets. The remuneration policy aims to provide managers and other employees with a competitive financial package, which we review regularly against external benchmarks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## New remuneration report\n\nIn 2020, we have prepared the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2020, which is disclosed as a separate report .  The content of the report has been prepared so as to meet the requirements of section 139b of the Danish Companies Act and holds information and details on the remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management. The Novozymes Remuneration Report 2020 will be presented for an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2021. The following is a summary of the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2020.\n\n## Remuneration of the Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not incentivebased. This ensures that the Board of Directors safeguards the company's long-term interests without taking into consideration what this may mean in terms of the value of incentivebased remuneration. The Board of Directors' fee is set at a market-conformant level that reflects the competencies and efforts required of the role, given the complexity of the Novozymes Group, the scope of the work, and the number of Board meetings held.\n\nThe fixed base fee was DKK 500,000 in 2020, the same as it has been since 2015. The Chair receives a fee that is three times the base fee and the Vice Chair a fee that is two times the base fee.\n\nFor committee work on the Audit Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the committee chair and other committee members receive a further base fee and half a base fee respectively. However, the Chair and the Vice Chair of the Board do not receive such additional fee if appointed to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn August 2020, the Board of Directors decided to establish an Innovation Committee. The Board of Directors determined that the Chair of the Innovation Committee would receive a further base fee (for 2020 pro rata adjusted to the relevant part of the year) and that members of the Innovation Committee would each receive half a base fee (similarly adjusted).\n\nDuring 2019, Patricia Malarkey and Lars Green resigned from the Board, and at the Annual General Meeting held in February 2020, Agnete Raaschou-Nielsen, resigned from the Board\n\n## Overview of Committee members\n\n|         | Audit Committee                    | Nomination and  Remuneration Commitee   | Innovation Committee       |\n|---------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Chair   | Heine Dalsgaard                    | J\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen                   | Sharon James               |\n| Members | J\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen Cees de Jong | Cees de Jong Kasim Kutay Kim Stratton   | Kim Stratton Mathias Uhl\u00e9n |\n\nas well. Cees de Jong, Sharon James and Heine Dalsgaard were elected as new board members. Cees de Jong was appointed Vice Chair.\n\nThe number of board members was thereby reestablished at seven member elected at the Annual General Meeting which, together with the newly established Innovation Committee, resulted in an increase of the total fees paid to the Board of Directors from DKK 7.0 million in 2019 to DKK 8.2 million in 2020.\n\nThe individual board members' fees and their shareholdings can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2020.\n\n## Remuneration of the Executive Management\n\nAs per 31 December 2020, the Executive Management of Novozymes A/S consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Ester Baiget, President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n- \u00b7 Lars Green, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n- \u00b7 Thomas Videb\u00e6k, Executive Vice President\n\nEster Baiget replaced Peder Holk Nielsen as CEO on February 1, 2020.\n\nThomas Videb\u00e6k will transition his roles as Executive Vice President of People, Sustainability & Brand and Strategy & Business Transformation during the second quarter of 2021, after which he will leave Novozymes. We are immensely grateful for Thomas' contributions to Novozymes during his many years with the company.\n\nThe total remuneration to members of Executive Management comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 A base salary plus pension, company car and certain other benefits\n- \u00b7 A short-term incentive program (cash bonus) - STIP\n- \u00b7 A long-term incentive program (stock-based program) - LTIP\n\nIn 2020, the members of the Executive Management received a 2.3% increase in their base salary. The increase was only given to executives with an employment start date prior to January 1, 2020.\n\nEster Baiget and Lars Green will in addition to their ordinary remuneration receive compensation for lost incentives from their previous employers. The compensation is",

        "page_content": "subject to certain conditions. Over the period 2020-2023, Ester Baiget may receive up to a total of DKK 9.6 million in extraordinary signon compensation for lost incentives from her previous employer, of which DKK 4.2 million was paid out in 2020.  Over the period 20202023, Lars Green may receive up to a total of DKK 14.5 million in extraordinary sign-on compensation for lost incentives from his previous employer, of which DKK 0.7 million was paid out in 2020.\n\nThomas Videb\u00e6k will leave Novozymes during 2021. His severance package, totaling DKK 35 million, was fully expensed in 2020. The severance package consists of salary, pension and bonuses during the notice period (12 months) as well as termination compensation\n\n(24 months) and compensation for not being part of a stock-based program in 2020 and 2021. Severance pay of DKK 9 million was paid out in 2020, while the remaining DKK 26 million will be paid out in 2021. Furthermore, the remaining value of awarded stock and stock options, DKK 2 million, has been expensed.\n\nPeder Holk Nielsen left Novozymes on January 31, 2020. The severance payment of DKK 32 million was made in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, executives were eligible for a defined contribution pension scheme of 11% of their base salary. In 2019, the pension scheme was between 25% and 27.6% of the base salary and short-term cash-based incentive.\n\nThe targets for the short-term incentive program (STIP) are set by the Board of Directors in connection with the review of the business plan for the year. Good performance will result in target payout (65%) while maximum payout is only achieved for delivering an extraordinary performance. Maximum payout equals 9.5 months' salary.\n\nIn 2020 the targets for the STIP were split on the financial performance of the company at 60% weight (EBIT 45% weight and cash flow 15% weight) and targets for the individual executives at 40% weight.\n\nIn 2020 the financial performance of Novozymes resulted in the EBIT target being met, while the cash flow target was exceeded.\n\nThe payout related to these targets was 65% and 100%, respectively.\n\nThe level of achievement of individual performance targets and thus the size of remuneration payment to the individual executive is determined by the Board of Directors based on recommendations from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nBased on its assessment, the Board determined that the pay-out based on individual targets would be 90% for Ester Baiget, 80% for Lars Green and 67% for Thomas Videb\u00e6k.\n\nThe total payout ratio on the STIP 2020 is shown on the next page.\n\n## Remuneration paid to individual members of the Executive Management\n\n|                                          | Fixed   | Fixed                       | Fixed           | Variable           | Variable                   | Variable                 |                                   |                    |                          |                     |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| DKK million                              | Salary  | Contribution  based pension | Other  benefits | Cash bonus  (STIP) | Incentive  programs (LTIP) | 2020 Total  Remuneration | Compensation  for lost incentives | Severance  Package | 2019 Total  Remuneration | Severance  Package* |\n| Ester Baiget (from 1/2-2020)             | 6.9     | 0.8                         | 0.2             | 4.4                | 7.1                        | 19.4                     | 4.2                               | -                  | -                        | -                   |\n| Lars Green                               | 5.9     | 0.6                         | 0.2             | 3.6                | 5.9                        | 16.2                     | 0.7                               | -                  | 5.5                      | -                   |\n| Thomas Videb\u00e6k                           | 6.8     | 0.7                         | 0.2             | 3.9                | -                          | 11.6                     | -                                 | 35.2               | 13.4                     | -                   |\n| Former executives                        |         |                             |                 |                    |                            |                          |                                   |                    |                          |                     |\n| Peder Holk Nielsen (to 31/1-2020)        | 0.7     | 0.2                         | -               | -                  | -                          | 0.9                      | -                                 | -                  | 19.1                     | 31.9                |\n| Prisca Havranec-Kosicek   (to 30/8-2019) | -       | -                           | -               | -                  | -                          | -                        | -                                 | -                  | 4.7                      | 16.2                |\n|                                          | 20.3    | 2.3                         | 0.6             | 11.9               | 13.0                       | 48.1                     | 4.9                               | 35.2               | 42.7                     | 48.1                |\n\nThe difference in the total remuneration to the Executive Management in the above table compared to note 6.1 - Management Remuneration is related to long-term incentives.

        "page_content": "The targets for the long-term incentive program covering the period 2017-2019 were partly met, and 61% of the program was awarded in January 2020. As a result, 38,857 shares associated with the program were released to the Executive Management in January 2020.\n\nGoing forward, the Board of Directors will issue annual long-term incentive program (LTIP) grants with overlapping three-year performance periods. This allows the Board of Directors to re-assess targets for each annual grant cycle to ensure they are both sufficiently demanding and aligned with the strategy.\n\nIn 2020, the new LTIP for the Executive Management began covering the performance period 2020-2022. The LTIP consists of 50% shares and 50% share options. Relative to the previous long-term incentive program (20172019), the new LTIP reflects an increased weight on organic sales growth (weight of 40% of LTIP), a lower but still prominent weight on economic profit generation (weight of 40% of LTIP), and an explicit weight on sustainability (weight of 20% of LTIP). The targets are aligned\n\nwith the updated strategy and the measures of business success for the period 2020-2022.\n\nThe stock was allocated in March 2020 and will be released in the beginning of 2023 in accordance with the level of target achievement, while the stock option program is a three-year incentive program with annual allocations. In 2020, 135,280 stock options were granted to the Executive Management. The allocations for 2020-2023 will be adjusted in the beginning of 2023 in relation to the level of target achievement.\n\nThe annual LTIP cannot exceed 19 months' base salary. Further, the program includes a maximum-value clause allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nThe members of the Executive Management have contracts of employment containing standard conditions for executive officers of Danish listed companies, including the periods of notice that both parties are required to give\n\nand noncompetition clauses. If an executive officer's contract of employment is terminated by the company without any misconduct on the part of the executive officer, the executive officer has a notice period of 12 months. In addition to the notice period, the executive officer has a right to termination compensation of 12 months' base salary and pension contributions. However, as Thomas Videb\u00e6k was appointed before 2016 he was entitled to termination compensation of two years' base salary and pension contributions.\n\n## Remuneration of senior leadership\n\nThe remuneration of Novozymes' senior leadership (195 vice presidents and directors) is consistent with the general remuneration policy. Incentive programs for vice presidents and directors have been established for the 20202022 period. The programs follow the same mechanisms as the program for the Executive Management. Further information on the incentive programs for these employee groups can be found in Note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements, which also includes an overview of outstanding stock options.\n\n## Short-term incentive program - Target achivement\n\n| Weight   | Target             | % /  (index)                                           | Ester Baiget   |            | Lars Green   | Thomas Videb\u00e6k   |\n|----------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|------------------|\n| 45%      | EBIT               | % of maximum / (index compared to  target performance) | 65   (100)     |            | 65   (100)   | 65   (100)       |\n| 15%      | Cash flow          | % of maximum / (index compared to  target performance) | 100   (154)    | 100        | (154)        | 100   (154)      |\n| 40%      | Individual targets |                                                        |                | 90   (138) | 80   (123)   | 67   (103)       |",

        "page_content": "## Sales and earnings\n\n## Sales\n\nTotal sales in 2020 were DKK 14,012 million, flat organically and a decline of 3% in DKK compared with 2019.\n\n## 'Resilient 2020 performance despite the COVID-19 pandemic.'\n\nThe overall effect from COVID-19 on Novozymes' sales performance was negative, however, with a dampened effect as a result of diversified end-market exposure. Solutions for Household Care benefitted from an increased demand for cleaning solutions, whereas solutions for Bioenergy and Textile production declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic induced drop in gasoline consumption, especially in the US, and lower demand and production of textiles.\n\n## Sales and sales growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross profit and margin\n\nGross profit decreased by 1% to DKK 7,853 million from DKK 7,954 million in 2019, driven by lower sales. The gross margin was 56.0%, up from 55.3% in 2019. The increase was mainly due to lower input costs, improved production efficiency and a one-off settlement related to the former BioAg setup that was partly offset by adverse currency developments.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nOperating costs decreased by 4% to DKK 4,257 million. Operating costs as a percentage of sales were 30%.\n\n- \u00b7 Sales and distribution costs decreased by 3%, accounting for 11.3% of sales\n- \u00b7 Research and development costs decreased by 1%, accounting for 13.8% of sales\n- \u00b7 Administrative costs decreased by 12%, accounting for 5.3% of sales\n\nOperating costs were negatively impacted by reorganization costs, acquisition-related transaction costs and an impairment loss, and positively impacted by savings on employee and travel costs.\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income was DKK 56 million, compared with DKK 520 million in 2019. Other operating income in 2020 was positively impacted by DKK 42 million from the contingent income related to the divestment of the pharma-related royalty. 2019 was impacted by the termination of The BioAg Alliance and the divestment of the pharma-related royalty.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nEBITDA decreased by 7% to DKK 4,918 million, down from DKK 5,292 million in 2019. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses were DKK 1,266 million in 2020, up 1% from DKK 1,253 million in 2019.\n\n## EBIT and EBIT margin\n\nEBIT decreased by 10% to DKK 3,652 million, down from DKK 4,039 million in 2019. The EBIT margin ended at 26.1%, down from 28.1% in 2019. Excluding the one-off settlement related to the former BioAG setup, reorganization costs, acquisition-related transaction costs and an impairment loss, the underlying EBIT margin was ~27%  in 2020, which was ~1 percentage point higher than the underlying EBIT margin of ~26% in 2019.\n\n## EBIT and EBIT margin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\nEBIT\n\n- \u00b7 EBIT margin (%)\n\n## Net finance\n\nNet financial costs were DKK 127 million in 2020, compared with DKK 235 million in 2019. In 2020, Novozymes realized a DKK 35 million currency hedging/revaluation net loss, compared with a net loss of DKK 205 million in 2019.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe effective tax rate was 19.7%, up from 17.0% in 2019. In 2019, Novozymes had a positive impact from reduced uncertain tax positions related to bilateral advance pricing agreements.\n\n## Earnings per share (diluted)\n\nEarnings per share (diluted) were DKK 10.02, compared with DKK 11.01 in 2019.",

The improvement in operating cash flow was mainly due to higher cash conversion from better earnings quality, a settlement related to the former BioAg setup and positive changes and timing effects in working capital. The change in net working capital was caused by lower receivables and lower inventories, partly offset by lower other liabilities.\n\n## Cash flow from operating activities\n\n* The comparatives for 2016-2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net investments\n\nNet investments excluding acquisitions were DKK 936 million, down from DKK 991 million in 2019.

The negative cash flow from financing activities was mainly due to the 2020 stock buyback program (DKK 1,500 million) and dividend payments (DKK 1,483 million).\n\n## Free cash flow before acquisitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cash position\n\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, amounted to DKK 1,181 million, up from DKK 711 million at December 31, 2019.

The increase was mainly driven by net investments and the acquisition of PrecisionBiotics Group, partly offset by depreciations and amortizations, changes in currency and a decrease in net working capital.\n\n## Invested capital\n\nInvested capital decreased from DKK 15,507 million in 2019 to DKK 15,094 million in 2020. This was mainly a result of a decrease in net woking capital.\n\n## ROIC and average invested capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ROIC\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC), including goodwill, was 18.9%, down 2.2 percentage points from 21.1% in 2019. The decrease was mainly driven by lower net profit and higher average invested capital.\n\n## Net working capital\n\nNovozymes' net working capital decreased to DKK 2,901 million, down from DKK 3,478 million in 2019, due to lower trade receivables, lower inventories, partly offset by lower other payables.\n\n## Net working capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt\n\nNovozymes had net interest-bearing debt of DKK 3,871 million at December 31, 2020, compared with DKK 4,049 million at December 31, 2019. Net interest-bearing debt was impacted by cash outflows from dividend payments of DKK 1,483 million, stock buybacks of DKK 1,500 million and the acquisition of PrecisionBiotics Group, which was more than offset by cash inflows from operating activities.\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) and net interest- bearing debt- to- EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\nNIBD\n\n\u00b7\n\nNIBD/EBITDA\n\n## Net interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA\n\nNet interest-bearing debt-to-EBITDA was 0.8x at December 31, 2020, on par with December 31, 2019.",

The decrease was a result of lower net profit.\n\n## Treasury stock\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the holding of treasury stock was 5.7 million B shares, equivalent to 2.0% of the common stock.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Shareholders' Meeting approve a dividend of DKK 5.25 per share for the 2020 financial year, same as in 2019. This will result in an expected total dividend payment of approximately DKK 1,466 million, corresponding to a payout ratio of 51.9%.\n\n## Payout ratio and dividend growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stock buyback program\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes bought back 4.3 million B shares at an aggregate transaction value of DKK 1,500 million under the stock buyback program initiated on February 10, 2020, and completed on August 24, 2020.

The main contributor is renewable electricity which has gone up from 49% in 2019 to 69% in 2020, as our production site in Franklinton, USA have started procuring renewable electricity in 2020. In addition, all electricity in Denmark, Brazil and Tianjin, China come from renewable sources e.g. offshore windfarms and hydropower.\n\nEnergy by source 2020 (2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Electricity - conventional 18% (29%)\n\n\u00b7\n\nElectricity - renewable\n\n39%\n\n(29%)\n\n\u00b7\n\nSteam\n\n22%\n\n(21%)\n\n\u00b7\n\nFuels - conventional\n\n15%\n\n(15%)\n\n- \u00b7 Heat - conventional 2% (4%)\n- \u00b7 Fuel and heat - renewable 4% (2%)\n\n## Water\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes' water consumption increased by 2% from 7,845,000 m 3 in 2019 to 7,998,000 m 3 . The increase is partly driven by extra cleaning at all sites due to product mix changes and a higher cleaning requirement related to food safety.\n\nThe total volume of wastewater generated in 2020 increased by 5%.\n\n## Waste\n\nIn 2020, 97% of our biomass volume was handled in a circular set-up (recycled), on par with 2019.\n\nFor solid waste, the rate of recycling across our global production sites decreased to 48%, compared with 52% in 2019.\n\n## Environmental compliance\n\nThe number of breaches of regulatory limits recorded worldwide increased to 20 in 2020 from 17 in 2019. Most of these breaches were related to wastewater treatment. Novozymes is addressing these incidents. In addition, we received ten neighbor complaints in 2020, compared with seven in 2019, mostly related to air pollution and waste management.",

At December 31, 2020, 33% of senior management (directors and higher) were women, up from 31% in 2019.\n\n## Occupational health & safety\n\nThe frequency of occupational injuries increased to 1.3 per million working hours in 2020, compared with 0.9 per million working hours in 2019. The three-year rolling average is within the 2022 target of a frequency of 1.5 per million working or less.\n\n## Frequency of accidents (per million working hours)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Innovation\n\nNovozymes is committed to delivering bioinnovation and launched 12 new products in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes had 963 active patent families, which comprise the number of inventions that have active patent applications or active patents. The number of active patent families has increased from 951 in 2019.\n\n## Business ethics\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes reinforced our commitment to business integrity. During the year 99% of Novozymes' employees in scope completed business integrity training, on par with 2019.\n\nAs in 2019, there were no breaches of competition law in 2020.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes contributed to local communities responding to local challenges. In China, for example, we donated RMB 1 million to Red Cross to build hospitals and in Latin America we provided 100 PCs with internet access to unprivileged students.\n\n## Customer engagement\n\nNovozymes conducts an annual customer satisfaction survey and tracks progress on its Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is assessed on a scale from -100 to +100. In 2020, we received an NPS of +50, which confirms our solid relationships with our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have affected customers perceptions of Novozymes in 2020 compared to previous years.",

PrecisionBiotics Group holds a leading position within probiotics for human gut health and is well positioned with several clinically-backed products already on the market.\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Novozymes acquired Microbiome Labs adding a broad range of proprietary microbiome solutions to its human health activities and securing an attractive entry point into the North American probiotics market.\n\nBoth acquisitions are related to human health and are key steps in building the OneHealth brand, which also comprises the 2016 acquisition of Organobalance GmbH along with research and development activities based on Novozymes' existing technology.\n\nReference is made to Note 3.5 for a description of the two acquisitions and their impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNovozymes A/S\n\n## New organization\n\nOn February 1, 2020, Ester Baiget was appointed new President and CEO of Novozymes.\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Novozymes announced a new organizational structure directing the organization to a more value-chain focused and customer-centric approach to support and deliver on our Better business with biology strategy. This new structure allows for a stronger differentiation between sustainable solutions with clear consumer benefits, and sustainable solutions focusing on maximizing yields and optimizing processes for our customers.\n\nAs a part of the new organizational structure, changes were made to the Executive Leadership Team; see Note 6.1. The sales reporting has been updated to reflect the new organization; see Note 2.2.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNovozymes delivered a resilient 2020 performance despite the COVID-19 pandemic. See the section on sales and earnings for more details on COVID-19 impacts on 2020 sales.\n\nNovozymes has only made use of unavoidable financial governmental relief packages, resulting in an negligible impact. All major postponed tax payments etc. were settled before the end of the year. The COVID-19 pandemic was not a triggering event for impairments in 2020.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a challenge for occupational health and safety in 2020. Task force teams were in place, focused on keeping employees safe and labs and production running; see Note 8.2 for more details.\n\nThroughout the year, Novozymes maintained close communications with customers on measures taken within the organization to prevent impact on production and delivery. Novozymes also focused on exercising its responsibility as a corporate citizen to support authorities in mitigating the effects of the pandemic. Reference is made to Note 8.4 and Note 8.5.\n\n66",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 Basis of reporting\n\nThis section provides an overview of Novozymes' principal accounting policies, the critical accounting estimates and judgments applied, a definition of materiality as well as the impact of new or amended IFRS standards and interpretations.\n\nThe symbols I/S , B/S and ESG show which amounts in the notes can be found in the income statement, the balance sheet, and in environmental data and social and governance data respectively.\n\nThe accounting policies described below apply to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and judgments are described in the notes to which they relate to enhance understanding. The descriptions of accounting policies in the notes form part of the overall description of accounting policies.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Novozymes A/S (the Parent Company) and subsidiaries controlled by Novozymes A/S, prepared in accordance with Group accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining items of a uniform nature and subsequently eliminating intercompany transactions, internal stockholdings and balances, and unrealized intercompany profits and losses.\n\nConsolidation of the environmental, social and governance data follows the same principles as the financial reporting.\n\n## Translation of foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK).\n\nExchange rate differences arising between the exchange rate at the transaction date and the reporting date are recognized as Financial income or Financial costs.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency defined for each company using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nFinancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into DKK at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date for assets and liabilities, and at average exchange rates for income statement items.\n\nThe following exchange rate differences, arising from translation using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, are recognized in Other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7 Translation of foreign subsidiaries' net assets at the beginning of the year\n- \u00b7 Translation of foreign subsidiaries' income statements from average exchange rates\n\n## Non-IFRS financial measures\n\nNovozymes uses certain financial measures that are not defined in IFRS to describe the Group's financial performance, financial position and cash flows. These financial measures may therefore be defined and calculated differently from similar measures in other companies, and may thus not be comparable.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures presented in the annual report are:\n\n- \u00b7 Organic sales growth\n- \u00b7 Operating costs\n- \u00b7 Economic profit\n- \u00b7 ROIC\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow before acquisitions\n\nDefinitions of non-IFRS financial measures are provided in the Glossary.\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nFrom 2020, Novozymes is required to file the annual report in the new European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') and the Annual report in 2020 is therefore prepared in the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements in the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement\n\nline item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n\nThe annual report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named NOVOZYMES-2020-12-31.zip.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the environmental, social and governance data requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or if more detailed information becomes available. Such changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate in question is revised.",

Management judgment is required in particular when assessing the substance of transactions that have a complicated structure or legal form.\n\nThe critical accounting estimates and judgments could potentially have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis of reporting\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act. The fiscal year for the Group is January 1 - December 31.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, with the exception of derivatives and securities, which are measured at fair value. The accounting policies are unchanged from last year.\n\nThe consolidated environmental, social and governance data have been prepared in accordance with principles that adhere to internationally recognized voluntary reporting standards and principles such as the UN Global Compact (UNGC). Novozymes is a signatory to the UNGC, a voluntary policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. We also take inspiration from the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework for climate-related disclosures.\n\nOur reporting and materiality assessments have also been inspired by the GRI framework.\n\nThe principles are unchanged from last year.\n\n## Defining materiality\n\nNovozymes' annual report is based on the concept of materiality, to ensure that the content is material and relevant.\n\nIf items are individually immaterial, they are aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the statements or in the notes. Novozymes provides the specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is considered immaterial to the economic decision-making of the readers of the annual report.\n\nThe disclosures on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues include information on our management approach, targets, initiatives and related progress.\n\nVarious global movements and the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased focus on how companies manage ESG issues, specifically on social issues for eg. occupational health & safety and labor practices. As a responsible corporate citizen, Novozymes considers these issues to be highly material, and we continuously strive to strengthen our governance and management of these issues.\n\nNovozymes' materiality assessment is a systematic and rigorous process that integrates input from external stakeholders, trend analyses and internal engagement with relevant departments including Investor Relations, Risk Management & Controls, Quality and Sustainability and leadership from our commercial divisions. This process results in a materiality matrix of financial and ESG issues and reflects the importance of those issues to our key stakeholders versus their impact on Novozymes. We use our materiality matrix to guide our strategy and reporting. During our assessment in 2020, no new issues were added to or deleted from our matrix. For more information, refer to www.novozymes. com/en/about-us/sustainability/materiality.\n\nIn the following table, we highlight some of the material issues, for which, we have external targets/flagship initiatives and make a contribution to relevant SDG(s).",

Sites with activities considered not to have a significant environmental impact are not included. Such sites comprise sales offices, R&D labs, and sites with limited blending and storage of products. However, measures are taken to ensure that at least 97% of the total Novozymes quantity of the measured environmental parameter is included in the reported numbers.\n\n## Impact of new accounting standards\n\nNovozymes has adopted the following new or amended standards and interpretations from January 1, 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations, clarifies the definition of a business.\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material, clarifies the definition of material.\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR), which modify specific hedge accounting requirements to provide relief from potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the IBOR reform, and requires additional information to be provided about hedging relationships which are directly affected by these uncertainties.\n\nThe adoption of the new and amended standards and interpretations has not had a significant impact on recognition, measurement or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for 2020 and is not anticipated to have a significant impact on future periods.\n\n## New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nIASB has issued new or amended accounting standards and interpretations that have not yet become effective and have consequently not been implemented in the consolidated financial statements for 2020. Novozymes expects to adopt the accounting standards and interpretations when they become mandatory. None of the new or amended standards or interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.",

Revenue includes the sale of goods and related services and royalties, and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Novozymes expects to be entitled. Revenue from the straightforward sale of goods to customers is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, i.e. when goods are delivered. Variable considerations are included in revenue to the extent that they are not subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nThe performance obligations in the contracts are to deliver enzymes and microorganisms to customers, and each batch delivered is considered a separate performance obligation, as each batch is distinct.\n\n## Discounts\n\nEnzymes and microorganisms are sometimes sold at a rebate. A rebate agreement can be set up in various ways, but common to all agreements is that revenue is recognized\n\nbased on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated rebate. The rebates are estimated based on experience, as well as information related to expected orders 3-12 months in advance. The estimated rebates are reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Returns\n\nA few of Novozymes' partnerships are granted a right of return. No revenue is recognized for the goods expected to be returned, as a refund liability is recognized. Estimates of the expected level of returns are based on analysis of historical returns and knowledge of the relevant markets/ products. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period. As the goods returned are usually scrapped, no inventory asset is recognized.\n\n## Profit split\n\nNovozymes has entered into partnerships where Novozymes manufactures and sells products to a partner, who undertakes the sales to end customers. The profit on products sold to end customers is shared\n\nbetween the partner and Novozymes based on predetermined profit-sharing mechanisms.\n\nRevenue from these arrangements consists of sales of products to the partner and the shared profit, and is recognized in full when the goods are delivered to the other contracting party. This is done by calculating the expected profit based on insights, experience and other input factors. The calculated profit is recognized as a contract asset or contract liability until an invoice is issued. The realized profit is settled periodically.\n\n## Commission\n\nNovozymes has entered into commission agreements where agents undertake sales to third parties in return for a commission on realized sales. Revenue from such agreements is recognized when the goods are delivered, as the nature of the performance obligation is to provide the specified goods.\n\n## Other\n\nRevenue collected on behalf of third parties is not recognized as revenue.\n\nNovozymes' obligation to provide a refund for products that are not of the agreed quality or according to agreed specifications under the standard warranty terms is recognized as contract liabilities.\n\nA trade receivable is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods and an invoice is issued, as this is the point in time when the consideration becomes unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment is due. Typical payment terms are around 60 days.\n\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments, deferred revenue and liabilities for refund goods. The contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations under the contracts are fulfilled.",

        "page_content": "## 2.6 Tax\n\n## Tax risks\n\nNovozymes operates in many markets via sales companies and distributors, while production is located in a few countries. This leads to transactions between group companies. Novozymes follows the OECD principles in setting internal transfer prices for these transactions. This is a complicated area and entails a tax risk, because the transactions are subject to judgment in each country. The tax controversy risk for Novozymes is significantly reduced through the use of bilateral advance pricing agreements (APAs).\n\n## Bilateral APAs\n\nAs stated in our tax policy, Novozymes proactively engages in bilateral APAs negotiated at competent authority level to increase predictability and to mitigate transfer pricing risks. Most of the intercompany transaction value within the Novozymes Group is covered by bilateral APAs.\n\nAn APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and a tax authority determining the transfer pricing methodology for pricing the taxpayer's international transactions for future years.\n\nThe methodology is applied for a certain period based on the fulfilment of certain terms and conditions (called critical assumptions). An APA can be unilateral or bilateral. Novozymes only enters into bilateral APAs, meaning that they are negotiated between the competent tax authorities of the two countries involved in the transaction. An APA provides assurance with respect to the tax outcome of our international transactions, by agreeing in advance the arm's length pricing and pricing methodology to be applied to the international transactions.\n\nNovozymes has entered into bilateral APAs with the tax authorities in the countries\n\n## Tax in the income statement\n\n| DKK million                                     |     | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----|---------|---------|\n| Tax payable on net profit                       |     | (817)   | (894)   |\n| Change in deferred tax                          |     | 144     | 262     |\n| Prior-year adjustments - current tax            |     | 98      | 21      |\n| Prior-year adjustments - deferred tax           |     | (120)   | (33)    |\n| Tax in the income statement                     | I/S | (695)   | (644)   |\n| Calculation of effective tax rate:              |     |         |         |\n| Corporate tax rate in Denmark                   |     | (22.0)% | (22.0)% |\n| Non-taxable income less non-deductible expenses |     | 0.2%    | 0.6%    |\n| Difference in foreign tax rates                 |     | 2.5%    | 2.6%    |\n| Other adjustments                               |     | (0.4)%  | 1.8%    |\n| Effective tax rate                              |     | (19.7)% | (17.0)% |\n\nwhere internal transactions are most significant. Among APA covered transactions are group internal transactions between Denmark and the US, China and India, respectively.\n\n## Joint taxation\n\nNovozymes A/S and its Danish subsidiaries are jointly taxed with the Danish companies of the Novo Holdings A/S Group. Joint taxation also covers withholding taxes in the form of dividend tax, royalty tax and interest tax. The Danish companies are jointly and individually liable for the joint taxation liability. Any subsequent adjustments to income taxes and withholding taxes may increase the liability. Tax for the individual companies is allocated in full on the basis of the expected taxable income.\n\n## Tax in the income statement\n\nTransfer of intellectual property from Switzerland to Denmark had a positive impact on the effective tax rate of 2.9% in 2020 (2019: 2.9%). This is recognized in Difference in foreign tax rates.\n\nIn 2019, Novozymes had a positive impact from uncertain tax positions related to APAs, recognized in Other adjustments.",

Uncertain tax positions are assessed individually and recognized if it is probable that an amount will be paid or received. Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method and comprises all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. No deferred tax is recognized for goodwill, unless amortization of goodwill for tax purposes is allowed. The tax value of tax loss carry-forwards is included in the calculation of deferred tax to the extent that the tax losses can be expected to be utilized in the future.\n\nDeferred tax is measured according to current tax rules and at the tax rate expected to be in force on elimination of temporary differences. Changes in deferred tax due to tax rate changes are recognized in the income statement, unless they relate to items recognized either in Other comprehensive income or directly in Shareholders' equity.",

The impaired asset was part of a project that has been terminated, and the asset has been fully written off.\n\n## Impairment test of goodwill\n\nNovozymes has one cash-generating unit (CGU). Since 2016, Management had identified two CGUs: Novozymes' main activities and the Biopharma CGU. With the divestment of\n\nthe pharma-related royalty, and thereby the remaining activity within the Biopharma CGU in April 2019, only one CGU remained.\n\nAs the market value of Novozymes is significantly higher than its equity, no further key assumptions are used to determine whether impairment of goodwill exists (2019: no impairment).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\n\nManagement assesses the risk of impairment of the Group's intangible assets. This requires judgment in relation to the identification of cash-generating units (CGUs) and the underlying assumptions in the Group's impairment model.\n\nIf there is any indication of impairment, value in use is estimated and compared with the carrying amount. The calculation of value in use is based on the discounted cash flow method using estimates of future cash flows from the continuing use. The key parameters are the expected revenue streams and the rate used to discount the cash flows.\n\nAs a consequence of the termination of The BioAg Alliance in 2019, intellectual property from The BioAg Alliance was recognized at fair value. Measuring the fair value of these assets required Management's assessment of business plans for the individual assets. The key parameters were expected cash flows and the WACC used to discount the cash flows.",

These assets have been recognized at fair value amounting to DKK 95 million and the corresponding income is recognized in Other operating income.\n\nThe goodwill disposal is related to the divestment of the pharma-related royalty.\n\n## Impairment\n\nIn 2019, impairment losses of DKK 71 million were recognized on two specific assets. As these are related to the termination of The BioAg Alliance, the impairment losses are recognized and included in Other operating income.\n\nThe impairment losses were the result of impairment tests performed on assets where the termination of The BioAg Alliance has resulted in reduced sales projections for the\n\nassets in question. The cash flow used to test one of the assets for impairment was based on business plans for the period 2019-2025, and the terminal value used was based on the expected lifetime and cash flow over that period. For the other impaired asset, the cash flow ceased in 2019 with the termination of The BioAg Alliance.\n\nA pre-tax WACC of 7% was used to calculate the discounted cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill and IT development projects in progress are not subject to amortization.\n\nCosts associated with large IT projects for the development of software for internal use are capitalized if incurred with a view to developing new and improved systems.\n\nAmortization is based on the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the finite-lived assets, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Completed IT development projects are amortized over their useful lives. IT development assets are amortized over a period of 3-5 years\n- \u00b7 Acquired patents, trademarks, licenses and know-how are amortized over their useful lives. The useful lives of patents and trademarks are normally identical to the patent period. Licenses are amortized over the agreement period. Recognized patents, trademarks, licenses and knowhow are amortized over a period of 7-15 years\n\nExpected useful lives are reassessed regularly.\n\nThe Group regularly reviews the carrying amounts of its finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether there is an indication of an impairment loss. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the asset's carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent of changes in the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment calculation.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.",

Refer to Note 3.3 for additional disclosures relating to leases.\n\nDepreciation relating to leases in 2019 amounted to DKK 124 million.\n\n## Impairment\n\nAn ongoing production-related construction project was abandoned in 2019. This led to an expense of DKK 33 million, which was recognized in Cost of goods sold.\n\nBuildings expected to be sold within 12 months were written down to the expected selling price less transaction costs before being transferred\n\nto Assets held for sale. Buildings amounting to DKK 62 million were transferred to Assets held for sale. An impairment loss of DKK 15 million was recognized in Sales and distribution costs and Administrative costs at DKK 4 million and DKK 11 million respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Borrowing costs in respect of construction of major assets are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation is based on the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings: 12-50 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and machinery: 5-25 years\n- \u00b7 Other equipment: 3-18 years\n\nThe residual values and useful lives of the assets are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if necessary at each reporting date.\n\nThe Group regularly reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication of impairment in those assets. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be lower than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent of changes in the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment calculation.",

If, at inception, it is assessed that a contract contains a lease, a lease asset is recognized. Lease assets are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, plus the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset. Payments include fixed payments, variable lease payments depending on an index or a rate and the exercise price of purchase options that are reasonably certain to be excercised.\n\nThe lease assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. The lease assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.\n\nLease assets are depreciated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings: 1-12 years\n- \u00b7 Land: 10-90 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and machinery: 1-10 years\n- \u00b7 Equipment and company cars: 1-10 years\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low value are recognized as expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNovozymes' portfolio of leases covers leases of land, buildings and other equipment such\n\nas cars and transportation containers.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially recognized at the present value of future lease payments including payments from extension or purchase options that are considered reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured using the implicit borrowing rate in the contracts or, where this is not available, the marginal borrowing rate in the countries in which Novozymes operates. Novozymes applies a single discount rate to portfolios of leases in the countries in which Novozymes operates based on contract currency and loan periods.\n\nIf a lease contract is modified, the lease liability is remeasured. For building leases, lease terms are estimated taking the size of the building and its strategic importance into consideration. Novozymes has entered into several open-ended building leases and building leases with extension options. Lease terms of such agreements are estimated based on the strategic importance of the buildings and the estimated time frame necessary to vacate the premises. The estimated lease term is reassessed at each reporting date. The estimated lease terms for such contracts do not exceed 12 years.",

Novozymes aims for its production sites not to have a negative environmental impact. These liabilities relate to established circumstances, and the costs are expected to be incurred either when concrete measures are implemented or when a site is vacated. The expected costs and timing are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Legal and other obligations\n\nNovozymes is involved in a number of ongoing legal disputes, and provisions are made for the estimated costs of these based on a current evaluation of the outcomes. The ongoing cases are expected to be finalized in 2021-2022. In Management's opinion, the outcomes of these cases are not expected to give rise to any significant losses beyond the amounts provided for at December 31, 2020.\n\nIn 2019, Novozymes settled a long-standing patent dispute, and as a result Novozymes paid DKK 65 million to the counterpart, of which DKK 31 million was provided for in previous years.\n\nOther obligations include other long-term employee benefits and other contractual obligations.\n\nOther obligations mainly relates to the divestment of the pharma-related royalty, for which part of the selling price received must be repaid if certain patent registrations are not obtained by 2021. A number of registrations were obtained in 2020. The amount potentially to be repaid has been reduced by DKK 42 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nProvisions are recognized where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that it will lead to an outflow of financial resources. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected expenditure required to settle the obligation.\n\nOther long-term employee benefits account for only a minor amount, as the majority of Novozymes' pension plans are defined contribution plans, covering approximately 99% of employees. These obligations are mainly expected to be incurred over a relatively long period of time.\n\nIn 2019, DKK 40 million in other obligations was utilized as a consequence of the termination of The BioAg Alliance.",

The consideration transferred includes the fair value at the acquisition date of any contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nfor human health. The goodwill is not tax deductible.\n\nThe purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration of up to DKK 298 million. The consideration is contingent on the achievement of sales and EBITDA estimates for 2023 and is recognized at the anticipated fair value of DKK 146 million at the acquisition date. Fair value is assessed by using the earn-out from the most probable sales and EBITDA estimates in 2023 discounted at a 7% discount rate.\n\nNet revenue and profit contributed from PrecisionBiotics Group to the consolidated income statement are immaterial for the reporting period. This would also have been the case if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2020.\n\nThe transaction costs amounted to DKK 20 million and are included in Sales and distribution costs.\n\nGoodwill may subsequently be adjusted for changes in the fair value of the consideration transferred and/or changes in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired until 12 months after the acquisition date, to the extent such changes relate to facts and circumstances present at the acquisition date. Acquired companies are consolidated from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.",

The goodwill is tax deductible.\n\nThe purchase agreement includes a contingent consideration of up to DKK 825 million. The consideration is contingent on the achievement of sales targets for 2022 and is recognized at the anticipated fair value of DKK 338 million at the acquisition date. Fair value is assessed by using the earn-out from the most probable sales estimates in 2022 discounted at a discount rate of 8 %.\n\nRevenue and profit contributed from Microbiome Labs are not included in the consolidated income statement for 2020. On a pro forma basis, if the acquisition had been effective from January 1, 2020 Microbiome Labs would have contributed DKK ~250 million to revenue and an EBIT margin slightly lower than Novozymes' EBIT margin.\n\nTransaction costs incurred in 2020 amounted to DKK 29 million and are included in Sales and distribution costs.\n\nmake estimates and use assumptions, as observable market prices are not available.

        "page_content": "## 5.1 Financial risk factors and risk management\n\nDue to the international nature of Novozymes' operations, our earnings and financial position are exposed to a number of financial risk factors. Financial risks are managed centrally for the entire Group. The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Directors, and sets the limits for the various financial risks and the derivatives used to hedge risk. The Treasury Policy is adjusted on an ongoing basis to adapt to the market situation, and contains rules on which derivatives can be used for hedging, which counterparties can be used, and the risk profile that is to be applied.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk arises due to imbalances between income and costs in each individual currency and because Novozymes has more assets than liabilities in foreign currencies in connection with global operations.\n\nHedging of currency risk is carried out in the currencies in which Novozymes has the largest exposure. Hedging is managed by entering into derivatives such as forward contracts, currency options and swaps. Loans and deposits in foreign currencies are also utilized for hedging purposes. Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis by comparing changes in the timing and value of the expected exposure in the relevant currencies with the timing and value changes for the designated cash flow hedging transaction.\n\nWhere deemed appropriate, currency risk related to net investments in foreign subsidiaries is hedged by taking out loans and entering into swaps. Currently, there are no open transactions used to hedge equity investments.\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2020\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on net profit and other comprehensive income of a 5% change in DKK versus the key currencies to which Novozymes was exposed at December 31, 2020. For other comprehensive income, the analysis shows the impact on currency translation of net investments and does not include the impact of cash flow hedges, as these relate to future commercial transactions.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis reflects the transaction and translation risk, and assumes that the exchange rates change on December 31, 2020, while all other variables remain constant. The table shows the effect of an increase in exchange rates. A decrease in the exchange rates would have the opposite effect.\n\n| Foreign exchange analysis   |                             | 2020                  | 2020                                   | 2019                  | 2019                                   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| DKK million                 | Increase in  exchange rates | Change in net  profit | Change in other  comprehensive  income | Change in net  profit | Change in other  comprehensive  income |\n| CHF                         | 5.0%                        | -                     | 49                                     | -                     | 54                                     |\n| CNY                         | 5.0%                        | (3)                   | 113                                    | (4)                   | 112                                    |\n| USD                         | 5.0%                        | (2)                   | 227                                    | (1)                   | 250                                    |\n| Other                       | 5.0%                        | -                     | 68                                     | 7                     | 70                                     |\n| Total                       |                             | (5)                   | 457                                    | 2                     | 486                                    |\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2021 estimate\n\nOperating profit (EBIT) is exposed to exchange rate developments, as the effect of hedges is included in financial income/costs. EBIT is mainly exposed to USD and EUR. A movement of 5% in the USD/DKK exchange rate would result in a change in the expected EBIT for 2021 of around DKK 130-160 million (2020: DKK 130-160 million). A 5% movement in the EUR/DKK exchange rate would result in a change in expected EBIT for 2021 of around DKK 200 million (2020: DKK 200 million).\n\nOf the expected USD cash flows for 2021, 88% have been hedged by forward contracts at an average rate of DKK 6.41 at the end of 2020. As a result, the impact on net profit from changes in the USD/DKK exchange rate has been reduced significantly compared with the impact on EBIT.",

        "page_content": "## 5.1 Financial risk factors and risk management (continued)\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises in relation to interestbearing assets and liabilities. In accordance with Novozymes' Treasury Policy, a minimum of 30% of loans must be at fixed interest rates. Hedging of the interest rate risk is managed by entering into fixed-rate loans and interest rate swaps.\n\nWith the current hedging of interest rate risk, an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate on Novozymes' net interest-bearing debt would have a negative effect on net profit of DKK 2 million (2019: negative effect of DKK 10 million). At December 31, 2020, 69% (2019: 59%) of the loan portfolio carried fixed interest rates.\n\nNo loans, credit facilities or other financial instruments held by Novozymes are impacted by the IBOR reform.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises especially for cash and cash equivalents, derivatives, trade receivables and contract assets. The credit risk on trade receivables and contract assets is countered by thorough, regular analysis based on customer type, country and specific conditions. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents as well as on derivatives is mitigated by the Treasury Policy, which limits exposure solely to counterparties that have an investment-grade credit rating. Credit risk is calculated on the basis of net market values and is governed by the Treasury Policy. Novozymes has entered into netting agreements (ISDA or similar) with all the banks used for trading in financial instruments, which means that Novozymes' credit risk is limited to net assets.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Group considered its maximum credit risk to be DKK 4,021 million (2019: DKK 4,051 million), which is the total\n\nof the Group's financial assets. At December 31, 2020, the maximum credit risk related to a single counterparty was DKK 399 million (2019: DKK 279 million).\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIn connection with the Group's ongoing financing of operations, including refinancing, efforts are made to ensure adequate and flexible liquidity. This is guaranteed by using committed credit facilities and placing free funds in deposits, government bonds or ultraliquid mortgage bonds in accordance with the Treasury Policy.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Novozymes' financial resources amounted to DKK 6,522 million (2019: DKK 4,174 million), consisting of net cash and cash equivalents, overdraft facilities and undrawn committed credit facilities of DKK 5,344 million, which expire in 2021-2025.\n\nWith the exception of debt to credit institutions, the maturity dates are primarily within 12 months.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nNovozymes favors a conservative balance which is reflected by a target for net interestbearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. At December 31, 2020, the ratio was 0.8x and thus the capital structure is in line with the target. The capital structure is mainly managed using two instruments: 1) Dividend payments where Novozymes aims for a payout ratio of around 50%. For 2020, the payout ratio is expected to be 51.9% which is in line with the communicated target. 2) Stock buybacks, where a program of DKK 1,500 million was executed in 2020. A new program of up to DKK 1,500 million is planned for 2021.",

The derivatives are not traded on an active market based on quoted prices, but are individual contracts. The fair value of these assets is determined using valuation techniques that utilize market-based data such as exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and volatilities. Other financial assets and contingent considerations are measured at fair value based on nonobservable data (level 3 input). There are no financial instruments measured at fair value on the basis of quoted prices (level 1 input).",

A summary of the Management remuneration can be found in the Governance section of the annual report.\n\n## Executive Leadership Team\n\nRemuneration of the Executive Leadership Team comprises a base salary, pension contribution, a cash bonus (short-term incentive program), stock-based incentive programs (long-term incentive programs) and other benefits (car, telephone, etc.). The variable components of the total remuneration (cash bonus and stock-based incentive programs) are relatively high compared with the base salary and is subject\n\nto the achievement of individual targets and Novozymes' targets for financial, social and environmental performance. The annual cash bonus cannot exceed 9.5 months' fixed base salary, of which 65% is expected to be payable at target performance. The stock-based incentive programs are described in Note 6.2.\n\nMembers of the Executive Leadership Team have contracts of employment containing standard conditions for executive officers of Danish listed companies, including the periods of notice that both parties are required to give and noncompetition clauses. If an executive officer's contract of employment is terminated by the company without any misconduct on the part of the executive officer, the executive officer has a notice period of 12 months. In addition to the notice period, the executive officer has a right to termination compensation of 12 months' base salary and pension contributions. However, executive\n\nofficers appointed before 2016 had a right to compensation of up to two years' base salary and pension contributions.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not based on incentives.\n\n## Changes to the Executive Leadership Team\n\nOn February 1, 2020, Ester Baiget joined Novozymes as new Chief Executive Officer. Ester Baiget replaced CEO Peder Holk Nielsen, who left Novozymes at the end of January 2020. Peder Holk Nielsen's severance package was fully expensed in 2019.\n\nIn September 2020, Novozymes announced a change to the organizational structure. As part of the re-organization, Graziela Chaluppe dos Santos Malucelli and Claus Crone Fuglsang joined the Executive Leadership Team,\n\nwhile Andrew Fordyce, former Executive Vice President, Food & Beverages left Novozymes, and Thomas Videb\u00e6k, Executive Vice President and COO, will leave the company during 2021. Thomas Videb\u00e6k will act as interim EVP for People & Organization, Sustainability and Branding, as well as EVP Strategy & Business Transformation.\n\nThe severance packages of Andrew Fordyce and Thomas Videb\u00e6k, totaling DKK 61 million, were fully expensed in 2020. The severance packages consist of salary and bonuses during the notice period (12 months) as well as termination compensation (18 and 24 months respectively), and compensation for not being part of a stock-based incentive program in 2020-21. Furthermore, the remaining value of awarded stock and stock options (DKK 4 million) has been expensed.",

        "page_content": "## 6.2 Stock-based payment\n\nNovozymes has established stock-based incentive programs for the Executive Leadership Team, vice presidents, directors, and other employees. The purpose of these programs is to ensure an alignment of interests of the Management, employees and shareholders. Allocation of programs has been, and remains, dependent on profit, valuecreation and, in some cases, sustainability targets being achieved. The exercise price and the share price of a stock option are identical at the date of grant.\n\nA new incentive program for the Executive Leadership Team was established in 2020, covering the performance period 2020-2022. The program is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock options and half in stock. The total number of stock options and stock achievable is divided into two categories: 'target stock options and target stock' and 'extra stock options and extra stock'. The target stock options, and target stock correspond to 65% of the maximum stock options and stock, and extra stock options and extra stock correspond to 35% of the maximum stock options and stock. Compared to previous programs the targets reflect an increased weight on organic sales growth (40%), an explicit and increased weight on sustainability targets (20%) and a reduced but still prominent weight on Economic Profit (40%). The targets are aligned with the updated strategy and the business measures for the period 2020-2022.\n\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes reaches the mid-term targets for 2020-2022 for sales growth and economic profit and on all four measures for the sustainability targets, then the target stock options and the target stock will be granted. Extra stock options and extra stocks will not be granted.\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes manages to outperform compared to the mid-term targets, some or all of the extra stock options and extra stock may be granted.\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes does not meet the mid-term targets for 2020-2022, then none or only part of the target stock options and target stock will be granted.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nThe total target-level fair value of the program at the date of grant was approximately DKK 40 million. The value of the stock will be expensed over the three-year qualifying period (20202022) and will be released in 2023. The stock options have a vesting period of four years, followed by an exercise period of five years. The fair value of the stock options will be expensed over the four-year vesting period.\n\nFurthermore, a new program was established in 2020 for vice presidents and directors covering the performance period 2020-2022 (195 vice presidents and directors). The total target level fair value at grant date was DKK 55 million and based on the same requirements and targets as for the Executive Leadership Team. The program is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock and half in stock options. The stock options have a four-year vesting period, while the stock will be released in 2023.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Executive Leadership Team to choose to limit the total allocation of stock and stock options if the intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nFor other employees, a new stock option-based incentive program was established in 2020 covering the performance period 2020-2022. The employee program follows the same requirements and targets as the program for the Executive Leadership Team and the program for vice presidents and directors.\n\nThe Executive Leadership Team and other senior management, who are already included in an existing incentive program, are excluded from this new program. In total, approximately 5,700 employees will be covered by the program. The awarded stock options have a vesting period of four years, after which there is an exercise period of five years. The target level value of the program is approximately DKK 40 million.\n\nIn previous years, stock option programs were established for all or selected groups of employees, conferring the right to purchase one share per stock option. Allocations were made based on each individual employee's base salary and the achievement of a series of business targets - both financial and nonfinancial - set by the Board of Directors for each year. The stock options have a vesting period of three to four years, followed by an exercise period of five years. In order to exercise the options, the employee must still be employed at the exercise date. This does not apply to persons who have retired, taken voluntary early retirement or been given notice.",

        "page_content": "## 6.2 Stock-based payment (continued)\n\nDuring 2020, DKK 54 million arising from stock-based payment was recognized in the income statement (2019: DKK 46 million), DKK 53 million of which was from equity-settled programs (2019: DKK 45 million) and DKK 1 million was from cash-settled programs (2019: DKK 1 million).\n\nMost programs are equity settled, and no liability is recognized for these. If allocations under the programs are made in countries where ownership of foreign stock is not permitted, the value of stock options is settled in cash instead, and a liability of DKK 15 million was recognized for this in 2020 (2019: DKK 16 million). The intrinsic value of exercisable cash-settled programs in 2020 was DKK 13 million (2019: DKK 14 million).\n\nThe fair value of employee services received is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Fair value at grant date is measured in accordance with the Black-Scholes model, using the average exercise price, the option term and the following significant assumptions:\n\n|                                            |     | 2020   |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|\n| Expected future dividends per share        | DKK | 39.6   |   37.4 |\n| Volatility                                 | %   | 22.1   |   23.2 |\n| Annual risk-free interest rate             | %   | (0.6)  |    0   |\n| Weighted average share price at grant date | DKK | 351    |  275   |\n\nFurthermore, the options are assumed to be exercised two years after the vesting period, on average, or at the option's expiry date if this is within one year. Volatility is estimated using the historical volatility over the last three years. The risk-free interest rate is based on Danish government bonds with a maturity equivalent to the option's term to maturity.\n\n## Stock awards\n\nThe stock allocated under the three-year programs is stock awards. The majority of the stocks was allocated in 2017. In 2020, 108,242 stock awards with a fair value of DKK 38 million were granted to new employees enrolled in the programs (2019: DKK 3 million).\n\nThe total number of outstanding stock awards at December 31, 2020 was 108,242 (2019: 307,262). The fair value of these at December 31, 2020 was DKK 38 million (2019: DKK 100 million), which will be expensed over the threeyear period (2020-2022).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Group has established stock-based incentive programs comprising equitysettled and cash-settled programs.\n\nThe fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of stock options and stock awards is measured with reference to the fair value of the stock options and stock awards granted. The fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\n\nThe fair value of stock-based payment at the grant date is recognized as an employee cost over the period in which the stock options vest. In measuring the fair value, account is taken of the number of employees expected to gain entitlement to the options as well as the number of options the employees are expected to gain. This estimate is adjusted at the end of each reporting period such that only the number of options to which employees are entitled or expected to be entitled is recognized.\n\nThe value of equity-settled programs is recognized in Shareholders' equity. The value of cash-settled programs, which are recognized as Other liabilities, is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, and the subsequent adjustment is recognized in the income statement under Financial income or Financial costs.",

The Board of Directors and Management believe that settlement or continuation of these cases will not have a significant effect on the Group's financial position. A liability is recognized under Provisions where the risk of a loss on a legal case is considered more likely than not.\n\n## Contract conditions\n\nSeveral of the partnership contracts to which Novozymes is a party may be terminated by the other party in the event of significant changes in ownership or control of Novozymes. Furthermore, a few contracts contain provisions that restrict Novozymes' licenses from using specific forms of technology in such situations.\n\nNovozymes is committed to increasing production capacity in Latin America if a specific customer reaches certain milestones. The amount required to meet this commitment cannot be estimated reliably at the moment.",

Monitoring our environmental data is key to measuring progress against the ambitious goals we have adopted. We have a high  focus on reducing CO2 emissions from our own operations and on  being more circular in the use of natural resources by reducing our footprint in other environmental areas like water, energy, waste and biodiversity.\n\nRenewable energy share of total energy consumption\n\n43%\n\nm 3 of water saved due to water efficiency projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n45,000\n\nPercentage of biomass waste handled in a circular set-up\n\n97%\n\n117",

Climate change also impacts Novozymes' supply chain as well as operations, and it is important we address related risks through appropriate measures.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes has established an ambitious climate strategy that drives our approach to addressing climate-change-related impacts across our value chain. The Operations, Supply & Quality function and the Global Sustainability department are responsible for driving the climate change action agenda both within and outside Novozymes.\n\nClimate change poses multiple risks, transitional as well as physical, to our business and we have set up an internal process to manage key climate-related risks.\n\nIn addition to our full disclosure to CDP climate change, we strongly support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and are in the process of its implementation.\n\nNovozymes' approach to making its operations less carbon intensive is based on two levers: implementing various energy efficiency projects and increasing the share of renewable energy consumption. Our efforts to reduce operational CO 2 emissions are driven by our science-based targets. We have committed to reduce our absolute Scope 1 & 2 CO 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 (relative to 2018) on our way to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We have also committed to reduce absolute Scope 3 CO 2 emissions from the purchased goods and services category by 15% by 2030 (relative to 2018). To drive performance towards these commitments, we have set mid-term targets (2020-2022) for reducing absolute CO 2 emissions from operations by 40% by 2022 (relative to 2018). We have also defined annual internal targets to guide implementation.\n\nMany Novozymes solutions enable our customers to reduce CO 2 emissions from their products. Novozymes has committed to help the world limit global warming increase to 1.5 o C by saving 60 million tons of CO 2 by enabling low-carbon fuels in the transport sector in 2022.\n\nNovozymes conducts peer-reviewed cradleto-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to document the environmental impact of our solutions. These studies are used to keep our stakeholders informed and to demonstrate to our customers ways to reduce their CO 2 emissions and leverage the positive impact on climate change made possible by Novozymes' solutions. To learn more, please find our approach to LCA at Novozymes.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nReported CO 2 emissions comprise scope 1, scope 2 and emissions from outbound transport of products.\n\n- CO 2 from internally generated energy (scope 1) is calculated based on the amount of fuel consumed, using local emission factors.\n- CO 2 from externally generated energy (scope 2) is reported in accordance with both the market-based and the location-based methods, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. The location-based method assumes zero CO 2 emissions from sourced renewable energy and uses CO 2 factors from International Energy Agency (IEA) for non-renewable energy. The market-based method uses CO 2 factors from IEA.\n\nAlso, Novozymes continues to support global climate action, including through responsible public advocacy and partnerships. In many geographies, Novozymes actively supports policies to promote the use of sustainable, lowcarbon fuels.\n\nSee our position paper on climate change at Novozymes.com\n\nTransport-related CO 2 emissions (scope 3) are calculated based on principles described in the GHG Protocol. Reported quantities comprise CO 2 emissions related to transport from all primary enzyme production sites to customers where Novozymes pays for the freight. Transport between production sites is also included. Transport of raw materials to a production site is not included. CO 2 emissions generated at external warehouses are not included. Emissions data are calculated based on distance and emission factors from the GHG Protocol.\n\nThe environmental impact potentials for global warming and ozone layer depletion are calculated on the basis of data published by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Montreal Protocol published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).",

Many of the raw materials required in our operations are agriculture-based and need water for production. At the same time, some of Novozymes' existing solutions, specifically in textile and laundry, enable our customers to reduce water consumption compared with conventional methods, and improve wastewater quality by replacing chemicals. Further, our solutions improve processes in the wastewater treatment industry. Therefore, water remains one of our priority focus areas as it presents both risks and opportunities across our value chain.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes is committed to ensure water use that is clean, efficient and respects the capacity of the planet thereby contributing to long-term water security for all. Our 2030 ambition on water is to manage water in balance with local conditions. We have a short-term target to develop contextual water management programs for all our key sites by 2022, which will help us focus our efforts in the\n\nregions where it is needed the most and where we can make the maximum impact. We also recognize that internal water-related risks are often a result of water challenges that exist in the local water basin and it requires collective action and efforts beyond our own boundary to address them effectively. Read more about our water stewardship approach in our position paper on water.\n\nIn our operations, we focus on improving water efficiency and ensuring compliance with wastewater discharge regulations at all our sites to reduce our freshwater consumption and improve the quality of water that leaves our boundary.\n\nThe wastewater and biomass treatment at our production sites are given high priority and our wastewater is treated internally or externally in biological wastewater treatment systems before being discharged to a final destination point or used in agriculture for irrigation. All water efficiency and wastewater management efforts are managed by Novozymes' Operations, Supply and Quality function.\n\n## Water by primary source\n\n| 1,000 m 3        | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------|--------|--------|\n| Drinking water   | 5,473  | 5,288  |\n| Industrial water | 2,177  | 2,214  |\n| Steam            | 348    | 343    |\n| Water, total     | 7,998  | 7,845  |\n\nThe table provides a breakdown of total water consumed.\n\n## Five-year water consumption\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1,000 m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nWater includes drinking water, industrial water and externally supplied steam.

WWF will help us to develop contextual water programs for our key sites that will ensure our efforts are focused on addressing the priority operational and basin water challenges. This year, we developed contextual water management programs for two of our sites in China and have identified water targets that will help us address water challenges in and around these sites.\n\nNovozymes has also joined the Science Based Targets Network's (SBTN) Freshwater Hub working group driving the development of methodology for science-based targets for water.\n\nThe table provides a breakdown of total wastewater generated in 2020.\n\n## Wastewater treatment\n\n| 1,000 m 3                      |     | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|\n| Wastewater used for irrigation |     | 662    | 774    |\n| Wastewater discharged          |     | 5,809  | 5,373  |\n| Wastewater volume, total       | ESG | 6,471  | 6,147  |\n\nWithin our operations, we achieved watersavings of 45,000 m 3 for the year through water reduction and re-use projects. This year, we also initiated a large water savings project at our Tianjin site in China which when completed will contribute to estimated water savings of around 150,000 m 3 annually through the re-use of water for cooling towers and our internal processes, among other things.\n\nTo further expand our water stewardship efforts in India, Novozymes initiated work on the ambitious water project 'NOWO Novozymes Water Opulence' to address water-scarcity situation in the neighboring villages near our production site in Patalganga near Mumbai. The project, which is being implemented in close collaboration with, Anarde, a local NGO that aims to raise the underground water table in the area, empowers villagers to be self-reliant for water, and educates them on its efficient and appropriate use.\n\nGoing forward, we will focus on completing the development of contextual water management programs for all our key sites and further expand our water stewardship efforts.

We aim to have all key materials and waste managed in circular systems by 2030.\n\nNovozymes has 17 major sites. As waste management is a complex issue subject to a diverse set of local regulations and involving several external service providers, we have adopted a site-specific management approach.\n\n## Biomass\n\nThe biomass generated during production makes up 97% of Novozymes' total waste. The biomass is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, and the energy can be recovered in biogas facilities. As part of our strategy, we have a target of achieving 100% circular management of our biomass by 2022.\n\nIn 2020, 97% of our biomass volume was handled in a circular set-up with nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, being used in agriculture. The biomass is distributed to local farmers or used as a raw material for fertilizer production. A part of the biomass is also sent through biogas plants to produce biogas on its organic content prior to being used in agriculture.

To develop local solutions, we are working actively with local experts and service providers to explore site-specific opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, we developed zero waste programs for three of our major sites, located in Denmark.\n\nSpecifically on hazardous waste, in 2020, we introduced several measures to reduce both its generation and environmental impact. They include expansion of our internal recycling capability, local process improvements and engagement with local organizations to safely reuse or recycle specific types of hazardous waste.\n\nIn 2020, we increased our hazardous waste recycling capacity at two of our major sites. Due to the planned expansion, we safely diverted some of the hazardous waste from incineration in 2019 and we recycled it in 2020 - this explains the increase in the reported\n\n- hazardous waste for 2020.\n\n## Circular packaging\n\nWe are committed to minimizing the impact of the waste generated by our packaging. Therefore, by 2022 we will have circular plans for all our key packaging materials in key markets. We are working to minimize our packaging footprint by making our packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable.",

        "page_content": "## 7.7 Product stewardship\n\nNovozymes is committed to ensuring product safety and stewardship in our operations and across our value chain. Many of our biological solutions serve as ingredients in consumer goods (e.g. in laundry detergents) or are used for manufacturing consumer products such as food, textile and paper.\n\nNovozymes' ambition is to continue supplying safe products and substitute hazardous substances in its operations using safer and more sustainable alternatives wherever possible. Novozymes strives to reduce the risk of enzyme allergies among employees and downstream users by promoting adherence to enzyme safety standards.\n\n## Our approach\n\nProduct stewardship is an integral part of Novozymes' Quality Management System, and our approach is outlined in the Quality and Product Safety Policy. Novozymes constantly strives to reduce the risk of potential harm to both human health and the environment during the manufacture, handling and use of its products. This approach is implemented by means of many cross-functional teams, and the primary responsibility rests with Regulatory Affairs & Product Safety functions. Procedures ensuring product stewardship are enforced globally and audited by the independent external body Bureau Veritas.\n\nNovozymes measures performance in product stewardship, through internal targets that guide our progress, particularly in the areas of product safety and hazardous substance management. We have also developed a position on and approach to related topics such as product information and labeling, traceability, industrial biotechnology, animal testing, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) and FIAP (Food Improvement Agents Package). Our position papers on animal testing and industrial biotechnology are available at Novozymes.com.\n\nNovozymes chairs the Enzyme Safety Working Group, which plays a coordinating role within The Association of Manufacturers and Formulators of Enzyme Products (AMFEP) in the EU. In addition, Novozymes is a co-chair of the Safety and Sustainability Committee in Enzyme Trade Association (ETA) in the US. Through both of these groups, Novozymes has developed advanced safety standards for enzyme use.\n\nAn annual cross-functional process has recently been established to explore the potential phase-out and substitution of hazardous substances and materials. Every year, new and existing chemicals are screened for environmental, health and safety impacts,\n\nfollowed by risk and feasibility assessments to determine candidates for potential phase-out.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\nNovozymes remains firmly committed to maintaining high-quality dossiers that document product safety and transparency under relevant regulatory schemes such as REACH and FIAP. With its extensive experience in responding to increasing global regulatory requirements, Novozymes worked in 2020 on developing compliance with new REACH-like regulations in South Korea, Turkey, UK, India and other countries. Novozymes also strongly supports and complies with regulation on the reduction of chemicals of concern such as microplastics and 1.4-dioxane.\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes established an internal governance committee to guide implementation and decisions in the phase-out of hazardous substances. Within our annual process cycle, we also identified top candidates to explore potential phase-outs in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, through the AMFEP, Novozymes published an industry guideline on the 'Safe Handling of Enzymes in Pulp and Paper Manufacturing' in collaboration with the Confederation of European Paper Industries.\n\nFurthermore, as a member of the American Cleaning Institute (ACI), Novozymes took part in the update of the guideline for 'Risk Assessment of Enzyme-Containing Consumer Products'.\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to prioritize product stewardship practices at Novozymes. One example is, we will focus on establishing a systematic follow up on the identified hazardous substance candidates to explore the feasibility of phasing them out and developing appropriate substitution strategies. Another example of a new initiative in 2021 will be the development of safety guidelines for the feed industry in collaboration with the EU Association of Specialty Feed Ingredients and their Mixtures (Fefana).",

Therefore, it is important for Novozymes to focus on employee development and diversity in all operations. Novozymes is responsible for ensuring that human rights are respected throughout its value chain.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe have adopted a common management approach and reporting structure for labor practices and human rights. Our People and Organization (P&O) function, together with leaders across Novozymes are responsible for ensuring equal rights for all employees and for promoting diversity. We are committed to ensuring equal opportunities and avoiding discrimination based on race, religion, gender or age in our global organization.\n\nIn Novozymes, we have a policy for diversity and equal opportunities, which covers the entire workforce. Accordingly, the monitoring and the measures implemented to improve diversity in Novozymes cover all layers of management. One of Novozymes' primary priorities on the diversity agenda has been to increase the number of women in senior management.\n\nNovozymes is committed to providing a work environment where all individuals can work together comfortably and productively, free of any kind of harassment and discrimination. Novozymes recognizes and respects the right\n\nto form and join associations and to bargain collectively. Our P&O function works together with local leadership to facilitate the fulfillment of these fundamental rights in countries with limited labor legislation.\n\nNovozymes respects human rights as defined by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and has implemented them in our operational policies and procedures. We respect the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and, since 2001, we have been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact. Novozymes is also a signatory to the Women's Empowerment Principles.\n\nWe publish an annual statement under the UK Modern Slavery Act.\n\nIn 2019, we defined targets for 2020-2022 focused on building a culture where our employees can thrive, grow and perform to bring out their best. Novozymes aims to nurture diversity, and to achieve a score of 86 on our diversity index by 2022. The diversity index is calculated based on gender and national representation at management and other job levels. By 2022, we aim to achieve an 80-point rating on Enable learning in our employee survey. For the Zymer spirit index, our target is to achieve a score of 81 by 2022.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\n## Labor practices\n\nThe Enable learning target and excite zymers target are based on our annual employee survey. In 2020, in our employee survey, we achieved a score of 78 points on Enable learning, and a score of 81 on our Zymer spirit index. The employee survey is an important tool that enables us to not only track the organizational mood but also to make room for better and more relevant team talks focusing on how we work together at Novozymes.\n\nThese tools are critical to ensuring our success as a business and for sustaining our reputation as a great place to work.\n\nWe also believe in promoting diversity at work and this year, for our nurture diversity target, we achieved 83 on our diversity index, which is based on gender and nationality.\n\nWe are on track to achieving our 2022 targets.\n\n## Employee statistics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                   |       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Rate of employee turnover - retirement                                            | %     | 1.2    | 1.0    |\n| Rate of employee turnover - dismissal                                             | %     | 3.0    | 5.7    |\n| Rate of employee turnover - voluntary                                             | %     | 4.5    | 6.0    |\n| Rate of employee turnover, total                                                  | %     | 8.7    | 12.7   |\n| Rate of absence                                                                   |       |        |        |\n| Senior management, management, professional  and administrative                   | %     | 1.1    | 1.2    |\n| Skilled workers, laboratory technicians, other  technicians and process operators | %     | 2.8    | 2.6    |\n| All employees                                                                     | %     | 1.9    | 1.9    |\n| Other employee statistics                                                         |       |        |        |\n| Average age                                                                       | Years | 42.0   | 42.0   |\n| Average seniority                                                                 | Years | 10.0   | 10.1   |\n| Number of expatriates                                                             | No.   | 19     | 22     |\n| Average training cost spent per employee                                          | DKK   | 3,871  | 3,351  |\n| Costs as percentage of total employee costs                                       | %     | 0.7    | 0.5    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 8.1 Labor practices & human rights (continued)\n\nIn 2020, we converted our policy for diversity and equal opportunities into action by ensuring that diversity became a design criterion in our 2020 reorganization. To increase diversity following our reorganization, we have initiatives targeting the recruitment process where we held bias training for recruiters and developed relevant material for hiring managers. Further, our local offices partner with organizations to support diverse long lists of candidates. Novozymes engages in forums to learn about and promote gender equality and this year we focused on the challenges caused by COVID-19. For example, we are active in the 'UN Women' and 'Advancing Women in Agriculture Conference'. Novozymes' President and CEO Ester Baiget was invited to ring the bell for Gender Equality together with UNGC Denmark, Nasdaq Copenhagen, UN Women and other leaders. We are continuously tracking the impact of our initiatives, for example, gender diversity of new hires and internal transfers, and overall, we have made progress to ensure gender diversity in management levels. In 2020, 33% of our senior management were female.\n\nNovozymes believes that respectful, professional conduct furthers Novozymes' mission and is fundamental to a good workplace. This year, we launched a global non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy and company-wide global training for all employees on these topics.\n\nIn 2020, the enrollment of leaders in our leadership development program ''Lead the Way' increased to ~70% from ~57% in 2019. The program was impacted by COVID-19 as trainings were cancelled, postponed or changed to virtual sessions, which did not suit all participants. The rate of employee turnover decreased to 8.7% from 12.7% in 2019. We recorded a 1.9% rate of absence, which is in line with last year. The rate of absence has been broken down into grouped job categories, based on whether the work carried out is primarily office-based.\n\n## Human rights/uni00A0\n\nWe conduct regionally focused human rights impact assessments to identify and assess human rights risks and impacts in our business and supplier base. As human rights risks vary from region to region, this approach enables us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of human rights risks, our positioning and the associated gaps within the respective regions.\n\nIn 2020, we conducted the human rights impact assessment for The Americas. In the past two years, we have completed assessments for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region and India. Through these assessments, we identified the most salient human rights, and are taking appropriate measures to mitigate the identified risks and gaps. Our aim is to complete the assessment for China in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nAbsence is defined as time lost due to an employee's illness, including sick leave, and occupational injuries and diseases. The rate of absence is calculated as the number of registered days of absence as a percentage of the total number of normal working days in one year, less vacation and public holidays.\n\nThe rate of employee turnover is calculated as employee turnover divided by the average number of permanent employees. Employee turnover is measured as the number of permanent employees leaving the Group during the preceding year (excluding employees at divested entities transferred to the acquiring company).\n\nAverage age and seniority are calculated as the sum of employees' total age/seniority in whole years at the reporting date, divided by the number of employees.\n\nExpatriation refers to Novozymes employees temporarily reassigned within Novozymes from the country of original employment for periods of more than six months.\n\nTraining costs express the cost of external training courses and seminars, translated into Danish kroner at average exchange rates. Training costs are also shown as a percentage of total employee costs.\n\nWomen in senior management measures the percentage of women in director positions or higher (i.e. director, vice president or executive vice president).\n\nNurture Diversity index measures the ratio of women and international employees at both Senior management and Management level. If women and international employees are represented at the same ratio in all management layers as in the academic population in Novozymes as such, the index would be 100.\n\nThe Zymer spirit and Enable learning are derived from specific questions in the annual employee survey questionnaire. The resulting score is a value between 0 and 100.\n\nThe 'Lead the Way' program indicates the number of leaders globally who have been registered for the leadership development program 'Lead the Way'. It is shown as a percentage of total number of leaders in Novozymes.",

The aim is to ensure that robust safety processes, equipment, standards, tools and training are fully integrated into the way we work. We take appropriate measures to ensure focus on occupational health and safety across the organization, by means of initiatives owned and driven locally under a global framework.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' Quality, Environment and Safety function is responsible for supporting the organization in ensuring a safe and healthy work environment. To reinforce our safety culture, we have a global Health and Safety Policy, along with internal standards and procedures. We monitor our performance and ensure continuous improvement through benchmarking of both internal and external key performance indicators.\n\nWe define annual targets to ensure we continue to improve our performance on health and safety.\n\nIn 2019, as part of our strategy update, we increased our focus on health and wellbeing and defined new ambitions and programs on these topics. Our main target is to drive down the three-year rolling average of lost-time injury frequency rate to 1.5 per million working hours by 2022 relative to a 2017-19 baseline of 1.6 per million working hours.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\nAs for most companies, the COVID-19 pandemic posed a huge challenge to Novozymes in 2020 and our regional leadership teams and OHS professionals were instrumental in handling the situation and keeping employees safe and production running. We are successfully addressing the different challenges across the world through our regional task force teams that are led by our regional senior leadership.\n\nIn 2020, we met our target to drive down the three-year rolling average of lost-time injury frequency rate to 1.5.\n\nThe performance this year was recorded at 1.3 compared with 0.9 in 2019.\n\nThis year, in occupational health and safety, we followed a risk and data-based strategy when defining clear category themes such as traffic in outdoor areas, exposure to chemicals, struck by object (e.g. falling items) and maintenance hazards.\n\n## Consequences of occupational injuries\n\n| No.                                                                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Return to original job                                                 | 13     | 10     |\n| Return to a different job in the same department                       | -      | -      |\n| Out of work or early retirement                                        | -      | -      |\n| Case pending                                                           | 1      | -      |\n| Occupational injuries with absence, total                              | 14     | 10     |\n| Total days of absence related to injuries registered in the  same year | 400    | 351    |\n| Injury severity rate                                                   | 29     | 35     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOccupational injuries are defined as the reported number of occurrences arising out of or in the course of work that result in fatal or nonfatal injury with at least one day of absence from work other than the day of injury.\n\nOccupational diseases are defined as the number of diseases contracted as a result of exposure to risk factors arising from work activity and notified as work related in accordance with local legislation.\n\nThe consequences of occupational injuries with absence and occupational diseases are measured by recording the work situation once the situation resulting from an incident has stabilized, for example whether the employees have returned to their original jobs, and the total number of calendar days of absence.\n\nFrequencies of occupational injuries with absence are stated per million working hours.\n\nThe injury severity rate is calculated by dividing total days of absence related to injuries registered in the same year by the number of occupational injuries.",

Our global incident handling system CAPTURE has since 2018 enabled us to implement targeted, data and themebased safety initiatives. In 2020, we took CAPTURE a step further by introducing a medical application which allows EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant management of all medical cases.\n\nEnzyme & biological safety is a top priority for Novozymes. In January 2020, we published a scientific study, which concluded that our preventive program for enzyme safety works effectively. Our learnings enable us to further improve the enzyme safety program ZEAL (Zero Enzyme Allergy) and gives inspiration for our biological safety program ZEBRA (Zero\n\nBiological Reactions) for the benefit of both employees and customers. We continuously promote a culture of product safety across the Novozymes organization through our corporate safety culture and awareness activities that promote safe behavior.\n\nFocus on mental wellbeing is an ongoing activity that aims to help and inspire our leaders and employees. One example is our global initiative called BrainSpace.\n\nMoving forward, we will focus on further implementing our strategy, aiming to improve safety in relation to our workplace and products and assure the continued wellbeing of all our employees.",

The business integrity principles underline Novozymes' zero tolerance approach to bribery and define clear rules for gifts and donations. They act as Novozymes' code of conduct in business integrity matters and form the basis of our efforts to eliminate all forms of corruption. See our position paper on business integrity at Novozymes.com.\n\nA dedicated legal compliance function, headed by the Chief Legal Compliance Officer, handles business integrity-related matters and training of our employees. All employees have access to relevant guidance on our intranet and are encouraged to raise any concerns about business integrity to the designated business integrity contacts or through other relevant grievance channels. Novozymes also has a whistleblower system which allows employees and others to report their concerns relating to\n\nbusiness integrity and corruption, fraud and other serious matters.\n\nWe offer mandatory business integrity training annually for our employees in scope. This training is designed and rolled out by the Chief Legal Compliance Officer, based on input from regional lines of business and questions raised during the year to ensure relevance and applicability. This training includes reallife case studies and reinforces employee commitment to business integrity principles.\n\nNovozymes' recurring antitrust training provides general guidance on competition law and is completed by relevant employees in commercial roles across all regions.\n\nNovozymes works proactively to prevent, detect and respond to fraud, corruption and other violations of our business integrity principles, and we continuously promote internal awareness and develop relevant programs or initiatives as required. An internal control system enables identification of potential violations and addresses concerns raised, e.g. through our whistleblower system. All whistleblower reports and all cases on fraud and corruption are reported to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. All allegations of fraud, corruption and other business integrity violations are appropriately investigated in accordance with internal policies and procedures. Substantiated violations will lead to proportionate disciplinary sanctions for the parties involved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nCompletion of business integrity training refers to the percentage of employees in scope who have undergone business integrity training in the latest training period. New entities are included within six months of acquisition. Business integrity training is conducted for employees who can potentially influence third-party interactions or decisions as part of their job role. This comprises employees in professional, managerial or administrative positions.\n\nThe reporting criteria for competition law violations are whether it has been established by an authority member of the International Competition Network or by a competent court anywhere in the world that a company in the Novozymes Group has violated applicable anti-trust regulations. Novozymes defines fraud and corruption as deliberate misconduct with the intent to gain a direct or indirect personal advantage while exposing Novozymes to a financial or reputational loss.",

Our third-party due diligence processes include monitoring and ensuring that our commercial partners conduct business with integrity and share our values regarding legal compliance.\n\nNovozymes' whistleblower system allows employees and others to report their concerns relating to fraud, corruption and other violations of Novozymes' business integrity principles as well as other serious violations\n\nConsequences of substantiated fraud and corruption cases 2020 (2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7  Dismissal\n\n29%\n\n(25%)\n\n- \u00b7 Other disciplinary sanctions 25% (30%)\n- \u00b7 Unknown perpetrator 46% (45%)\n\nof law.

The competition law compliance training this year provided a general reminder on competition law restrictions.\n\nDuring the year, we released a new conflict of interest policy that provides better guidance to employees on identification and proper management of potential conflicts of interests and related risks with respect to business integrity.\n\nReporting channels for potential fraud and corruption 2020 (2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\nWhistleblower/tip-off\n\n13%\n\n(66%)\n\n\u00b7\n\nInternal controls and proactive detection\n\n87%\n\n(34%)\n\nIn 2020, a new dedicated fraud detection e-learning was rolled out to select functions.\n\nConsistent with previous years, there were no violations of competition law in 2020. The number of potential fraud and corruption cases investigated increased in 2020 due to extended use of data mining in internal controls and proactive detection. The nominal number of substantiated cases increased slightly compared to 2019. The substantiated cases had no material business or financial impact.\n\nThe charts below provide further details of the reporting channels and consequences for fraud and corruption cases.",

We believe that our customers' feedback on our solutions and services is of great importance to determining the success and performance of our business. Therefore, customer engagement and value of our partnership is measured across our commercial divisions and across regions.\n\n## Our approach\n\nEach year, we conduct a customer satisfaction survey. This is to monitor customer perceptions of our solutions and services and learn where we can improve.\n\nWe use the survey as a dialogue tool with our customers. Overall customer perceptions are\n\nmeasured via four key performance indicators: Net Promoter Score (NPS), Loyalty Index, Value of Partnership, and Customer Satisfaction Score.\n\nResponsibility for measuring, analyzing and addressing customer satisfaction and performance is anchored with our commercial functions.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\nIn 2020, Novozymes invited 1,063 customers across 100 countries to participate in the survey with a response rate of 58%. We achieved an NPS of 50.\n\nThe results confirm our strong relationships with our customers both large and small, new and old and across emerging and developed markets.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have affected customer perceptions of Novozymes in 2020 compared to previous years.\n\nResponding customers pointed out that it is essential that we continue to deliver innovation to help them become more competitive and within their detailed responses are a number of insights that relate to how we can improve our performance within certain industries and with certain accounts.\n\nGoing forward, we will strive to maintain close relationships with our customers and proactively work on the areas where we can improve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is derived from an annual questionnaire measuring on a scale from 1-10 how likely the customer is to recommend Novozymes to others. The NPS is calculated as the share of promoters (rating us 9 or 10) less the share of detractors (rating us 1-6). The resulting score is a value between -100 and +100.",

We are passionate about delivering on our promise of better lives in a growing world , both inside and outside the workplace.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes has committed to contribute to our local communities and inspire people about the potential of biology. As part of this commitment, Novozymes has set a target to 'Pledge 1% of our time to local outreach activities by 2022'.\n\nOur community engagement initiatives are driven through our Inspire-related initiatives. The Inspire program is governed by strong guardrails to guide implementation and determine eligibility, and is led by a crossfunctional team. The Inspire initiatives are regionally owned and driven by grassroot employee-led initiatives. The Executive Leadership encourages all employees to spend up to 1% of work time in local outreach and workplace sustainability initiatives.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\nInspire is about helping our communities respond to local challenges. In 2020, the biggest crisis we all faced was the COVID-19 pandemic. Our employees in all regions stepped up, contributing with their resources, time, and creativity to help their communities respond to the pandemic and other pressing local issues.\n\nIn China, we donated RMB 1 million via the Red Cross to help build hospitals in Huoshenshan and Leishenshan, procure supplies, and provide support for frontline workers.\n\nIn Denmark, one of our employees, a trained nurse, spent a number of working days to help with COVID-19 testing at Holb\u00e6k Hospital. Another employee, an operator from Kalundborg, was seconded to his former employer who started a large production of hand sanitizer and needed his expertise to keep up with the high demand.\n\nIn India, around 140 Zymers participated in a virtual fitness challenge to raise money for daily-wage earners, whose lives had come to a standstill due to COVID-19. Observing local rules and guidelines, our employees walked an estimated 2.3 million steps in a day raising INR 1.7 million. The sum was donated towards state funds, and organizations involved with disaster management and eradication of hunger.\n\nIn Kenya, Novozymes was awarded by the Marketing Society of Kenya (MSK) for driving Biology amongst the disadvantaged and future generations for funding the upgrade of the Starehe Boys Bio-Lab. Starehe Boy's Centre & School is a charitable institution that runs a high school and a technical training institution for exceptionally talented students with financial constraints.\n\nIn Latin America, to promote digital inclusion especially among underprivileged students, we provided 100 computers with internet access for students of Marista Escola Social Ecol\u00f3gica.\n\nIn North America, our employees helped educators create meaningful content for students learning from home due to COVID-19 restrictions. We worked with local schools to organize virtual chats to discuss career opportunities in the sciences and hosted virtual tours of our site for teachers' professional development. Our North American sites have also supported COVID-19 response of local non-profit organizations. Through in-kind and financial charitable donations, we have helped local food banks, provided protective equipment and sanitizers to local hospitals, and given internet access to students in remote areas so that they can learn online.",

        "page_content": "## 8.6 Responsible sourcing\n\nNovozymes always strives for responsible sourcing and we focus on environment, social and governance (ESG) issues across our value chain. Agricultural raw materials are a major component of our production processes and a secure supply of sustainable raw materials is crucial to Novozymes' production.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' sourcing department drives our supplier management and responsible sourcing program and is anchored within Novozymes Operations, Supply and Quality function. Our approach to responsible sourcing is defined by our Responsible Purchasing Standards (RPS) and managed through our Supplier Performance Management (SPM) process and SEDEX platform. Through the SPM process, Novozymes screens suppliers and classifies their risk based on spend, country and category. In case a supplier does not meet our assessment criteria, either an action plan is established, or an alternate supplier is identified. Furthermore, we aim to use SEDEX to enhance the sustainability aspects of our SPM evaluation going forward. We have started onboarding our key suppliers, with due consideration for risk and spend, to the platform to increase the level of transparency in our supply chain.\n\nNovozymes requires all contracted suppliers to comply with our RPS, as well as, when requested, to complete questionnaires and to accept visits and audits relevant for\n\nconfirmation of compliance with the standards. These standards cover various ESG criteria including respect for human and labor rights, business ethics, employee health and safety and environmental stewardship. All our suppliers of directly sourced agricultural raw materials are required to adhere to our deforestation requirements by not contributing to further deforestation and to have zero tolerance for land grabbing.\n\nTo know more, see our position paper on Responsible Purchasing, and our annual statement on Modern Slavery at Novozymes. com.\n\nWe will continue to focus on our long-term commitment of securing 100% renewable electricity, reducing Scope 3 CO 2 emissions from key raw materials and developing plans to manage 100% key materials and waste in circular systems.\n\n## 2020 highlights\n\nNovozymes continued to expand the use of the SEDEX platform, a sustainability platform, to enhance the transparency of our supply chain. After onboarding high-risk suppliers in 2019, this year our focus has been to onboard high-spend suppliers across Novozymes onto SEDEX, a process which will continue over time.\n\nAs part of Novozymes' journey towards becoming carbon neutral, we are taking various steps to reduce emissions. During 2020, Novozymes initiated additional means to increase the level of renewable electricity sourced.\n\nIn 2020, the entire electricity consumption at Novozymes' Franklinton site was covered by renewable electricity through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (REC), deriving from a nearby solar energy plant.\n\nNovozymes and Novo Nordisk have jointly engaged in a power purchasing agreement with Swedish energy provider Vattenfall AB, to supply the two Danish companies with renewable electricity for the coming decade. As part of our climate target we have also set a science-based Scope 3 target focused on purchased goods and services. For 2020, the target internally has been to identify relevant key suppliers with whom to engage with and to establish supplier engagement plans. For more details, read Note 7.1 Climate change.\n\nDuring 2020, a sustainability hotspot analysis was conducted for all categories of direct sourcing of raw materials across different regions. The results of this exercise will be used to identify key sustainability issues and will serve as input to future sustainable sourcing strategies.\n\nAs a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), 100% of the palm oil we sourced in 2020 was RSPO-certified. Novozymes has further increased its focus on sustainability when sourcing products and services other than raw materials, by including sustainability criteria in the tender supplier evaluations and implementing initiatives to improve sustainability performance within categories prioritized in risk assessments, e.g. waste and internal logistics.\n\nFurthermore, we also completed a Human Rights & Impact assessment of our operations and supplier base in North America and Latin America. Read more about these assessments in Note 8.1 Labor Practices & Human Rights.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one\n\nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether\n\nthe Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial, environmental, social and governance information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Environmental, Social and Governance Data. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1 Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of Novozymes A/S have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act (accounting class D).\n\nThe accounting policies are unchanged from 2019.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied for the consolidated financial statements except as described below. For a description of the Group's accounting policies, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for Novozymes A/S; please refer to the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Recognition and measurement in general\n\nIncome is recognized in the income statement as earned.\n\nAll costs incurred in generating the year's revenue are also recognized in the income statement, including depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.\n\nValue adjustments of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortized cost are also recognized in the income statement.\n\nAssets are recognized in the balance sheet when it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and the value of the asset can be measured reliably. Liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when they are considered probable and can be measured reliably. At initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Assets and liabilities are subsequently measured as described below for each item.\n\nThe recognition and measurement principles take due account of predictable losses and risks occurring prior to the presentation of financial statements that confirm or refute the conditions prevailing at the reporting date.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe accounting policies for intangible fixed assets follow those of the Group with the exception of goodwill, which is amortized over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.\n\nAn amount equal to the total capitalized development costs after tax is recognized under Shareholders' equity in Reserve for development costs.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries and investments in associates are recognized initially at cost and subsequently measured using the equity method. The company's share of the equity of subsidiaries, based on the fair value of the identifiable net assets at the acquisition date, less or plus unrealized intercompany profits or losses, with the addition of any residual value of goodwill, is recognized under Investments in subsidiaries and Investments in associates respectively in the balance sheet. If the shareholders' equity of subsidiaries or associates is negative and Novozymes A/S has a legal or constructive obligation to cover the company's negative equity, a provision is recognized.\n\nNet revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognized under Shareholders' equity in the Revaluation reserve according to the equity method. The reserve is reduced by payments of dividends to the parent company and adjusted to reflect other changes in the equity of subsidiaries.\n\nThe proportionate share of the net profits of subsidiaries less goodwill amortization is recognized under Income from investments in subsidiaries in the income statement. Goodwill in subsidiaries is amortized over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend proposed for the financial year is shown as a separate item under Shareholders' equity.",

It also contains the financial statements of the parent company Novozymes A/S. Together, these constitute the company's annual report as filed with the Danish Business Authority. PwC has audited the consolidated financial statements, the parent company financial statements, and the environmental and social data.\n\nThe audit covers financial, environmental and social data. These are marked 'Audited by PwC.' See also the statements in the report. PwC has not audited the sections of the report under the headings The big picture, Our business, Governance, and Sustainability. The Sustainability section includes our Communication on Progress prepared in accordance with the UN Global Compact principles.\n\nThe report has been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Danish Financial Statements Act and additional requirements of Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S for the presentation of financial statements by listed companies. It is also inspired by the GRI's G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. See Basis of reporting in the report for more details.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements, including statements about future events, future financial performance, plans, strategies and expectations. Forward-looking statements are associated with words such as, but not limited to, 'believe,' 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'estimate,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'could,' 'may,' 'might' and other words with a similar meaning.\n\nForward-looking statements are by their very nature associated with risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, both positively and negatively. These risks and uncertainties may include unexpected developments in i) the ability to develop and market new products; ii)\n\nthe demand for Novozymes' products, marketdriven price decreases, industry consolidation, and launches of competing products or disruptive technologies in Novozymes' core areas; iii) the ability to protect and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; iv) significant litigation or breaches of contract; v) the materialization of the company's growth platforms, notably the opportunity for marketing biomass conversion technologies or the development of microbial solutions for broad-acre crops; vi) political conditions, such as acceptance of enzymes produced by genetically modified organisms; vii) global economic and capital market conditions, including, but not limited to, currency exchange rates (USD/DKK and EUR/DKK in particular, but not exclusively), interest rates and inflation; and viii) significant price decreases for inputs and materials that compete with Novozymes' biological solutions. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future developments or new information.",
