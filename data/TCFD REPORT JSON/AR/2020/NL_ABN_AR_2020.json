        "page_content": "## Introduction by the CEO\n\n## Introduction\n\n2020 was a year like no other, full of change and paradigmshifting events - not only because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but also due to heightened concerns over climate and social change. The Covid-19 pandemic is first and foremost a crisis of personal health and the effects have taken a toll on all of us; flexibility and resilience were put to the test. Social cohesion and solidarity are key to overcome a pandemic and over the last year we have witnessed how governments, businesses, interest groups and communities have taken responsibility and acted together. As many of us stayed home, we looked to connect and support each other. One effect is that the adoption of digital technologies has been accelerated and that many of these changes will be here for the long haul. The start of the roll-out of vaccination programmes at the end of 2020 provides perspective and brings us closer to the start of a new normal.\n\nNavigating the bank through Covid-19 has been a priority in my first year as the CEO of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and we will continue to focus on the wellbeing of our clients and staff. My other priorities for 2020 were to review the strategy to ensure we deliver on our three strategic pillars going forward - customer experience, sustainability and futureproof bank - focus on our license to operate and further enhance the bank's culture.\n\n## Strategy review\n\nA clear vision is essential in navigating the bank through current circumstances. In November, we presented the outcome of the strategy review after already taking decisive action at Q2 to wind down our Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) activities outside Northwest Europe. We made clear choices, creating a distinct profile and focus, and set out a new capital framework and targets for the longer term. We will be a personal bank in the digital age, serving clients where we have scale in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. Our strong brand and attractive market positions provide us with a solid foundation. Our strategic pillars - customer experience, sustainability and futureproof bank - remain our guiding principles in acting on our purpose 'Banking for better, for generations to come'.\n\nOur trusted relationships with clients, together with our capabilities across all client segments, enable us to support them at all important financial steps in their lives. We/uni00A0deliver a convenient daily banking experience increasingly digitally. At moments that matter, we support our clients with sector and sustainability expertise. We will focus on attractive segments where we can grow profitably, building on our strong market positions across all segments. Our clients increasingly need expertise to support them in the sustainability shift and we are their first-choice partner in climate change, the circular economy and social impact. We/uni00A0are building a future-proof bank by rigorously simplifying and centralising our operating model, enabling us to focus on clients and work more efficiently.\n\nThe wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio as announced at Q2 was a first step towards bringing focus and scale in CIB. We are making good progress and we have seen a strong decline in the portfolio, mainly in Trade & Commodity Finance. As the wind-down progresses, CIB will align further with the bank's moderate risk profile, reducing the/uni00A0cost of risk going forward.\n\n## Enhancing the bank's culture and compliance\n\nWe also made progress in our licence to operate and in enhancing the bank's culture, my other priorities. As a value-driven organisation, our decisions and behaviour need/uni00A0to be in line with our purpose and strategy. Taking ownership, setting clear targets and being accountable are key to execution as well as to our licence to operate - as are risk management and compliance, including the fight against money laundering. We are fully committed to our moderate risk profile and our role as a gatekeeper of the financial system. Our culture and licence to operate remain clear priorities. We are making progress in our AML remediation programmes. In the past year, the number of FTEs committed to AML activities grew from around 2,000 FTEs to around 3,800 FTEs. The investigation into our AML activities is ongoing and we continue to fully cooperate.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction by the CEO\n\nKey figures and profile ABN AMRO shares Economic environment Regulatory environment\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial results and capital\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Covid-19, we partly compensated high impairments recorded in the first half of the year and closed the year with a modest loss. The Dutch economy and housing market remained resilient as government programmes aimed at reducing the impact on the economy continued. The financial results for 2020 were marked by Covid-19, but were also impacted by large exceptional client files, continued pressure on deposit margins and lower corporate loan volumes as we reduced the CIB non-core portfolio. In order to re-establish our confirmed risk appetite, we have tightened risk standards, especially in/uni00A0CIB (including Clearing). We reached our cost target of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A05.1 billion for 2020 (excluding the restructuring provisions), delivering on a EUR/uni00A01.1 billion cost savings programme. The resulting return on equity (ROE) was an/uni00A0unsatisfactory -0.8%. Excluding CIB non-core, ROE was/uni00A05.4%.\n\nOur capital position remained very strong, with a fullyloaded Basel III CET1 ratio of 17.7% and a Basel IV CET1 ratio above 15%. I am pleased with our very strong capital position, which provides resilience. Based on the revised ECB recommendation and the loss recorded in 2020, regrettably no dividend will be proposed over 2020. We reconfirm our intention to resume payment of dividends, sustainably, conditions permitting and taking into account ECB recommendations. With a Basel IV CET1 ratio above/uni00A015%, we are well placed to pay FY2019 dividend, conditions permitting./uni00A0\n\n## In conclusion\n\nI am proud of the commitment we have demonstrated to our clients in a year dominated by Covid-19, working closely with the government and other banks. From the start, our priority has been the wellbeing and safety of our clients and colleagues. We have been able to make a difference for many of our clients, true to our purpose 'Banking for better, for generations to come'. Our strategic investments in IT and digital services in the past years have enabled us to continue serving our clients without interruption as we leveraged our digital platforms in video banking, virtual call/uni00A0centres and working from home. We supported around 90,000 clients with automatic deferral of interest and principal payments./uni00A0We will continue to provide support to/uni00A0our clients where possible.\n\nIn our strategy review we made clear choices, resulting in/uni00A0a/uni00A0distinct profile and focus. The bank continues to operate from a position of strength, with a distinct profile, clear strategic focus and a very strong capital position, providing a solid base for future growth in segments where we have focus and scale. We are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the bank as we execute on our strategy.\n\nRobert Swaak\n\nCEO of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction by the CEO\n\nKey figures and profile ABN AMRO shares Economic environment Regulatory environment\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Economic environment\n\n## Covid-19 hits the global economy\n\nIn 2020, the global economy came to a halt. Global industrial output decreased by 4% relative to the previous year and international trade by 5%. The historic economic downturn reflects the unique nature of the Covid-19 crisis, as countries all around the world were plunged simultaneously into a dip and the global economy was confronted with a shock in both demand and supply. Consumers were cautious and stayed at home to minimise the risk of infection. Protective measures inhibited demand, with sectors involving high levels of personal contact, such as the hospitality sector, being forced to close their doors. This demand shock was compounded by a supply shock that saw entire production chains disrupted during the first wave of infections, with factories shutting down and deliveries of essential components stagnating.\n\n## Dutch economy suffers, but less than other economies Sharp drop in GDP in NL\n\n(GDP growth (% year-on-year))\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource:/uni00A0Refinitiv.\n\nCovid-19 also took its toll on the Netherlands as GDP declined by 3.8%, the biggest contraction since World War II. Consumption, investments and net exports were all hit hard. However, the Netherlands suffered less than other countries where ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank operates, such as Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. This was because its lockdown measures during the first wave were less strict, while heavily affected sectors such as tourism account for a relatively limited share of the Dutch economy and the country has a well-developed digital infrastructure. Many employees were able to work from home and online shopping was already popular and picked\n\nup further. The government's announcement that it was willing to extend swift large-scale support bolstered\n\nconfidence among businesses and households. The/uni00A0financial support provided by the government was\n\nlarge, but much lower than in many other countries as the economic downturn was more limited. Public finances remained in relatively good shape.\n\n## Labour market deteriorates in NL Steep increase in unemployment in NL (in % of total labour force)\n\n(in thousands)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource:/uni00A0Refinitiv.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the first wave of Covid-19, the government took action immediately. A wage cost compensation scheme was launched in a bid to protect jobs. A total of 122,000 businesses made use of the temporary emergency bridging measure NOW-1. This scheme ran until/uni00A0June/uni00A02020 and provided protection for some 2.8/uni00A0million employees, which is almost a third of the working population. Subsequent schemes were subject to stricter conditions and the take-up rate steadily decreased. Thanks to all this support, unemployment rose by only 95,000 to 368,000 between/uni00A0March/uni00A0and December. Young workers on flexible contracts, in particular, lost their job. Just before the outbreak, by contrast, the labour market had been extremely tight, with employers struggling to find suitable employees. They were consequently reluctant to lay off their employees and so accepted a temporary decline in productivity. Although the rise in unemployment from 2.9% in/uni00A0March/uni00A0to 3.9% in/uni00A0December/uni00A0was sharp, it was still low from an international perspective.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction by the CEO\n\nKey figures and profile\n\nABN AMRO shares\n\nEconomic environment\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, astute government and central bank action soon restored calm. Governments spent generously to protect jobs and issued credit guarantees to businesses. Although this caused a sharp deterioration in public finances, interest rates barely rose. European government leaders allayed fears of a repeat of the euro crisis by reaching agreement on a European Stability Fund. In the meantime, central banks expanded their monetary policy by providing extra liquidity to banks, lowering their official interest rates, increasing bond-buying budgets and relaxing banks' capital requirements. There was scope for these measures because falling demand kept inflation on a downward trend. Eurozone inflation in 2020 was 0.3%, well below the ECB's target level. In the Netherlands, inflation fell from 2.7% in 2019 to 1.1% in 2020. The various measures ensured that lending could continue as before, while also pushing swap rates even lower, particularly at the long end of the interest rate spectrum. This further flattening of the yield curve underlines the fact that, for banks, the 'lower for longer' discussion is not yet over.\n\n## Ambiguity in the Dutch real estate sector\n\nThe housing and commercial real estate markets reacted very differently to Covid-19. While the housing market received an extra boost, commercial real estate was dealt a/uni00A0severe blow.\n\n## Housing market remains upbeat\n\n## Continued rise in house prices and transactions in NL\n\n(% year-on-year)\n\n(thousands on a yearly basis)\n\nSource:/uni00A0Refinitiv.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Dutch housing market remained in excellent shape during the year, despite the economic downturn and the impending deterioration in the labour market. The number of purchases totalled 236,000, close to the record high of 242,000 in 2017. Throughout the lockdown periods, house sales continued as before, while the number of properties for sale fell. Properties coming onto the market are rapidly snapped up, forcing would-be buyers to act fast. This shortage translated into a further acceleration in house price increases, from 6.9% in 2019 to 7.8% in 2020. Contrary to previous years the largest price increases were measured in more peripheric regions. The persistent decline in mortgage rates is probably the main factor sustaining buyer interest and rising prices. Residential preferences are also shifting due to people spending more time at home and also working from home. Real estate agents have therefore seen a growing interest in properties with a spare room and outdoor space. The higher demand for home conversion mortgages suggests that home owners are also looking to improve their properties in other, more sustainable ways.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction by the CEO\n\nKey figures and profile\n\nABN AMRO shares\n\nEconomic environment\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rental income and prices of office and retail space are under pressure. Businesses are having a hard time and so are postponing investments and soft-pedalling recruitment. This is dampening demand for office space. An/uni00A0even bigger drag on demand may be the trend of working from home. Post Covid-19, businesses are likely to/uni00A0continue to embrace this new practice, with many offices being transformed from workplaces into meeting places. In/uni00A0addition, the likely dwindling demand for office space will push the transformation to residential space even higher up the agenda. The same applies to shops, given that the rise in online shopping means increasing numbers of retail properties are lying vacant. If new uses cannot be found for/uni00A0empty offices and shops, write-downs may need to be/uni00A0made on property values and their collatoral value.

And if these are insufficient, they are increasingly turning to the public capital markets. This applies particularly to the larger companies. Although the Covid-19 crisis forced companies to tap into their financial reserves, the bankruptcy rate remained relatively low. In fact, the number of bankruptcies actually decreased, probably because the government support measures helped companies that would otherwise have gone under to stay afloat. Consequently, some bankruptcies have simply been postponed, and these companies are likely to fail when the government lifeline is/uni00A0withdrawn.\n\n## Strong increase in mortgage lending in NL (EUR billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMortgage production (past 12 month rolling period)\n\nSource:/uni00A0Kadaster.\n\nNew mortgage business in the Netherlands showed strong growth in 2020. The higher volume of transactions and the rise in house prices contributed towards this buoyancy. In/uni00A0addition, many borrowers decided to refinance their mortgages. Low interest rates and the perception that interest rates may rise from this historically low level prompted many borrowers to see this as the right time to remortgage. They had abundant choice as mortgage lenders competed for market share. Most of the new mortgages have long fixed-rate terms, sometimes as long as 30 years. The lavish financial support provided by the government helped to keep mortgage arrears down. In fact, the use of special mortgage holiday schemes remained limited.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction by the CEO\n\nKey figures and profile\n\nABN AMRO shares\n\nEconomic environment\n\nRegulatory environment\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reduced economic activity provoked a sharp fall-off in demand for energy carriers.

Business travel declined and fewer people went on holiday, while those who did go opted less frequently to fly. The decline in demand for oil triggered a collapse in prices.

        "page_content": "## Regulatory environment\n\n## Regulatory developments in 2020\n\nA/uni00A0large number of regulatory developments had a direct bearing on ABN/uni00A0AMRO in 2020. The most important of these developments are summarised below.\n\n## Impact of Covid-19 on the regulatory environment\n\nNew regulations were adopted and existing regulations were amended in response to Covid-19, mainly to support lending while maintaining the bank's liquidity and solvency requirements. The need to focus on these regulatory measures meant the regulators had to postpone some other implementation deadlines and requirements.\n\n## CRR Quick Fix\n\nIn April 2020, the European Commission adopted a banking package aimed at facilitating lending to households and businesses in the EU in response to the Covid-19 crisis. This package came into force in/uni00A0June/uni00A02020 and included an initial set of amendments to the second Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2). These amendments are unofficially referred to as CRR Quick Fix, or CRR2.5, and consist of an Interpretative Communication on the EU's accounting and prudential frameworks, as well as targeted amendments to the EU banking rules. Central bank exposures may also be temporarily excluded from the leverage ratio until/uni00A0June/uni00A02021. For additional information, please refer to Capital in the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\n## Payment holidays and government-guaranteed loans\n\nMeasures providing for payment holidays on loans and advances were introduced in early 2020 to reduce the adverse economic impact of Covid-19. Because the EU Member States adopted these payment holidays in various different forms, the European Banking Authority (EBA) decided in April 2020 to publish Guidelines on the treatment of public and private moratoria in the light of Covid-19 measures. ABN/uni00A0AMRO offered many clients deferrals of interest and principal payments on loans and advances between/uni00A0March/uni00A0and/uni00A0October/uni00A02020.\n\n## ECB recommendation: dividend distributions, share buy-backs and variable remuneration\n\nIn response to the exceptional and challenging circumstances of Covid-19,/uni00A0the ECB recommended temporary suspension of all cash dividends and share buy-backs in/uni00A0March/uni00A02020. The/uni00A0revised ECB recommendation of/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 expects banks to exercise extreme prudence with regard to dividends and share buy-backs until 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02021. In/uni00A0addition, ECB extended its expectation to banks to adopt extreme moderation with regard to variable remuneration until 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02021. A similar position has been taken by the EBA, EIOPA, and ESRB in order to safeguard banks'\n\ncapacity to absorb losses and lend to support the economy. For/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO's actions to reflect the supervisors' recommendations on this topic, please refer to Capital in/uni00A0the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\n## SREP and ECB/DNB supervision\n\nThe ECB postponed verification of compliance with the qualitative Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) measures by six months. Instead, the ECB/DNB supervision of ABN/uni00A0AMRO focused increasingly on sound credit risk management regarding the credit quality in the portfolios (e.g. which sectors, subsectors and clients are more vulnerable), the expected impact of the payment holiday measures and banks' operational capacity.\n\n## ECB Targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs)\n\nTLTROs are one of the ECB's non-standard monetary policy tools. The ECB/uni00A0uses TLTROs to/uni00A0provide long-term loans to banks and offer them an incentive to increase their lending to businesses and consumers in the euro area. The third TLTRO programme (TLTRO III) consists of a series of seven TLTROs, each with a maturity of three years, starting in September 2019 at a quarterly frequency. On 30 April 2020, the ECB decided to modify some of the terms and conditions of TLTRO III in order to support the economy in the face of Covid-19. In 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO made use of the TLTRO III programme. For additional information, please refer to Funding and Liquidity risk in the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\n## Sustainable Finance\n\nThe development of Sustainable Finance regulations received considerable attention over the past year. New regulations were published, existing regulations were amended and various supervisors and regulators included sustainable finance in their workplans.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation, adopted by the European Parliament in/uni00A0June/uni00A02020, establishes the criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable. The regulation is an essential step of the EU Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth in the efforts to channel investments into sustainable activities.\n\n## ECB guide on climate-related and environmental risks\n\nThe guide on climate-related and environmental risks explains how the ECB expects banks to consider climaterelated and environmental risks when formulating and implementing in their business strategy, governance and\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction by the CEO\n\nKey figures and profile\n\nABN AMRO shares\n\nEconomic environment\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ECB will use the expectations set out in the guide in its supervisory dialogue with significant banks as ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\n## Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)\n\nThe SFDR introduces various disclosure-related requirements for ABN/uni00A0AMRO at an entity, service and product level. The/uni00A0majority of the new disclosure obligations will take effect on 10/uni00A0March/uni00A02021. This regulation aims to create transparency on the integration of sustainability risks and how adverse sustainability impacts should be taken into account in investment processes, as well as on the provision of sustainability-related information on financial products. The disclosure requirements focus mainly on contractual and website disclosures, and on disclosures in/uni00A0periodic reports and marketing communications.\n\n## Developments regarding the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)\n\nThe NFRD lays down the rules on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by large companies such as ABN/uni00A0AMRO. A supplement to the NFRD on the reporting of/uni00A0climate-related information was published in 2019 as part of the EU Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth. Recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) also set out requirements on this topic. To be able to report on these matters in its Annual Report, ABN/uni00A0AMRO is robustly embedding climate into its/uni00A0strategy, business model, governance, policies, risk management and key performance indicators. In addition, the European Commission published a questionnaire on the NFRD in/uni00A0February/uni00A02020, and the resulting input will be used in the future revision of the NFRD.\n\n## Revised EBA Guidelines on internal governance and/uni00A0suitability\n\nIn/uni00A0July/uni00A02020, the EBA launched a public consultation to review its Guidelines on internal governance. At the same time, the EBA and ESMA launched a public consultation to revise their joint Guidelines on suitability. These will take into account the amendments introduced by the fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and the Investment Firms Directive (IFD) on credit institutions' sound and effective governance. These amendments mainly focus on i)/uni00A0mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risks, ii) mitigating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks, and iii) gender equality and diversity. ABN/uni00A0AMRO will integrate the revised Guidelines, which may be amended as a result of the current consultation and are expected to enter into force on 26/uni00A0June/uni00A02021, into its internal policies and processes.\n\n## Revised EBA Guidelines on sound remuneration/uni00A0policies\n\nIn/uni00A0October/uni00A02020, the European Banking Authority (EBA) launched a public consultation to review its Guidelines on sound remuneration policies. This review takes into account the amendments introduced by CRD V in relation to institutions' sound remuneration policies and in particular the requirement that those remuneration policies should be gender neutral. The consultation may lead to amendments of the currently published Revised Guidelines, which ABN/uni00A0AMRO will integrate into its policies and processes.\n\n## EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring\n\nAfter consultations in Q2 2019, the EBA published its Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring in/uni00A0May/uni00A02020. These Guidelines: i) specify internal governance arrangements for granting and monitoring credit facilities throughout their lifecycle; ii) clarify the credit decision-making process, including the use of automated models and building on the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance, and iii) set requirements for assessing borrowers' creditworthiness, along with requirements for handling information and data for such assessments. The/uni00A0requirements in the guidelines bring together the EBA's/uni00A0prudential and consumer protection objectives. The/uni00A0Guidelines will be integrated into ABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal policies and processes and apply from 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02021. However, various transitional arrangements are already in/uni00A0place.\n\n## EU Court ruling on data transfers in 'Schrems II'\n\nIn/uni00A0July/uni00A02020, the European Union Court of Justice ruled that/uni00A0certain legal grounds for the transfer of personal data outside Europe are invalid or require supplementary measures. As a result of this ruling, ABN/uni00A0AMRO needs to assess the risks and monitor more actively its data transfers outside Europe. Furthermore, ABN/uni00A0AMRO may need to take extra measures regarding non-EU vendors, or in some cases stop the data transfer.\n\n## Update on regulatory developments originating in/uni00A0previous years\n\n- H Anti-Money Laundering regulations: The Act implementing the fifth EU/uni00A0Anti-Money Laundering Directive/uni00A0(also referred to as AMLD5) entered into force in/uni00A0May/uni00A02020. In/uni00A0October/uni00A02020, the European Commission added new countries to the list of high-risk third countries 1 with strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes that/uni00A0pose significant threats to the EU financial system. These include Botswana, Cambodia, Ghana and Panama. The Dutch government has approved the Bill on the Action Plan for Combating Money Laundering (Wet plan van aanpak witwassen) and, after receiving advice from the Council of State, will introduce it in the House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer). Lastly, Transaction\n- 1 Countries that are not members of the European Union, and countries or territories whose citizens do not enjoy the European Union right to free movement (Schengen Treaty).\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction by the CEO Key figures and profile ABN AMRO shares Economic environment\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

For additional information, please refer to the Nonfinancial review in the Strategy & performance chapter.\n\n- H Banking reform package:/uni00A0 In order to implement the CRD V as part of the Banking Reform Package, the Ministry of Finance published consultations in 2020 on various implementing acts, degrees and ministerial regulations. The most comprehensive of these was the Implementation Act on Capital Requirements 2020 (Implementatiewet kapitaalvereisten 2020), implementing the amendments required in the Act on Financial Supervision (Wet op het financieel toezicht). Most articles of the Implementation Act entered into force on 29/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. After consultations in Q4 2019, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) published its 'Expectations for banks' in April 2020 regarding the amended Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD2). This document sets out the capabilities that the SRB expects banks to demonstrate in order to show that they are resolvable. For additional information, please refer to Capital in the Risk, capital & funding review section.\n- H Brexit: The UK left the EU on 31/uni00A0January/uni00A02020 and the transition period ended on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. The UK and EU have agreed a trade and cooperation agreement which (provisionally) entered/uni00A0into force on 1 January 2021. The agreement contains a free trade agreement, a partnership for citizens' security and a horizontal agreement on governance./uni00A0In addition, the UK and EU are seeking to agree a memorandum of understanding establishing a framework for regulatory cooperation regarding financial/uni00A0services by 31/uni00A0March/uni00A02021.\n- H Interbank offered rates (IBOR) reforms:/uni00A0 The reform of reference rates under the Benchmark Regulation (BMR) continues to take shape. In/uni00A0October/uni00A02019, the ECB began publishing its new overnight rate, \u20acSTR, which is/uni00A0being used alongside EONIA until the end of 2021, when EONIA will be discontinued. EURIBOR is BMR/uni00A0compliant following European Money Markets Institute       's  implementation  of  a  new  hybrid  methodology. Nevertheless, the Working Group on Euro Risk-Free Rates is recommending fallback trigger events and measures for EURIBOR-related products, which banks need to implement in their contracts. LIBOR is expected to be discontinued. As such, banks need to get ready to remove LIBOR from existing contracts and replace it with the recommended alternative risk-free rates. They should also use these new rates in their product offering. The EC has received powers to designate rates for contracts that cannot be amended in time. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is running a bank-wide project to implement IBOR reforms. For more information, please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n- H Finalisation of Basel III reforms (Basel IV): /uni00A0Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Basel Committee on Banking\n\n- Supervision announced that the implementation deadline for the Basel IV framework would be extended by one year to 1 January 2023.\n- H MiFID 2.5: MiFID II and MiFIR entered into force in January 2018. To review the regime, the European Commission will present a report on the operation of the new framework, presumably together with a legislative proposal for reform. A consultation was held between February and/uni00A0May/uni00A02020.\n- H TRIM: In/uni00A0December/uni00A02015, the ECB launched the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM), with a view to reducing/uni00A0unwarranted variability (i.e. variability not justified by different risk profiles) in capital requirements and ensuring/uni00A0consistent supervisory practices across the euro area. After conclusion of the on-site phase of TRIM in 2019, the ECB provided ABN/uni00A0AMRO with a final decision and two draft decisions in/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. All these TRIM decisions grant ABN/uni00A0AMRO permission to continue using its internal model approach and specific models for calculating own funds requirements for credit risk, subject to certain conditions. In parallel, the supervisory follow-up on TRIM findings will continue and the institutions will be expected to work intensively to address those findings. For more information on the impact of TRIM, please refer to the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n- H Definition of Default (DoD): To increase consistency across countries and banks, the ECB and EBA have adopted detailed new standards on how banks have to classify credit defaults for prudential purposes. The deadline for implementation was 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, with DoD-compliant reporting starting on 1 January 2021. ABN/uni00A0AMRO started applying the new definition of default pursuant to the DoD regulation in Q2 2020. For additional information, please refer to Credit risk management in the Risk, funding & capital management section.\n- H Ta x : The EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6) is aimed at achieving transparency and fairness in taxation. It sets out a reporting obligation for 'reportable cross-border arrangements' advised as of 25/uni00A0June/uni00A02018. The European Commission decided to postpone this reporting obligation's entry into force from 1/uni00A0July/uni00A02020 to 1 January 2021 owing to the difficulties faced by businesses and EU Member States as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Like many other EU Member States, the Netherlands has chosen to make use of this postponement option. Further amendments to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation include obligations for automatic exchange of information on income earned by sellers on digital platforms (DAC7), and a proposal to extend the scope of the Directive to include crypto assets and e-money (DAC8). These amendments demonstrate that tax transparency and exchange of information are continuously developing and/uni00A0will remain an important topic.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This guides us through changes, is the basis for how we shape and deliver on our strategy, and encourages high performance and engagement from our employees. Our purpose is our compass in everything we do. Our strategic pillars - customer experience, sustainability, and a future-proof bank - are our guiding principles in acting on our purpose.\n\nThroughout 2020, we continued with the execution of the strategy announced in 2018 and carried out an extensive strategy review to ensure we deliver on our three strategic pillars. We also constantly assessed the impact of Covid-19 on us and our clients, and the actions required to navigate through the crisis.\n\n## Customer experience\n\n2020 was a year marked by Covid-19. In line with our purpose, we supported our clients wherever possible, improving our digital services, introducing Covid-19 support measures, and developing new propositions to better meet our clients' needs.\n\nOur strong digital backbone enabled a transition to offpremise service within days of the Dutch government's announcement of the first lockdown on 12 March 2020. Throughout the year, we accelerated the roll-out of more intuitive video banking solutions, introducing improvements in our internet banking portal and digital channel optimisations such as live-chat, social platforms and our banking apps. This ensured that our clients were able to experience the same level of service remotely that they are accustomed to in person. Over 90% of our mortgage advice conversations are now conducted via video banking, with a consistently higher customer appreciation score than our traditional face-to-face on premise advice consultation. The/uni00A0relational Net Promotor Score results are included in the respective business segments in the Business\n\nPerformance section.\n\nOn top of the support measures offered by the Dutch government, we took action to help our clients through Covid-19, providing around 90,000 Retail and Commercial Banking clients with automatic deferral of interest and principal payments.\n\nAmid the urgency presented by Covid-19, we continued to develop new propositions beyond traditional financial services. For example, HROffice, our new recruitment service for SMEs, helps entrepreneurs in the SME sector to find suitable candidates for their vacancies. With another\n\nnew product, 'Snel Betaald', we offer entrepreneurs invoice financing through an online platform, where they can be paid within 24 hours after confirming the debtor.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe transition to sustainability is increasingly important to/uni00A0our clients. Sustainability has been core to our purpose, and/uni00A0one of our strategic pillars since 2018. We continued to help our clients make their sustainability transition in 2020, focusing on climate change, the circular transition and positive social impact. Our efforts were recognised again with a high score in S&P Global's SAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment, putting us in the top 10% of most sustainable banks worldwide. To reach our ambition of/uni00A0being among the top 5% of most sustainable banks, we/uni00A0have identified areas of improvement in, among others, risk reporting and crisis management.\n\nWithin Retail Banking, we continued to offer a sustainability discount on mortgages, integrated the sustainability of houses into our advisory reports and trained 94% of our mortgage advisors as 'Sustainable Living Advisors'. We/uni00A0also/uni00A0pushed forward on our target to improve the average energy label of our residential property portfolio to/uni00A0A-C/uni00A0label, reaching 62% by end of the year, just shy of our 63% target. While our target proved to be too ambitious for 2020, the inflow of A-labels (21%, representing a 7% increase compared to 2019) and the migrations from lower to higher energy labels have helped close the gap. In/uni00A0Private/uni00A0Banking, our clients' sustainable investments increased to EUR 26 billion during the year - well above our/uni00A0target of EUR 22.5 billion, supported by an increase in demand for sustainable contracts as well as our improved offering of funds. An important step toward global mitigation of climate change was also achieved this year, when the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), of which ABN AMRO is a co-founder, released a/uni00A0tool to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions linked to loans and investments. The PCAF standard is already used by 96 financial institutions worldwide.\n\nWe contribute to the circular economy through the advice and financing that we provide to businesses. We support circular business initiatives - such as the Saltrex auction platform, which finds new ways of using rejected or damaged goods, or Schijvens Corporate Fashion, which uses fully recycled materials to produce sustainable corporate clothing. These are two examples of circular deals we have financed as part of our ambition to support the move to a circular economy.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Positive social impact is about shaping the future together and about creating a fair and resilient society. We do our part by contributing to financial resilience, financial inclusion and equal opportunities. For example, as one of the largest sponsors of field hockey in the Netherlands, we launched the 'Time To Catch Up' programme, whereby every field hockey club that we sponsor must give equal treatment and equal roles to men and women in the sport.\n\n## Future-proof bank\n\nFor us, building a future-proof bank means creating an efficient organisation with strong capital ratios and financial performance, supported by talented and engaged employees and a rigorous implementation of regulatory requirements.\n\nOur employees are the foundation of the bank of the future. The continued commitment of our staff is clearly evidenced by our recent high employee engagement score of 84%, on/uni00A0target for 2020. While we still see a gap with gender diversity targets, we also note several improvements were achieved this year, ranging from gender neutral vacancy texts to the establishment of a diversity academy. To enable a future-proof bank, we have updated our data strategy with/uni00A0a strong focus on further enhancing and embedding our data management capabilities. In combination with our IT/uni00A0transformation programme, which will rejuvenate our IT/uni00A0landscape, our data strategy will further strengthen and simplify our organisation and enable personalised customer service.\n\nThe financial results for 2020 were marked by Covid-19, but/uni00A0were also impacted by large exceptional client files. The/uni00A0resulting return on equity (ROE) for 2020 was -0.8% and the cost/income ratio was 66%. Excluding CIB non-core, net profit for 2020 was EUR/uni00A01,140/uni00A0million, corresponding to an ROE of 5.4%. In order to re-establish our confirmed risk appetite, we have tightened risk standards, especially in CIB (including Clearing). Our capital position remained very strong, with a fully-loaded Basel III CET1 ratio of 17.7% and a Basel IV CET1 ratio above 15%.\n\nRisk management and compliance, including the fight against money laundering (AML), are key to our licence to operate. We are making progress in our AML remediation programmes and have significantly built up our capacity to/uni00A0address AML topics. In 2020, the number of FTEs committed to AML activities grew from around 2,000 to around 3,800 FTEs. Additionally, together with four other Dutch banks, we established the largely automated Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL) to facilitate the/uni00A0collective fight against financial crime. TMNL focuses on/uni00A0identifying unusual patterns in payments traffic in addition to our own transaction monitoring activities.\n\nPartnerships are essential in realising our strategy and offering the best value to our customer while remaining efficient and flexible. In 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO and ODDO BHF formed a strategic partnership to combine our equity brokerage services in Benelux. The partnership will enhance the equity capital markets, corporate broking and equity brokerage services to both corporate and institutional clients, creating a broader range of high-quality equity research of over 500 stocks and an extended distribution network of more than 600 institutional clients in Europe and/uni00A0the United States.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will be/uni00A0a/uni00A0personal bank in/uni00A0the digital age, serving clients where/uni00A0we have scale in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. Our/uni00A0strategic pillars/uni00A0- customer experience, sustainability and futureproof bank - remain our guiding principles in acting on our purpose 'Banking for better, for generations to come'.\n\nThe review also acknowledges our strong foundation. We/uni00A0are a leading Dutch bank with attractive market positions in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. We/uni00A0have longterm client relationships built on trust and supported by sector and sustainability expertise. Our trusted relationships with clients, together with our capabilities across all client segments, enable us to support them at all important financial steps in their lives. We deliver a convenient daily banking experience increasingly digitally. At moments that matter, we support our clients with sector and sustainability expertise. Our clients increasingly need expertise to support them in the sustainability shift and we are their first-choice partner in climate change, the circular economy\n\n1\n\n10.0%\n\nbanking sector\n\nTop 10% of\n\nbanking sector\n\nTop 10% of\n\nbanking sector\n\nFinancial\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "and social impact. We are building a future-proof bank by rigorously simplifying and centralising our operating model, enabling us to focus on clients and work more efficiently.\n\nWe target an ROE of around 8% by 2024 when the cost of/uni00A0risk is expected to have normalised, cost-savings programmes will be completed and growth initiatives will be delivering. We reconfirm our intention to resume payment of dividends, sustainably, conditions permitting and taking into account ECB recommendations. We are fully committed to our moderate risk profile and our role as a gatekeeper of/uni00A0the financial system. Our culture and licence to operate remain clear priorities.\n\n## The Corporate & Institutional Banking review\n\nThe wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio, as/uni00A0announced in August, was a/uni00A0first/uni00A0step to bring focused scale in CIB. In/uni00A0line with our vision and strategic principles, we concluded to be successful that our CIB activities needed more focus and scale and CIB will need to reduce risk to adhere to a/uni00A0moderate risk profile and will align to the bank's overall strategy and financial and non-financial ambitions. Hence, our focus will be on clients in Northwest Europe and Clearing, and we will exit all non-European corporate banking activities, except for Clearing.\n\nStricter lending criteria and credit limits have been set to contribute to a moderate risk profile. The non-core activities consist of all non-European corporate banking activities. Trade & Commodity Finance activities are being discontinued completely, and Natural Resources and Transportation & Logistics will focus on European clients only. We expect to complete the wind-down of these non-core activities in the next 3 to 4 years. This will affect around 800 FTEs. We are making good progress in winding down the CIB non-core business/uni00A0with loan volumes down by 45% since 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02020.\n\n## Customer experience: A personal bank in the digital/uni00A0age\n\nWe are a personal bank in the digital age, engraining the customer experience. Our trusted relationships, together with our capabilities across all client segments, allow us to/uni00A0support our clients at all important financial steps in their/uni00A0lives. We offer both convenience and expertise: a full digital/uni00A0self-service through end-to-end digitalisation for a convenient daily banking experience, and tailored solutions, based on sector-specific, financial and sustainability expertise enhanced with personal interaction at moments that matter.\n\nGoing forward, we will focus on attractive segments in the/uni00A0Netherlands and Northwest Europe. In the Netherlands, we will grow in the segments wealthy clients, affluent and high-income clients and mid-to-large corporates, where we leverage our expertise. We will further develop our leading\n\npositions in mortgages and SMEs with new propositions, aiming to achieve positive NPS scores and increase our market share to above 20% in both segments. In Northwest Europe, we build on our expertise in the Netherlands and will focus on the energy, mobility and digital transitions, aiming for a top 3 position in selected niches. We remain open to bolt-on acquisition opportunities, especially in private banking.\n\n## Sustainability: Core to our purpose\n\nSustainability has been a core element of our strategy since 2018, and is an important part of our purpose, 'Banking for better for generations to come'. We help our clients achieve their transition to more sustainable business models. In the Netherlands and Northwest Europe, we aim to be a first choice partner in sustainability for our clients.\n\nWe aim to integrate sustainability into all our businesses and to increase the volume of sustainable client loans and investments from around one-fifth now, to one-third by 2024. We will also lead by example.\n\n## Future-proof bank: Enabling client focus and efficiency\n\nWe are building a future-proof bank that is digital by design. We will significantly simplify and centralise our operating model, freeing up time for front office staff to engage with our clients. This means further digitising our business processes and further reducing our product offering: by 2024, we aim to have ~90% of high volume processes digitised end-to-end, and to achieve a ~60% reduction in the complexity of our product portfolio. As our clients make the shift to digital, we will continue to reduce the number of/uni00A0branch offices. Our financial coaches will, of course, continue to be available, ensuring that all our clients retain access to banking services. We expect a further ~15% reduction of staff by 2024, mostly from 2022 onwards. We/uni00A0will reduce the impact on our staff through natural attrition and reskilling to roles where we anticipate growth and want to/uni00A0prevent shortages.\n\n## Enhancing the bank's culture and compliance\n\nAs a value-driven organisation, our decisions and behaviour need to be in line with our purpose and strategy. We are fully committed to our moderate risk profile and our role as a gatekeeper of the financial system, which is why culture and licence to operate are clear priorities for us. We place great value on fostering a culture within the bank in which everyone feels respected and valued. Taking ownership, setting clear targets and being accountable are key to/uni00A0strategy execution and our license to operate. These/uni00A0are/uni00A0also essential for our commitment to deliver on our moderate risk profile and to continue our fight against money laundering.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

We/uni00A0create value, not only as a provider of financial services, but also as an employer and investor. Like any company, however, our activities may also have negative effects. For example, our actions may also increase carbon emissions and cause damage to the environment.\n\n## Our value-creating topics\n\nWe carry out an assessment of our operating environment every two years. This allows the bank to identify its most important value-creating topics (VCT) from various\n\nperspectives: social, economic, financial or environmental. This assessment is based on input from stakeholders. We distinguish four different groups of stakeholders: clients, employees, investors and society. Each group's input is asked and then weighted equally. The initial long list of VCTs is based on a review of internal and external sources, such as trend reports, peer analysis, ESG benchmarks, and Dutch media reports. This list is narrowed down to the 36 most important topics, based on their frequency of occurrence in the source documentation.\n\nDuring 2020, we repeated our materiality assessment of value-creating topics. In separate surveys, stakeholders and senior management were asked to prioritise the short-listed\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Out of the 36, we categorised nine separate VCTs as Strategic Differentiators where we believe we can create most value for our stakeholders and that differentiate us from our competitors. These differentiators impact the bank's strategy and its execution - /uni00A0each differentiator is tied/uni00A0to one of our three strategic pillars (see the following\n\ngraphic). Alongside these 9 differentiators, we call the remaining 27 VCTs Fundamental Value Creators - they are key to our ability to implement our strategy and help protect the bank's licence to operate.\n\nResults of the 2020 materiality assessment of valuecreating topics:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompared to the previous value-creating topics materiality assessment, the following VCTs, although they are still among our 36 most important VCTs, are no longer considered strategic differentiators: Co-creation & innovation, Ethics &/uni00A0integrity, Talent attraction and System stability. In their place, the 2020 list of strategic differentiators includes four new topics: Clear and appropriate advice, Diversity & equal opportunity, Risk profile / management and Financial performance.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nIn 2015, all United Nations Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a shared ambition for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and in the future. There are 17 integrated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the heart of this global partnership, with topics ranging from ending poverty and creating lifelong learning opportunities, to human rights and combating climate change.\n\nIn 2019, ABN/uni00A0AMRO signed the UN Principles for Responsible Banking, together with 129 other international banks. This connects the bank directly with the UN's 2030 agenda (Sustainable Development Goals). The signatories represent one-third of the total assets of all banks worldwide. By signing, ABN/uni00A0AMRO agrees to align the business strategy with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and with the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nABN AMRO assesses its impact mainly on three SDGs where the bank believes it makes most impact as a provider of financial services:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 8: Decent work and economic growth - 'Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.'\n\nSDG 12: Responsible production and consumption 'Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.'\n\nSDG 13: Climate action - 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.'\n\nThese focus SDGs also resonate with our strategic themes for sustainability: social impact, the circular economy and climate change.\n\nIn 2019, we carried out an initial baseline analysis to measure our contribution to these goals. Our 2020 assessment shows a positive impact on SDG 8 - largely through lending to businesses, thus supporting economic growth during the Covid-19 crisis. During 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO - in close cooperation with the Dutch government introduced a package of support measures for corporate\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective here is to reduce these negative impacts, where possible - largely by increasing financing for sustainable business.\n\n## Climate risks relevant for financial institutions\n\nClimate change provides both opportunities and risks for us. The main risks associated with climate change for a financial institution are transition risk and physical risk. The former emanates mainly from technological developments and changes in policies and consumer preferences, while the latter arises from the physical effects of climate change. At the same time, climate change provides opportunities for banks in the form of new investment possibilities and emerging business models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransition risks relate to revaluations of assets, firms and business models due to climate change. We are a recognised expert in sustainability and leverage this expertise to support our clients in their own sustainability transition. In this way, we contribute to the broader transition of the economy and also mitigate the transition risks we are facing.\n\nThe impact of physical risks on financial institutions is complex and difficult to estimate. In the course of 2020, we/uni00A0published our first efforts at estimating physical risks for/uni00A0specific sectors. The scenarios and models used are described in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital management section. The analyses that we carry out on this front are in place to inform strategic decision-making, and may help in deciding what portfolios to focus on.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This resulted in a one-off charge of EUR/uni00A080/uni00A0million, recorded in net interest income at ALM in Group Functions.\n\n## Positive revaluation DSB claim\n\n2020 included a positive revaluation of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A023/uni00A0million/uni00A0for/uni00A0a DSB claim, recorded in net interest income at Group Functions. 2019 included EUR/uni00A045/uni00A0million for positive one-offs, largely relating to DSB.\n\n## Sale and leaseback office Paris\n\nIn 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO concluded the sale and lease-back transaction of the Neuflize OBC/uni00A0office building in Paris. The book gain before tax amounted to EUR/uni00A0263/uni00A0million (EUR/uni00A0181/uni00A0million net of tax) and was recognised in other operating income at Private Banking.\n\n## CIB non-core wind-down\n\n2020 included a total of EUR/uni00A0160/uni00A0million for one-off costs relating to the wind-down of/uni00A0the CIB non-core portfolio, of which EUR/uni00A0103/uni00A0million was recorded in personnel expenses and EUR/uni00A057/uni00A0million in other expenses. Furthermore, a EUR/uni00A0120/uni00A0million write-off for deferred tax assets was recorded in income tax expense.\n\n## Release for discretionary variable remuneration\n\nPersonnel expenses in 2020 included a EUR/uni00A022/uni00A0million release for discretionary variable remuneration at CIB.\n\n## Provision for outstanding holiday entitlements\n\n2020 included a provision of EUR/uni00A017/uni00A0million in personnel expenses at Group Functions for outstanding holiday entitlements as employees took fewer holidays due to Covid-19.\n\n## Release relating to tax deductibility of AT1 coupon payments\n\nIn 2020, following a Dutch court ruling regarding the tax deductibility of AT1 coupon payments, a release of EUR/uni00A055/uni00A0million was recorded in tax to reflect the tax relief on AT1/uni00A0coupon payments in 2019 and 2020.\n\n## Provision for AML programme\n\nOther expenses in 2020 included EUR/uni00A044/uni00A0million in additions to the provision for AML remediation programmes (largely recorded at Group Functions). In 2019, a total of EUR/uni00A0174/uni00A0million was added to the provision (largely recorded at Retail Banking). Cumulative provisions taken for AML remediation programmes amount to EUR/uni00A0303/uni00A0million.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\n## Bank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Goodwill impairment at Private Banking Belgium\n\nOther expenses in 2020 included a EUR/uni00A034/uni00A0million goodwill and intangible impairment at/uni00A0Private Banking Belgium.\n\n## Provision for SME derivates-related issues\n\n2020 included a EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0million release for the provision regarding client compensation for SME derivatives-related issues, recorded in other operating income (at CIB), while 2019 showed a charge of EUR/uni00A034/uni00A0million. Furthermore, 2019 included a EUR/uni00A023/uni00A0million provision charge for project costs relating to SME derivatives-related issues, recorded in/uni00A0other expenses (at/uni00A0CIB).\n\n## Analysis\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO recorded a modest loss of EUR/uni00A045/uni00A0million in 2020, while 2019 recorded a profit of EUR/uni00A02,046/uni00A0million. The decrease was largely due to significant impairments (EUR/uni00A02,303/uni00A0million versus EUR/uni00A0657/uni00A0million in 2019), mainly reflecting the economic impact of Covid-19, oil price developments, and three exceptional client files.\n\nReturn on Equity for 2020 was 0.8% negative, compared with 10.0% in 2019, mainly as a result of record high impairments and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest income.\n\nReturn on Assets was 0.04% negative in 2020 (2019: 0.49%), due to higher assets and lower returns in 2020.\n\nNet interest income /uni00A0was EUR/uni00A05,863/uni00A0million, compared with EUR/uni00A06,468/uni00A0million in 2019. Excluding incidentals and divestments, net interest income declined mainly as a result of continued pressure on deposit margins in a low interest rate environment and lower average corporate loan/uni00A0volumes due to the ongoing wind-down of the CIB/uni00A0non-core portfolio.\n\nNet fee and commission income/uni00A0 amounted to EUR/uni00A01,558/uni00A0million, a decrease of EUR/uni00A074/uni00A0million compared with/uni00A02019. Excluding divestments (mainly Stater), the decrease in net fee and commission income was largely attributable to lower credit card usage at ICS (Retail Banking) due to Covid-19, and the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio, which was partly offset by higher income at Clearing (CIB) as market volatility was higher in 2020.\n\nOther operating income/uni00A0 remained broadly stable, totalling EUR/uni00A0494/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0504/uni00A0million). 2020 included a EUR/uni00A0263/uni00A0million book gain for the sale of our Paris office and a EUR/uni00A096/uni00A0million decline in income from volatile items, while 2019 included a EUR/uni00A0130/uni00A0million book gain for the sale of Stater.\n\n## Divestments\n\nIn 2019, ABN/uni00A0AMRO sold 75% of its Stater shares to Infosys, resulting in a EUR/uni00A0130/uni00A0million book gain (tax exempt), recorded in other operating income at/uni00A0Group/uni00A0Functions.\n\n## Collective labour agreement (CLA)\n\n2019 included a one-off payment of EUR/uni00A030/uni00A0million to the pension fund, recorded in personnel expenses, as agreed under the collective labour agreement for 2020-2021.\n\nPersonnel expenses , excluding incidentals and divestments (mainly Stater), remained broadly flat, totalling EUR/uni00A02,280/uni00A0million in 2020. This included lower pension costs (as agreed in the new CLA) and higher costs due to/uni00A0the upscaling of AML activities and wage inflation.\n\nOther expenses , excluding incidentals, increased by EUR/uni00A010/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A02,976/uni00A0million in 2020, largely due to/uni00A0higher regulatory levies. Costs for the upscaling of AML activities were largely offset by cost-saving programmes.\n\nImpairment charges/uni00A0 were significant in 2020, totalling EUR/uni00A02,303/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A0657/uni00A0million), mainly reflecting the economic impact of Covid-19, oil price developments, and three exceptional client files. The full-year impairment charges were lower than guidance provided during 2020, largely because the CIB non-core portfolio performed better, and was reduced faster than expected. We still expect the effect of Covid-19 to persist into 2021. The cost of risk amounted to 78bps in 2020 (2019: 24bps).\n\nIncome tax expense /uni00A0amounted to EUR/uni00A0401/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0634/uni00A0million). The decrease is attributable to the result for 2020 being lower than the result for 2019. However, the effective tax rate increased significantly due to an unfavourable geographical mix of pre-tax income and pre-tax losses, as well as the fact that no full tax benefit was recognised on the provision for the CIB non-core wind-down, since deferred tax assets could not be recognised on losses incurred in specific tax jurisdictions. Furthermore, 2020 included a EUR/uni00A0120/uni00A0million write-off of deferred tax assets relating to the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\n## Bank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2020, ABN AMRO changed its presentation of instant payment facilities. For more information, please refer to Note 12 Cash and balances at/uni00A0central banks in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nLoans and advances customers decreased by EUR/uni00A015.4/uni00A0billion, totalling EUR 252.2 billion at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. The decline was largely attributable to/uni00A0a/uni00A0decline in client loans, while loans to professional counterparties remained broadly stable. During 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO changed its presentation of instant payment facilities. For more information, please refer to Note 20 Loans and advances customers in the Consolidated Annual/uni00A0Financial Statements.\n\nClient loans declined by EUR/uni00A014.8 billion to EUR/uni00A0235.5/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. The decrease mainly reflected a decline in corporate loans at CIB, which was largely attributable to the ongoing wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio. Furthermore, there was a slight decrease in residential mortgages, mainly as a result of higher mortgage redemptions, and in corporate loans at Commercial Banking, mainly due to lower demand/uni00A0as an effect of Covid-19.\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

We recognise that in the areas of climate governance, incorporating climate factors into our strategic process and setting actionable climate targets, we still have work to do. Other areas, such as risk management, are expected to further evolve in the coming years as the field of climate risk rapidly matures.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is currently in the process of further implementing the NFRD 2019 climate guidelines and TCFD framework in the organisation. A bank-wide programme has been started to improve these disclosures and bring them more in line with the guidelines. The ECB guide on climate-related and environmental risks is included in this programme too.\n\n## Crime and integrity\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of our role as a gatekeeper in safeguarding the financial system against financial crime. We seek to continually improve our policies, procedures, systems and controls; to live up to our regulatory obligations and societal expectations; to minimise the risk of being involved in or associated with money laundering, the financing of terrorism, corruption or tax evasion, and to comply with internationally agreed economic sanctions.\n\nIn/uni00A0September/uni00A02019, the Dutch public prosecutor informed ABN/uni00A0AMRO that it is the subject of an investigation relating to requirements under the Dutch Act on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (in Dutch: Wwft ). The scope of the investigation includes whether the bank has complied with the Wwft in relation to having client files in good order, timely reporting of unusual transactions\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\n## Bank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, the financial impact of a potential fine, if any, cannot be reliably estimated as yet. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is cooperating fully.\n\n## Clients and third-party integrity\n\nBefore entering into and during business relationships, ABN/uni00A0AMRO carries out due diligence on its clients and third parties such as agents, intermediaries and suppliers. We do this using a risk-based approach, aimed at minimising the risk of being involved in or associated with money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption or tax evasion.\n\nWe systematically monitor the activities of our clients and/uni00A0report any suspicious or unusual transactions to the relevant authorities. Prospective and existing clients in high-risk situations (such as those involving politically exposed persons, adverse media, or clients in countries or/uni00A0sectors with an inherently higher risk of financial crime) undergo additional due diligence. We also consider geopolitical factors when assessing the risks of financial crime in relation to specific countries or sectors. Unacceptable risks lead to the prospective client or third party in question being rejected or, in the case of an existing client, to an exit.\n\nIn 2020, we continued executing our AML remediation programmes throughout the bank. Our activities designed to strengthen the foundations and remediate gaps have been reviewed by an independent expert and the plan has been shared with the regulator. At present, more than 3,800 employees are fully dedicated to AML activities. We/uni00A0are taking all remedial actions necessary to ensure full/uni00A0compliance with legislation, while remaining fully committed to complying with all current and future antimoney laundering and terrorist financing legislation and/uni00A0making the required investments.\n\n## Organisational and employee integrity\n\nAll our staff members undergo pre-employment screening, and integrity-sensitive positions require additional screening. The Code of Conduct sets out guidance for handling day-today business decisions, as well as major dilemmas. All staff members also participate in mandatory training aimed at learning how to recognise signs of financial crime, including 'red flags' of money laundering, corruption, fraud and conflicts of interest. We have policies in place that require employees to immediately report all actual or suspected incidents, irregularities and breaches relating to bribery or corruption. We encourage employees to speak up if they become aware of risks or behaviour that are not in line with ABN/uni00A0AMRO's purpose, cultural principles and strategy and, where possible, to first discuss such suspicions with their manager. If this is undesirable for any reason, they should report their suspicions through the bank's whistleblowing channels, which are also open to external parties.\n\n## Combating bribery and corruption\n\nCorruption undermines fair and competitive business, restricts international trade, reduces investor confidence, and impacts on regional and global economic growth and international stability. In addition to the risks that corruption poses to the financial system, ABN/uni00A0AMRO itself can also face reputational and financial risks from potentially becoming directly exposed to or being abused for corrupt practices. We take these risks seriously and take mitigating measures  aimed  at  limiting  them.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, we monitor the risks of money laundering, terrorism financing, bribery and corruption in our organisation so as to maintain a strong control system and to mitigate risks. These risks are assessed as part of our Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA), which is based on qualitative and quantitative information and helps us to gain insight into the inherent and residual risks we face, as well as ensure we operate within the bank's risk appetite. In addition to the SIRA, ABN/uni00A0AMRO continually strives to obtain data-driven insight into integrity risks. It is our corporate social responsibility to conduct business with integrity and without any form of bribery or corruption. More information about ABN/uni00A0AMRO's stance on corruption can be found in our anti-bribery and corruption policy. This key compliance document is available on  our  website.\n\n## Resilience to security threats\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's information infrastructures connect the bank's networks to public networks. As a result, banking processes and their supporting information systems are/uni00A0inherently vulnerable, threatening the/uni00A0security and availability of client data and services. We have established a structured information security framework to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and its associated assets at all times. This framework defines the organisational structure, management and staff responsibilities, and sets out security directives applying to the bank, its vendors and third parties. The Corporate Information Security Office (CISO) strives to ensure the security of the bank, our clients and society by, among other things, systematically monitoring client transactions in order to detect fraudulent transactions. Security & Integrity Management (SIM) monitors and reports the number of incidents/uni00A0detected and the trends related to fraud, information security and/uni00A0compliance breaches, while also monitoring losses suffered by the bank's clients and the bank itself.\n\nIn addition, various departments in ABN/uni00A0AMRO work closely together in virtual teams to manage and prevent the risk of fraud, financial crime and unethical behaviour. In order to prevent abuse of client data or violations of privacy, for instance, we implemented a programme in 2020 to detect any cases of staff accessing client accounts without a valid business reason. The bank also faces a constant\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "threat of cybercrime. As part of its security programme, therefore, it continuously monitors cybercrime threats and adapts the bank's defences wherever necessary. The closure of ATMs at night resulted in a decrease in the number of attacks on ATMs in 2020. However, we subsequently observed an increase in the number of attacks on seal bag machines. ABN/uni00A0AMRO, ING and Rabobank therefore decided to also close seal bag machines at night.\n\nThe bank is keen to raise awareness among clients and employees on how to recognise and prevent financial crime. We also collaborate/uni00A0with other banks, the Financial Intelligence Unit, the/uni00A0Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD) and the Dutch police in various public-private partnerships/uni00A0to counter various forms of crime, including organised crime, terrorist financing and cybercrime.\n\n## Responsible tax/uni00A0\n\nTax is an integral part of our sustainability agenda; it is our corporate social responsibility to pay our share/uni00A0of/uni00A0taxes. We communicate about our tax policy transparently/uni00A0and publish our tax principles on our website. Our tax principles illustrate how/uni00A0we/uni00A0fulfil our/uni00A0social responsibility in this area. Our/uni00A0tax policy is based/uni00A0on these principles and provides guidance on what/uni00A0we believe is responsible tax/uni00A0behaviour for ABN/uni00A0AMRO, both regarding our own affairs and in our dealings with clients. Our tax policy has been approved by the Executive Committee, and tax and tax risk management are discussed in the Audit Committee.\n\n## Tax  transparency\n\nOur tax principles and tax policy, as well as our aim to be a/uni00A0good/uni00A0corporate citizen, support our objective to pay our share of taxes. Measures on increased transparency and accompanying reporting obligations have been implemented into national law, and therefore also affect ABN/uni00A0AMRO./uni00A0We report taxable income in each country we/uni00A0operate in, and in line with the value created in/uni00A0that specific country. We also file a country-by-country report to the Dutch tax authorities. The country-by-country report in Note 10 of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements shows our revenue and tax expenses for each/uni00A0country. We/uni00A0are transparent about our tax position, and transparency is embedded in our values and standards.\n\nWe also comply with transparency rules with respect to our clients. There are increasing legal obligations to exchange information on our clients, of which the European Common Reporting Standard CRS and the American Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA) are well-known examples. Under these reporting obligations, information on our clients is exchanged with the tax autorities.\n\nThis year, we executed a programme to implement the requirements imposed by the EU Directive on Mandatory Disclosure Rules (DAC6). These requirements relate to\n\narrangements that may fall within certain hallmarks indicating involvement in potentially aggressive crossborder tax arrangements entered into by ABN/uni00A0AMRO itself or its clients. These have to be reported to the local tax authorities, with the aim of preventing tax avoidance. We have made the necessary preparations to fulfil the DAC6 reporting obligations as at 1 January 2021.\n\n## Digitalisation of tax\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is increasingly required to exchange information with tax authorities, based on domestic and international regulations. These rules will extend in the coming years from (corporate) income taxes also to VAT. Moreover we expect increasing requirements for automated tax filing via full data lineage including an automated audit trail from source system to tax return, such as the Making Tax Digital requirements in the UK.\n\n## Client tax integrity\n\nClient tax integrity norms are based on our organisation's values and tax risk appetite. Our moderate tax risk appetite is part of the bank-wide appetite for a moderate risk profile, which is an integral part of our corporate strategy. The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) has continued to increase its focus on client tax integrity risks. This resulted in the publication in 2019 of the DNB Good Practices on Client Tax Integrity, providing guidance on how to structure internal processes so as to identify and manage risks associated with tax integrity of clients. In 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO continued to focus on client tax integrity as wells as to ensure that our policies and tax principles are aligned and clear on this issue, and we will continue to do so going forward. ABN/uni00A0AMRO supports tax awareness sessions for clientfacing staff so as to ensure they remain continuously aware of client tax integrity risks in the context of the evolving international tax landscape.\n\nLastly, and as we wish to steer clear of aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance, we want to offer products that comply with the intention and spirit of the law and that are commercially rather than tax-driven. This approach is also reflected in our tax principles and tax policy, and embedded in our product approval process.\n\n## Tax risk management\n\nIn/uni00A02020, we implemented further measures to enhance our tax risk management. Our Tax Control Framework is subject to ongoing enhancement so that changes in regulations and stakeholders' interests can be promptly implemented whenever necessary. Tax risk is part of the bank's risk management cycle.\n\nTax integrity is part and parcel of our strategic integrity risk assessment, which supports our risk-based approach to tax integrity risks. Consideration of tax risks is also mandatory when preparing a risk assessment for a product or business.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\n## Bank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "A company-wide control was implemented in 2020 to ensure adherence to the tax policy throughout ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nControls are in place and included in our Tax Control Framework to ensure that ABN/uni00A0AMRO files tax returns in good time in all the jurisdictions where we are required to do so and that tax risks and positions are promptly identified and reported./uni00A0We are pro-actively seeking cooperation with the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions to align our tax obligations.\n\n## Our people\n\nTo live up to our purpose and achieve our strategic goals, we need to have the right talent on board and to be able to unleash the potential of our people. Being a people-centric bank, ABN/uni00A0AMRO continually invests in: 1) the people experience, 2) strategic workforce management, 3) culture and leadership development, and 4) diversity and inclusion.\n\n## People experience\n\nPeople are our most valuable asset. We need engaged people in order to give our clients the best possible service and to ensure we achieve our strategic ambitions. Our/uni00A0Employee Engagement Survey (EES), conducted in/uni00A0September/uni00A02020, had a 76% employee participation rate. Our Engagement Index increased to 84, which is above our target of 80. Our Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) measures the extent to which colleagues promote ABN/uni00A0AMRO as an employer to friends and family. This score increased from -7.95 in 2019 to +6.35 in 2020, indicating that more people now feel they are brand ambassadors of ABN/uni00A0AMRO as an employer. In these difficult Covid-19 times, we have endeavoured to support people as much as we can and to offer them the best possible experience in order to be an employer of choice, both now and in the future. We are proud, therefore, to see that our employee engagement and experience scores have improved, even during these challenging times in which many employees have had to work from home. Going forward, and learning from the current Covid-19 situation, working at ABN/uni00A0AMRO means even greater autonomy and freedom in how, where and when our people perform their work. This will enable them to achieve a healthier work-life balance by being encouraged to focus on the job at hand, irrespective of the time and place.\n\n## Strategic Workforce Management\n\nThe nature of work is changing rapidly and on a large scale. This creates opportunities, but also risks and challenges. New jobs arise, existing ones disappear and others cannot yet even be conceived of. Strategic Workforce Management techniques provide insight into the current and future workforce and the critical skills that we need if we are to remain relevant for our clients and achieve our strategic ambitions.\n\n## Reskilling and upskilling\n\nThe critical skills that we need to have, both now and in the future, include skills in areas such as data and digital, learning agility, and risk and compliance awareness, but also in design and service design expertise. We therefore determine where we have skills gaps and invest in what is/uni00A0necessary to close these gaps. This means not only investing in training, but also in reskilling and upskilling as/uni00A0part of every employee's day-to-day routine.\n\n## Talent development\n\nWe continually invest in our people through coaching, on-the-job learning, formal training (classroom and e-learning) and mandatory courses. In this way, we enable them to develop their knowledge and skills so as to support them in securing long-term employability and contributing to the execution of our strategy. We develop their sustainability knowledge and skills at our CIRCL Academy and structurally invest in people development journeys through our Personalised Academy Platform. Trained skills represent the awareness of the future social, economic and environmental impact of decisions taken today. They also increase people's ability to integrate sustainability into business strategies dynamically and effectively by introducing innovative applications and transforming these into business/uni00A0assets. Our people are supported in their personal and professional development by ongoing dialogues with their team and coach or manager in our modern performance management process ('Together & Better'). Lastly, we use our EES to measure the extent to which they appreciate the bank's talent and development opportunities. In 2020, their overall satisfaction with talent and development was found to be 80% positive, an improvement of 1 percent point compared to 2019.\n\n## Talent attraction\n\nIf we cannot develop critical skills within our organisation, we have to find and attract people with these capabilities from outside the organisation. This means continually investing in being an employer of choice. We hired some 2,200 talented new employees in 2020. We were able to do so thanks to concerted employer branding efforts, including our sponsorship of The Next Web (Europe's biggest tech platform), digital branding campaigns (the Darkside of Money film on detecting financial crime and various IT podcasts) and several talent programmes. We also focused on skill-based recruitment and talent-pooling and on ensuring an engaging onboarding process. These activities combined to achieve a reduction in the lead time in our processes, a higher quality of inflow, a better balance in diversity and an improvement in the employee experience, all with the ultimate aim of encouraging people to act as ambassadors of our bank.\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Culture and Leadership Development\n\nIn 2020, we continued along the path we set out in 2019 for engaging to achieve ABN/uni00A0AMRO's purpose and strategy.\n\nWe believe that creating the right culture, where people feel free and safe to speak up, give voice to their values and discuss dilemmas, as well as developing inclusive, collaborative and effective leaders, is crucial for creating the people experience we want to offer. The need for this was emphasised very clearly in 2020 by the sudden switch to remote working that was required as a result of the Covid-19 measures. Our efforts included developing and making available a wide variety of tools, training and tips to support and encourage leaders and teams to stay healthy, committed and productive, and to speak up.\n\nWe also continued the quarterly leadership get-togethers and regular leadership conversations, bringing together ABN/uni00A0AMRO's senior and executive managers. These meetings focused on providing and sharing insights on how the bank is helping clients and people navigate the Covid-19 crisis and what the role of leadership can and should be.\n\nAs well as bringing the Leading for Better Leadership programme completely online, we launched our Leading with Impact programme. The latter, which builds on the Leading for/uni00A0Better Leadership programme for ABN/uni00A0AMRO's most senior leaders, is accessible to leaders and prospective leaders with/uni00A0a minimum of two years' experience in such a/uni00A0role. Its/uni00A0curriculum is tuned to promoting cross-business collaboration, building relevant leadership skills and working on translating strategic work challenges into operational practice. By partnering with various external parties in these leadership programmes, we ensure we bring in plenty of outside-in views and thought leadership. As part of our global/uni00A0Speak Up programme, leaders are educated on ethical leadership and trained in how to create an environment that is free from barriers to do good and to do the right things right.\n\nIn 2020, we made substantial progress in our succession management process by taking the next steps to make sure we have the right people in the right place at the right time. We are also looking to ensure we have enough talented people in-house to safeguard business continuity by gaining more insight into our talent pipeline and becoming better able to identify talent and unique successors deeper in the organisation.\n\n## Diversity  and  inclusion\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO views a diverse and inclusive workforce as being of paramount importance. This enables our people to perform optimally, yields winning ideas and initiatives, and places us at the centre of society. For many years we have been seeking to become an increasingly diverse and\n\ninclusive organisation. The various initiatives taken in this respect in 2020 included launching external and internal mentoring programmes for women and for employees with a bicultural background. We also held inclusion campaigns during Pride Week in Amsterdam and Rotterdam and, in October, over 6,500 of our employees participated in a total of 55 workshops during the Diversity and Inclusion Week.\n\nTo increase the impact of diversity and inclusion, both internally and externally, we have developed an integrated and innovative strategy in collaboration with our stakeholders. As part of this strategy, we conducted more than 40 interviews in 2020 and held various workshops with colleagues from relevant departments, with the close involvement of the Works Council.\n\nIn March, we signed the UN Women's Empowerment Principles to mark our commitment to structurally integrating the gender lens into our business strategy. In/uni00A0that context, we also carried out pay gap research and launched the Women and Assets (V rouwen en Vermogen) campaign, as well as an equal opportunities programme for/uni00A0field hockey.\n\nResults to date show that the bank currently employs 116/uni00A0colleagues with a disability, which means we have more than achieved our target for 2020. Given that 41% of our ExCo1 members are women, we have achieved our target of/uni00A0having women in 30% of senior management positions. However, we are behind on our 2020 gender targets, currently 28% for middle-management positions (target: 35%), and our cultural targets, currently 3.9% for senior management positions (target: 6%). We will therefore further intensify our/uni00A0efforts to achieve these objectives over/uni00A0the coming year by rolling out 50/50 gender-balanced inflow throughout the organisation, arranging bias awareness training for all managers and posting inclusively voiced job advertisements.\n\nDespite these challenges, our efforts were rewarded over the past year in the form of the Diversity in Business Award, the Reuters D&I Leader Award (Highly Commended) and the Ambassador Award for the Best Workplace Pride Benchmark. The EES also showed 91% of our people experience the bank as an inclusive environment.\n\n## Human rights\n\nFor ABN/uni00A0AMRO, respecting human rights is part of responsible business practice. Through our products and services, we directly or indirectly have an impact/uni00A0on the lives of/uni00A0millions of people. We recognise that, in all our roles, human rights are at risk and that we have to actively perform human rights due diligence.\n\n- 1 This is the definition of salient human rights issues set out in the UN Guiding Principles (UNGP) Reporting Framework. We report on human rights in line with this framework.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\n## Bank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, we decided to carry out a new salience assessment, incorporating all the insights gained\n\nsince 2015. This new assessment provides the basis for our 2020 Human Rights Report. /uni00A0 The process and outcomes of this latest assessment were endorsed at the Sustainability Advisory Committee meeting on 12/uni00A0October/uni00A02020.

Our management of each salient issue is discussed in the 2020 Human Rights Report, which has been compiled in accordance with the UNGP Reporting Framework. We have used this report and the framework to identify gaps in our management of the salient issues that need to be addressed in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, we will use the Risk Register to track our progress not only on the salient issues, but also on other human right risks identified during the assessment.\n\n## Our  main  areas  of  progress  in  2020\n\nIn 2020, we updated our Human Rights Statement. This statement is based on/uni00A0international guidelines and conventions, including the/uni00A0OECD guidelines and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It defines how we understand our responsibility to respect human rights in the business we do, and also what we expect of our clients and business partners. The 2020 statement includes an elaboration on remedial action and the importance of human rights defenders and civic space. As part of our human rights programme in 2020, we also tested a potential grievance procedure, designed to provide\n\nremedy for people who have been harmed by our corporate clients. The aim of this project was to identify the practical challenges and implications of such a mechanism, to test certain options, and to gather feedback from internal stakeholders who may be involved in such a mechanism.\n\nOur conversations with stakeholders, such as civil society organisations and clients, continued throughout 2020. Through dialogue and the exchange of information we are learning about the ways in which people's human rights have or could have been affected, and about our potential involvement. In the summer of 2020, our CEO Robert Swaak had several meetings with civil society organisations to discuss topics including human rights and ABN/uni00A0AMRO's activities, our level of transparency in this area and our approach towards engaging with clients.\n\n## Our material topics\n\nAs disclosed in the Strategy section, ABN/uni00A0AMRO performed a new materiality assessment, which was concluded in/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. However, given that the 2018 assessment was still in use during the year 2020, the 2018 materiality matrix is presented below.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\n## Bank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Retail Banking\n\n## Business description\n\nRetail Banking provides a full range of transparent banking products and high-quality services to individuals with investable assets up to EUR/uni00A0500,000. We offer our products and services under the ABN/uni00A0AMRO brand, and specific products and services under other labels. Our clients have access to a seamless omni-channel distribution network providing a top-class digital and remote offering, and supported by a nationwide network of 112 branches and our Contact Centre.\n\nRetail Banking has a strong and recognised market position in the Netherlands. In 2020, we maintained our number three primary bank position for retail clients (19% 1/uni00A0 of the Dutch population). ABN/uni00A0AMRO captured a number two market position in new mortgage production in 2020, the/uni00A0combined market share of all ABN/uni00A0AMRO brands in the/uni00A0Dutch mortgage market was 15%.\n\n## Business developments Introduction\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus has had an immediate impact on the financial situation of many of our clients. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has therefore introduced several support measures to help clients survive this crisis as healthily as possible. The action we have taken has included granting temporary relief to mortgage clients facing payment problems. Less than 1% of mortgage clients made use of these payment holidays, while around 98% of these clients restarted regular payments after six months.\n\nThe continued low interest rates have also increased the pressure on Retail Banking's/uni00A0traditional earning model. In/uni00A0response, we lowered the threshold for negative interest to EUR/uni00A0500,000 per client, while the interest on deposits below EUR/uni00A0500,000 euros remained unchanged at 0%. In addition, ABN/uni00A0AMRO decided to discontinue the Moneyou activities in the Netherlands and Germany, except for Moneyou's mortgage activities. This was because the low interest rate environment prevented Moneyou from differentiating itself in the market, while the bank as a whole has a liquidity surplus.\n\nAs part of the strategy review, Retail Banking is focusing on/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO's ambition to be a personal bank in the digital age. Combining convenience and expertise is a key differentiator in this respect. We provide expertise when it/uni00A0matters through video banking combined with personal interaction, with the aim of growing our client base and market share primarily in affluent client segments. We are\n\ntargeting these clients/uni00A0with an improved investment offering so as to grow income beyond savings. In addition we will be broadening our intermediary offering so as to increase our mortgage production./uni00A0\n\n## Customer experience\n\nClient centricity is at the heart of our strategy. Ongoing digital and innovative developments require us to continually adjust and improve our services to meet changing client expectations. Our Net Promoter Score (NPS) is stabilising, with a score of -11 in 2020 (2019: -10). Our clients continue to remain positive about the remote and digital channels that are driving our shift to digital. Driven by the Covid-19 crisis, the use of video banking grew rapidly during the year, accounting for 86% of consultations with our advisors. Around 40% of our clients who used remote video banking rated their experience as 9+ on a 10-point scale. Mobile Banking, too, is highly appreciated, with 45% of our mobile banking users rating their experience 9+.\n\nThe bank's duty of care is an important driver for reinventing the customer experience. We reach out to our clients and respond to their needs. We offer products that are fit for purpose by improving our product approval & review process. We proactively challenge ourselves to think client-orientated, endorsed by culture & awareness programmes throughout the organisation.\n\nIn 2020, we reached a milestone by proactively reaching out/uni00A0to 100,000 clients with interest-only or investment mortgages. We have dedicated teams in place to inform these clients about their situation and to incentivise them to/uni00A0move towards product conditions that better fit their interests. Our clients highly appreciate these conversations, as evidenced by the strong NPS score at both ABN/uni00A0AMRO (24) and Florius (34).\n\nTo help clients manage their finances, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has added a subscription service to its Grip/uni00A0app so users can keep track of their subscriptions. This includes the option of cancelling subscriptions quickly and free of charge. Grip, our smart personal finance manager, is available for multi-bank clients and currently has around 620,000 users.\n\nOur efforts to improve our offering and services are appreciated: ABN/uni00A0AMRO's mortgage label Florius was recognised as the best Dutch mortgage provider in 2020, winning a Gouden Lotus as well as a Gouden Spreekbuis award. We have also redesigned the ABN/uni00A0AMRO\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Pensioncheck and automated the process flow to offer our clients easy and seamless insights into their pension situation.\n\n## Variable interest rate complaints for consumer loans\n\nThe alternative dispute resolution body Kifid has given rulings on contractual terms that give credit providers the unconditional right to change the variable interest rate of loans provided to consumers (revolving credit and mortgage loans). In short, Kifid ruled that if the contractual term does not specify the grounds for changing the interest rate, the customer may expect the only relevant circumstances that can play a role in changing the interest rate to be market developments. As a result, the difference between the contractual rate and the average market rate is set at the moment the contract is entered into. From then on, the contractual rate should follow movements of the average market rate. In order to establish whether the credit provider followed market developments, Kifid compares the course of the contractual interest rate with certain average interest rates published by Statistics Netherlands and the Dutch Central Bank. In the event of deviations, it could lead to a possible repayment of the difference by the credit provider.\n\nABN AMRO has received similar complaints from customers. In a 15 July 2020 ruling, the Kifid Disputes Committee ruled that ABN AMRO had to recalculate the variable interest charged to a specific customer on a revolving credit. This ruling was upheld in a 3 March 2021 ruling by the Kifid Appeals Committee. ABN AMRO does not agree with the current rulings of Kifid on this matter and therefore considers taking several complaints cases to the civil courts. ABN AMRO has made a provision because it considers it more likely than not that there will be outflow on the basis of individual similar Kifid rulings until new civil case law becomes available. For civil case law, ABN AMRO considers it not more likely than not that there will be outflow, reason why no provision has been accounted for.\n\nABN AMRO cannot give a reliable estimate of the (potentially substantial) total financial risk of the contingent liabilities not provided for, because it is unclear what the exact scope of the verdict is and whether the verdict will have a certain knock-on effect on other products.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe are supporting our clients in their transition to sustainability by setting concrete goals and taking decisive action. A large share of carbon emissions in the Netherlands are attributable to the use of natural gas to heat homes and to electricity. Our significant mortgage portfolio EUR/uni00A0146 billion therefore plays a vital role both in the risks associated with the physical impact of climate change (see: physical risk analysis in Sustainability risk in Risk, funding & capital review section) and in the opportunity to drive climate neutrality, as stated in our Mission 2030 ambition. We are\n\nalso actively collaborating with the sustainability expert HomeQgo to fully integrate its sustainability advice into our mortgage offering. We take a personal and step-by-step approach in discussions with clients about making their homes more sustainable. 94% of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's mortgage advisors were trained as Sustainable Living Advisors, meaning they have the expertise needed to discuss these step-by-step plans with their clients. In addition, we offer interest rate discounts for energy-efficient homes. Currently 21% of the overall portfolio comprises homes with an energy-efficiency label A, an improvement compared to last year (14%).\n\nWe also offer clients a range of sustainable propositions. Until recently, ABN/uni00A0AMRO Groenbank clients could open a green deposit account with Moneyou. Following the discontinuation of the Moneyou activities, ABN/uni00A0AMRO will start offering a new green deposit account through its own channels during 2021. Our Green Loans subsidiary is also helping clients to invest in home improvement measures that will generate or save energy. In 2020, Green Loans' outstanding loans increased by EUR/uni00A05.8/uni00A0million to a total of EUR/uni00A042.1/uni00A0million.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO also aspires to have more social impact and is committed to improving senior citizens' financial independence in a rapidly digitalising world. Our Contact Centre has therefore introduced the 'Senior Line' that offers these clients/uni00A0easy access to dedicated human expertise and support.\n\n## Future-proof bank\n\nWe are continuing to focus on digitalisation and rationalisation to build a future-proof bank. In 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO switched to a single basic payment package the BasisPakket Betalen/uni00A0- for all retail clients. This package includes a current account, bank card and access to online banking. Clients can buy additional payment products such as a credit card or a second bank card separately. In this way they have more flexibility to select payment products suiting their own needs and preferences.\n\nWe also aim to improve our mortgage offering by launching a price-competitive mortgage provider through our digital offering for target groups such as refinancers and starters, and by driving consistency and speed across our mid-office so as to remain a reliable partner.\n\nRetail Banking is well on track with our AML remediation programme. We are actively approaching our clients to provide us with missing data. Besides joining the antimoney laundering organisation Transaction Monitoring Netherlands, we are also working on a new client onboarding process to reduce the risk of money laundering. This new flow is now available in the ABN/uni00A0AMRO app./uni00A0\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Commercial Banking offers a broad range of products and services, based on in-depth client and sector knowledge combined with innovative value propositions and offerings and a digital approach for convenience banking products.\n\n## Business developments Introduction\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus had a direct impact on the/uni00A0financial situation of many of our clients. We therefore granted an automatic six-month deferral of interest and principal payments to clients with loans up to EUR 50 million, unless they actively opted-out from this support measure. Given the pandemic's huge impact on clients' operations, many clients were very pleased to be able to make use of/uni00A0this offer. In total, around 60,000 Commercial Banking clients were granted a deferral of interest and principal payments on business loans (including current accounts of/uni00A0which balances varied during the period). We also helped our clients navigate through the pandemic by offering additional liquidity through government-backed loans, and by offering advice as well as additional information and relevant services via our platform 'Doorpakken'. Internally, the pandemic accelerated the roll-out of several digital and/uni00A0remote tools like video banking and digital signing.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nWe want to deliver the best customer experience by continually improving our products and services. To do so, we use the drivers of our Net Promoter Score and engage with our clients so that we can better understand their wishes and challenges, and support them where needed. Our Net Promoter Score in 2020 was -1, remaining virtually flat compared to +1 in 2019.\n\nWe are seeking to reinvent the customer experience by:\n\n- H Staying relevant for our clients by staying focused on their challenges. To help our clients meet their challenges, we intend to offer banking and non-banking propositions called 'Beyond Banking'. To do so, we need to rethink our portfolio of products and services and also establish partnerships that add value and make our offering more innovative. Of our SME clients surveyed, 71% say it is interesting that a bank is offering Beyond Banking propositions. We have therefore launched a new support platform for SMEs, called Doorpakken, which provides a wide range of Beyond Banking services.\n\nExamples are bookkeeping, single invoice factoring, cyber security, networking, HR/recruitment and carbon footprint calculation. In 2021, we will invest in a multi-disciplinary in-house team to further develop this/uni00A0platform;\n\n- H Increasing clients'/uni00A0self-reliance with regard to their service needs. In essence, this means accelerating the digitalisation of our most important sales and service journeys. We are focusing on making the 25 service journeys most frequently used by clients likeable and digitally available. Our new, fast and convenient onboarding journey will also be extended to allow clients to opt for one of our three product packages and purchase other relevant products/uni00A0in one go;\n- H Extending the opportunities for commercial clients to/uni00A0interact with us in a convenient way of their choice through video banking, live chats, digital document exchange and digital signing. Video banking ensures a better, more flexible and sustainable experience for interacting with our staff and allows for personal contact in this Covid-19 period of social distancing. Over 50% of all client conversations are already being held via video banking. Thanks to live chats, digital document exchange and digital signing, we are also improving the speed and convenience with which clients can interact with us, while continuing to safeguard/uni00A0their privacy.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe want to help our clients accelerate their shift to sustainability. We do this by offering suitable sustainable products and services, embedding sustainability in our existing products and services, engaging in sustainable deals and partnerships, and actively educating our employees about this topic. This expertise helps us to be our clients' first-choice partner for sustainability in climate change, the circular economy and social impact.\n\nCommercial Banking has continued to develop a sustainable investment tool that/uni00A0gives clients easy insight into ways to reduce the environmental footprint of their real estate. They can then use this insight to undertake targeted action.\n\nIn 2020, we supported clients' shift to sustainability by entering into various sustainable, circular and social impact deals, including:\n\n- H Financing/uni00A0a provider of electric buses for urban and rural public transport in the European market. In this way, ABN/uni00A0AMRO is helping to meet the growing demand for electric buses and so enable the provision of reliable, sustainable and emission-free public transport;\n- H Arranging a finance package for a/uni00A0healthcare group to help consolidate local healthcare services and so\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The centre will be self-supporting and energy-neutral because, for example, water from the Maas river will be used for cooling and heating and solar panels will be/uni00A0installed on and around the building. As the centre/uni00A0will be built entirely from wood panels, it/uni00A0will be easy to construct and disassemble. This sustainable project is being financed by ABN/uni00A0AMRO Groenbank.\n\nOur research indicates that 83% of our clients are willing to/uni00A0invest in sustainable business operations. About half of/uni00A0them have concrete plans for 2021. Sustainability is an important topic to our clients and is part of most of the conversations we have with clients.\n\nThanks to the close dialogues we have with our clients and/uni00A0our continued focus on offering sustainable solutions, ABN/uni00A0AMRO Groenbank's business volumes are increasing. Despite Covid-19, Groenbank had a successful year, doubling its volume to 234/uni00A0million green certificates and/uni00A0increasing its/uni00A0market share to 13% as part of the/uni00A0government's Green Scheme.\n\nDuring the year, we also launched a new initiative, Impact Nation, in the form of a national ecosystem aimed at uniting and facilitating entrepreneurs with the practical side of making their companies more sustainable. The initiative involves linking medium- and larger-sized companies with innovative tech and impact companies worldwide (mainly start-ups and scale-ups) so that, together, they can seek to solve the challenge in a 100-day programme designed in co-creation with The Next Web Amsterdam and the Impact Hub.\n\nWe also shared our knowledge on non-financial impact topics with our clients, including on Energy Transition Thursday. By sharing our knowledge of sustainable earning models we are building engagement with clients and raising awareness on topics relating to sustainability.\n\nThe year 2020 was a year of extensive dialogue with our clients, as well as a year of data analytics. As climate change can create both risks and opportunities, we started preparing climate scenario risk analyses for our activities in the commercial real estate, shipping, energy and mortgage sectors. Having this dialogue and analysing the data also resulted in a new E-learning programme, providing in-depth knowledge for all client-facing employees.\n\n## Future-proof bank\n\nIn 2020, we continued to work to equip CB for the future and made progress on the priorities that are essential for becoming future-proof. We further improved CB's operational\n\n/  45\n\nefficiency by investing in easy-to-use client solutions and optimising processes and documentation. We also implemented new ways of working in an increasingly strict regulatory environment in order to ensure solid foundations. This will have a positive effect on the strategy review as the progress we have achieved has created a good basis for\n\nfurther developing our initiatives and efforts./uni00A0\n\nKnow Your Client (KYC) is still a high priority for us. We are\n\nmaking progress in remedying our client files. We are gradually rolling out a new identification and verification tool that clients can use to authenticate their identity remotely. The first version of the digital Ultimate Beneficial Owner tool has gone live. We are also improving the way changes in boards and legal structures are processed. With regard to/uni00A0credits, we are running a series of projects that contribute to future-proof lending, while a substantial part of our product portfolio has been rationalised. We have started phasing in the use of a new customer relationship management (CRM) platform, Microsoft Dynamics Platform (MSD). This will help us to continue building strong, loyal relationships with our clients. To accelerate the workforce planning we are implementing a professional Workforce Management system, Verint.\n\nCovid-19 has also had an impact on how we work at\n\nCommercial Banking. We had to adapt to the new way of/uni00A0working very quickly in order to continue serving our clients. With working from home now being the new norm, we put a lot of effort into the engagement of our employees. Overall,/uni00A0the Employee Engagement Survey showed an/uni00A0engagement score of (84%), which is an improvement compared to our score in 2019 (80%). We/uni00A0achieved good progress in various areas, including the strong improvement recorded for risk of turnover among employees and senior management.\n\n## Financial review Financial highlights\n\n- H Net interest income declined mainly as a result of continued pressure on deposit margins. Lower average corporate loan volumes (largely reflecting lower demand) were partly offset by higher deposit volumes, both as a result of/uni00A0Covid-19.\n- H Net fee and commission income remained stable despite the impact of Covid-19, which particularly affected payment services ('pay per use'), factoring (volumes) and trade. This decline was fully offset by increased fixed pricing.\n- H Operating expenses increased mainly as a result of the/uni00A0upscaling of AML activities.\n- H Impairment charges amounted to EUR/uni00A0542/uni00A0million in 2020, and largely included individual stage 3 impairments (mainly attributable to/uni00A0the sectors food, shipping, and industrial goods & services), and to a lesser extent management overlays in stage 1 and 2 to cover expected credit losses that were not captured by the models.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our international expertise, local knowledge and over 350 years of experience in private banking form the basis of our long-standing client relationships. Private Banking is present in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium.\n\nWe bring personal service, digital convenience and a proactive mentality to a full range of banking and wealth management products and services for high net worth clients in the Netherlands with more than EUR/uni00A0500,000 in investable assets, or more than EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million outside the Netherlands, and for ultra-high net worth clients with more than EUR/uni00A025/uni00A0million in investable assets. Our holistic approach provides families, entrepreneurs, institutions and/uni00A0charities with expert advice that is risk-controlling, forward-looking and sustainable, both economically and/uni00A0environmentally. We are modern and enterprising, embracing open architecture and keeping pace with investment trends. Our digital innovations are driven by client needs, industry advances and societal developments, giving clients real-time wealth insights and oversight.\n\n## Business developments Introduction\n\nCovid-19 was the overriding theme of 2020. With various degrees of lockdown in the countries in which we operate, our normal ways of doing business were obviously interrupted. Fortunately, video banking had already been introduced in every country in which we operate, and the exceptional circumstances greatly contributed to further adoption of opportunities for digital meetings. Private banking consistently and very actively reached out to clients throughout the year, keeping them well informed about market developments, but also seeking to connect across/uni00A0client communities through online seminars and virtual concerts and in other creative ways. ABN/uni00A0AMRO MeesPierson, for example, marked its 300-year anniversary by commissioning the contemporary artist Joseph Klibansky to make his biggest painting ever. This canvas, measuring over 38 square metres and entitled Beyond the Clouds, was divided into thousands of small works of art and shared with all ABN/uni00A0AMRO MeesPierson/uni00A0clients and employees. While Covid-19 impacted on how we were able to interact with clients, it did not affect what we could offer them and our endeavours to continue improving our private bank.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nIn 2020, we continued to work on delivering products and services that meet our clients' needs. We brought together and intensified marketing, sales management and data management to make our client offerings even more proactive, relevant and personal./uni00A0We have also mapped out various customer journeys (such as onboarding new clients) to identify potential pain-points and improve the experience, thus working to combine convenience and expertise as a key differentiator, as laid out in our strategy review. To better meet specific client needs, we use a segmented approach (Entrepreneurs & Enterprises, Institutions & Charities, Professionals & Executives), including events with targeted information and opportunities for networking with peers and experts, in line with the focus segments defined in our strategy review./uni00A0\n\nWe give clients easy, timely access to expertise by enabling/uni00A0our investment specialists to keep them abreast of/uni00A0trends and developments via, for example, client portals, newsletters and live webinars. The negative interest rate environment and the impact of Covid-19 have led investors to look for alternative investments. To address this, we have introduced advice on private equity and structured products and brokered tailored structured product deals for clients, as well as successfully launching private equity products such as Private Equity Coller International Partners VII (a secondaries fund) across the/uni00A0Private Banking countries.\n\nIn/uni00A0May/uni00A0we announced that agreement had been reached to/uni00A0transfer ABN/uni00A0AMRO MeesPierson's activities as testamentary administrator, executor and authorised representative ('Bewind & Executele') to Capital Support, a/uni00A0specialised Family and Charity Office. This fits in with our ambition to advise and serve clients independently and to partner with external experts where this is beneficial for clients. Our collaboration with Aegon Asset Management in/uni00A0the Global impact equity fund is another example of this/uni00A0approach.\n\nIn/uni00A0October/uni00A02020 we were pleased to be named the Best Overall European Private Bank by WealthBriefing, which referred to 'an admirable focus on proactively going out to clients and unflinchingly asking for guidance on how they can improve to reinvent the customer experience. Strong NPS scores and a sustainability focus also really impressed the judges.'\n\nThe year 2020 was a challenging year for the financial markets. Equity markets initially fell in response to the outbreak of the virus, but rebounded strongly in the second half of the year. As a result, most investment porfolios\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the year, we supported our clients through frequent webinars and regular digital communications./uni00A0 The Net Promoter Scores (NPS) for 2020 show that our clients continue to appreciate our efforts, with the NPS increasing significantly to +13 (from +9 in 2019).\n\n## Sustainability\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO sees a role for private banking to support clients towards more sustainable investment portfolios. And not only are we experiencing a growing demand for sustainable investments, but we also believe it is in our clients' interests to invest in a more sustainable manner as this can mitigate their investment risk. As climate-related risks can be material in investment portfolios, we measure and report on portfolio carbon emissions. We believe it is our responsibility to inform and advise clients on sustainability developments in sectors and industries and also to reflect our stance in policies and processes for ABN/uni00A0AMRO Investment Solutions.\n\nIn 2020, we significantly exceeded our ambition of having EUR/uni00A016 billion in client assets invested sustainably, reaching EUR/uni00A026 billion by the year-end (including EUR/uni00A01 billion in impact investments)./uni00A0This increase was attributable to an almost 50% increase in sustainable contracts, the transition from traditional to sustainable products and solutions, and financial market effects.\n\nTo enable our clients to make more sustainable choices, we have made a Sustainability Scan available in all Private Banking countries. This tool gives/uni00A0clients insight into the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of their portfolios, and our private bankers and investment advisors are well trained to discuss the outcomes with them. Over 1000 private bankers have participated in the 'Oxford Fundamentals of Sustainable and Impact Investing Programme' delivered by Oxford University's Sa\u00efd Business School, and more than 1500 of our staff have been certified by the PRI Academy following an on-line learning programme. They are supported by our specialised consultants working across countries to advise organisations on impact and sustainability.\n\nBy making more sustainable investment products and services available to our international client base, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has been able to make sustainable investing the default option for new clients in all countries where Private Banking is active. In Q4 2020 we launched the ABN/uni00A0AMRO Aegon Global Impact Fund, which invests in global listed companies that align their activities with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Aegon Asset Management engages, on behalf of ABN/uni00A0AMRO clients, with portfolio companies on improving ESG standards and encouraging further SDG alignment, including commitments in the Paris Agreement. Clients now receive\n\n/  48\n\nnon-financial impact reporting so that they can track progress in achieving societal impact, including carbon emissions and SDG alignment. All discretionary portfolio management and advisory clients now receive such reporting on a quarterly basis, thus raising their awareness of portfolios'/uni00A0non-financial performance.\n\nThe EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation is expected to be implemented in/uni00A0March/uni00A02021. This will facilitate the introduction of products with environmental and social characteristics and that have sustainable investment as an objective. We will update our policies, based on new insights gained.\n\n## Future-proof bank\n\nIn 2020, we continued our 'One PB' approach aimed at harmonising processes, services and product offerings across private banking locations. This will enable us to further digitalise our services and processes, innovate efficiently and equip clients and staff with new digital capabilities, supporting the ambition expressed in the strategy review to be a personal bank in the digital age.\n\nAs part of the One PB approach, first-line risk management is being harmonised across the Private Banking countries, including the introduction and execution of new regulations, while we are also in the process of moving all countries to a single platform (with the exception of the Netherlands, which shares its platform with Retail Banking). The platform has been live in Belgium since 2019, with the private banking activities of Societe Generale now fully integrated, and web and app services were made available in 2020. As a result, clients have unlimited and secure access, at any time, to up-to-date views of their investment portfolios.\n\nWe have started preparations for rolling out the platform in Germany. This will be followed by France in a multi-year programme. All the private banking entities' websites have been renewed and now share the same 'look and feel', reflecting the One PB approach.\n\nWe are continuing to build a Private Banking culture as an important element of our One PB ambition. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has meant we have had to do so largely virtually. However, our scores improved in most of the 2020 EES categories, in line with the bank-wide results, with significant increases being achieved in 'vision and direction' and 'senior management', the dimensions focused on in the/uni00A0One PB. The score for 'work life balance and work pressure', on the other hand, was slightly lower, and this most probably reflects the impact of working from home in/uni00A0the sometimes challenging circumstances caused by/uni00A0Covid-19.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Corporate & Institutional Banking\n\n## Business description\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) has a client base totalling more than 2,000 clients. We have a strong market position in the Netherlands, serving clients with revenues in excess of EUR 250 million. CIB has been leveraging on the strong domestic franchise in selected Northwest European countries, where it serves clients in a variety of sectors. Globally the focus has been on three selected sectors (Natural Resources, Transportation and Logistics, Trade &/uni00A0Commodity Finance (TCF)), with a CIB presence in 14/uni00A0countries or jurisdictions. CIB is sector-led and offers a wide range of services and products in global markets and lending. We have specialised activities in Clearing. In 2020, the bank conducted an in-depth review of the CIB/uni00A0activities, as a result of which CIB will be active only in/uni00A0markets where it has scale and can be sufficiently profitable, while CIB will further reduce risk in cyclical and/uni00A0historical global sectors.\n\n## Business developments Introduction\n\nWhen announcing its results for the 2019 financial year, the bank stated that it would be reviewing all the CIB activities in order to improve long-term profitability and reduce the very high cost of risk, with further elevated levels having been reported in both Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.\n\nOn 12/uni00A0August/uni00A02020,/uni00A0reflecting the strategic principles underpinning the bank-wide strategy,/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced the following/uni00A0strategic direction for CIB:\n\n- H Sector-based relationship bank with strong domestic franchise;\n- H CIB/uni00A0maintains its leading market position in the Netherlands by providing a full-service offering across all sectors;\n- H CIB's core activities/uni00A0focus on servicing clients in Northwest Europe in selected sectors (such as financial institutions, shipping and energy) and transition themes (energy, mobility and digital transition) with a strong connection to the Netherlands across a focused geographical footprint;\n- H The corporate banking activities in the United States, Asia, Australia and Brazil will be wound down, while Clearing will retain its global presence;\n- H TCF activities will be discontinued globally;\n- H Natural Resources and Transportation & Logistics will focus on European clients only.\n\nThe wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio is well on track, with the activities regarded as non-core expected to/uni00A0have been fully wound down by 2024. We have seen a/uni00A0strong decline in the/uni00A0portfolio, mainly in TCF. Where\n\npossible, we will accelerate the natural wind-down through loan disposals while safeguarding value.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic determined the course of the global economy in 2020 and impacted the countries in which CIB operates. However its impact/uni00A0varied between sectors and clients. And although it/uni00A0interrupted the normal ways of doing business, it also accelerated the adopting of new ways of working and interacting with clients. Client intimacy and short communication lines proved to be especially vital during this period. Throughout the year CIB offered support to its clients in various ways and also provided/uni00A0Garantie Ondernemingsfinanciering corona (GO-C) facilities on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe financial results of CIB for 2020 were marked by Covid-19, but were also impacted by impairments in a number of large exceptional client files. Clearing has taken several de-risking measures following a large loss incurred earlier in 2020.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nCIB focuses on a strong, personalised offerings and developing close relationships with our clients. CIB's business model is built on sustainable relationships with multi-product clients. We use the drivers of our Net Promoter Score (NPS) and continually engage with our clients in order to better understand their wishes and challenges, and/uni00A0to support them where needed. Our NPS in/uni00A02020 was 35, up from 29 in 2019. The NPS includes/uni00A0Clearing.\n\nReinventing the customer experience is helping CIB set new product and service standards that are both clientfocused and data-driven, and is also raising the bar to continually improve this experience. At CIB, reinventing the customer experience consists of a series of initiatives, including:\n\n- H Implementing video banking to engage with our clients in a different way while continuing to/uni00A0service/uni00A0them as optimally as possible in order to: i) improve the customer experience, with our banker always being only one click away, and ii) reduce our CO 2 footprint through virtual meetings;\n- H Improving the customer journey through, for example,/uni00A0simplified New Client Take On (NCTO) and loan application processes. These initiatives aim to minimise the burden on our clients and to create smoother processes, thus/uni00A0enabling/uni00A0us to provide feedback to our clients more quickly;\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

These initiatives provide our clients with efficient and digital solutions for/uni00A0handling/uni00A0complex transactions securely;\n- H Expanding capabilities such as improved client dashboards and steering on NPS metrics. These tools enable us to gain better insight/uni00A0into clients'/uni00A0needs and to adapt our service on a continual/uni00A0basis.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nCIB aims to create long-term value for and with the bank's clients and other stakeholders. We want to contribute to the transition to a sustainable economy that is greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-neutral and respectful of human rights, and that protects our planet's life, land and water. We are supporting our clients in their transition to more sustainable products and business models by making use of our data, knowledge and expertise. Our objective is to create a positive impact through the capital we mobilise for sustainability objectives, through the strategic dialogues we have with our clients and through actively participating in sustainability forums and platforms relevant to our sectors and clients.\n\nIn 2020, for example, we deployed multiple initiatives in support of our sustainable ambitions such as:\n\n- H Entering into green deals, for example to accelerate the energy transition by arranging finance for a portfolio of 12 onshore wind farms in Northern Spain;\n- H Encouraging shipping companies to set targets for/uni00A0reducing/uni00A0emissions by linking various ship finance transactions to the Poseidon Principles, to which ABN/uni00A0AMRO is a signatory;\n- H Providing support as lead arranger for one of our clients in its first Covid-19-related Social Bond to provide/uni00A0funding for investments needed to manage the effects of the pandemic;\n- H Contributing/uni00A0to the development of 'Blue Bonds' by actively participating/uni00A0in the UN Global Compact. These bonds support sustainable ocean business opportunities and make a significant contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs);\n- H Participating in the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) working group developing 'Transition bond' guidelines.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is also committed to achieving a Paris-proof economy by 2030. This means its financial exposure to climate-critical sectors must be aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. CIB is an active lender in sectors with high carbon intensity, such as the energy and shipping sectors. We conduct regular climate risk analyses to identify potential risks, to steer the portfolio and to set specific targets to mitigate these risks to a level that we are\n\ncomfortable with and that is in line with our moderate risk profile. In 2020, for example, we benchmarked our energy portfolio against the 2 degree scenario in the Paris Agreement and publicly shared our analysis and the insights gained with our various stakeholders. The year 2020 was also the first year in which we benchmarked and reported our shipping portfolio under the Poseidon Principles. These principles create a framework for assessing and disclosing the climate alignment of ship finance portfolios and follow the targets for reducing GHG emissions set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The insights gained through this analysis will allow us to steer our portfolio towards alignment with the IMO targets, and to engage and team up with our clients on decarbonising the shipping sector.\n\nThe topic of sustainability is at the top of many of our clients' minds. We are consequently seeing an increased interest in financing solution products related to sustainability. In 2020, for example, and despite the difficult circumstances caused by Covid-19, sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) more than doubled compared to 2019./uni00A0These loans are contingent on borrowers meeting tangible sustainability objectives, such as an increase in the use of renewable energy, or an increase in diversity and supplier screening, with modest interest rate reductions offered to borrowers who achieve measurable progress during the life of the loan. In contrast to Green Loans, which are specifically linked to the financing of an identified green asset, SLLs are linked to the/uni00A0fulfilment of certain sustainable objectives./uni00A0By entering into an SLL, a borrower 'financially' commits to meeting the sustainable objectives, and this acts as a strong signal to internal and external stakeholders alike.\n\nThe year 2020 was also a record year for our Sustainable Capital Markets team. This meant a very active year for debt/uni00A0capital market products, through which ABN/uni00A0AMRO mobilised capital and supported over EUR/uni00A010 billion of/uni00A0sustainable bonds, including 24 Green Bonds, 3 sustainability bonds and a Covid-19-related Social Bond, for/uni00A0a wide range of European institutions.\n\nLastly, and to ensure that we mobilise capital towards sectors, clients and transactions that meet our sustainability standards, the bank has developed a comprehensive Sustainability Risk Policy Framework. This defines the minimum standards for the sectors in which CIB is active, as well as the Equator Principles for our project-related financing. We use our Client Assessment on Sustainability (CASY) tool to assess clients and lending transactions for compliance with the bank's sustainability risk policies. The/uni00A0outcome of the CASY tool gives us insight into clients' sustainability performance and supports strategic dialogue with them, and may also form the basis for setting objectives in sustainability-linked transactions.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Future-proof bank\n\nAs part of the drive to build a future-proof bank, CIB focused its efforts in 2020 on improving our operational efficiency, focusing on making processes more simple and more data-driven. We took major strides with initiatives in areas such as IT transformation, where we aim to increase the speed, quality and efficiency of our delivery of IT solutions through the DevOps transformation. We also focused on building our Data Strategy by obtaining approval in early June/uni00A0for the Joint Master Plan (JMP) that enables end-toend orchestration and predictability of our data journey. This plan spans all business lines, functions, grids, subsidiaries and entities (including our international entities) and incorporates all the existing data management-related interventions.\n\nThe Future Credit Landscape programme was launched to/uni00A0create a future-proof credit landscape and ensure we remain relevant for our customers. As lending represents the majority of our operating income, it is important to safeguard and increase this source of income, and essential to operate a bank-wide strategy in this respect. This strategy aims to create a customer-driven, digitally enabled end-to-end credit journey and covers the bank's entire credit lifecycle activities. All these activities reflect our purpose to have social impact and to positively contribute to climate change and the circular economy.\n\nThe future-proof bank initiative also focuses on people because we want to unleash the potential of our people throughout their careers and fully equip them so that, together, we can achieve our strategic objectives and contribute to the bank's purpose. This year's activities included the talent and succession management cycle and/uni00A0the participation by multiple leaders in the Leading for Better Programme. Meanwhile HR, Facility Management, Digital Workplace, Procurement and Communication continued to collaborate to shape the Future of Work in a 'remote is the norm' scenario. This year, we also organised the first digital version of the Learning Week, offering more than 150 courses based on the CIB strategic journey, the bank-wide strategy and the three pillars. This event is one way in which we are helping our employees to develop new/uni00A0skills and ensure they remain fit for the future./uni00A0\n\nCIB's employee engagement score for 2020 was 79. This takes account of the strategy review, with CIB core scoring 81 and CIB non-core (US, APAC and TCF)/uni00A0scoring 71. The 2019 score -/uni00A0for the full population -/uni00A0was 78.\n\nThe plans from 2021 onwards will build on our current efforts, with the outcome of the strategy review being taken into account. These plans include a streamlined product portfolio, sourcing decisions supporting the value proposition of customer segments and the IT transformation, and all enabled by a strong focus on people development, leadership and culture.\n\n## Financial review Financial highlights\n\n- H Clear choices were made in the strategy review, with geographical focus on the Netherlands and Northwest Europe.\n- H Net interest income declined largely as a result of lower average corporate loan volumes (mostly in CIB noncore)/uni00A0and, to a lesser extent, ongoing deposit margin pressure.\n- H Net fee and commission income improved mainly as a result of higher market volatility (at Clearing), which was partly offset by the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n- H Operating expenses in 2020 included EUR/uni00A0160/uni00A0million in one-offs for the CIB non-core wind-down, of which EUR/uni00A0103/uni00A0million was for personnel expenses.\n- H Impairment charges amounted to EUR/uni00A01,659/uni00A0million in 2020 and largely included three exceptional client files and individual stage 3 impairments, mainly in the energyservices sector.\n- H ABN/uni00A0AMRO and ODDO BHF entered into a strategic partnership to combine their equity brokerage services in Benelux, strengthening their leading positions while reducing costs.\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decline was mainly driven by lower average corporate loan volumes (mostly due to the CIB non-core wind-down) and, to a lesser extent, ongoing deposit margin pressure./uni00A0\n\nNet fee and commission income improved by EUR/uni00A024/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A0529/uni00A0million in 2020, mainly as a result of higher market volatility (at Clearing), which was partly offset by the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\nOther operating income amounted to EUR/uni00A032/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0132/uni00A0million). The decrease was largely attributable to negative fair market value adjustments on financial investments held at fair value through profit or/uni00A0loss in 2020 (as an effect of Covid-19), while 2019 included positive fair market value adjustments.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR/uni00A056/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0484/uni00A0million in 2020, largely due to a provision for the CIB non-core wind-down (EUR/uni00A0103/uni00A0million), which was partly offset by the release for discretionary variable remuneration in 2020 (EUR/uni00A022/uni00A0million), and to a lesser extent, lower pension costs (new CLA).\n\nOther expenses /uni00A0increased by EUR/uni00A058/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0727/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0669/uni00A0million), mainly due to EUR/uni00A057/uni00A0million recorded for provisioning related to the CIB non-core wind-down. Regulatory levies amounted to EUR/uni00A089/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A083/uni00A0million).\n\nImpairment charges were significant in 2020, totalling EUR/uni00A01,659/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A0376/uni00A0million), and largely included three exceptional client files and individual stage 3 impairments, mainly in the energy-services sector.\n\n## Other indicators\n\nLoans and advances customers /uni00A0declined by EUR/uni00A09.8/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A045.3/uni00A0billion in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A055.1/uni00A0billion), mainly reflecting the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\nDue to customers increased by EUR/uni00A02.2 billion to EUR/uni00A028.7 billion in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A026.5 billion), largely caused by higher client deposits as Covid-19 led to limited investment opportunities for clients.\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Group Functions\n\n## Business description\n\nGroup Functions consists of the following main departments: Innovation & Technology, Finance, Risk Management, HR & Transformation, Group Audit, Strategy & Sustainability, Legal, Corporate Office and Brand, Marketing & Communications./uni00A0The majority/uni00A0of Group Functions'/uni00A0costs are allocated to the business lines.\n\n## Innovation & Technology\n\nInnovation & Technology supports the group by powering innovation, managing group programmes (such as product rationalisation, and driving consistency and consolidation across customer processes) and providing services in the areas of technology, information security, data, back-office processing, facilities management and procurement. I&T has a group-wide scope in both the Netherlands and internationally. Its key deliverable is the IT Transformation, which focuses on automation (by implementing the DevOps way of working), optimising the workforce (by right-sourcing and up-skilling) and reducing complexity by adopting cloud/uni00A0services.\n\n## Finance\n\nFinance enables and safeguards the execution of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's long-term strategy. It is the primary supplier of management and reporting information to the group's internal and external stakeholders. Finance has a leading role in the strategic and financial planning process. The function has an independent role in delivering management information and ensuring financially sound business cases and decisions. Finance provides a/uni00A0strong financial control environment and ensures compliance with relevant accounting standards and requirements set by the regulatory authorities. It consists of the following main departments: Financial Accounting, Controlling, Investor Relations, ALM, Treasury and Tax.\n\n## Risk Management/uni00A0\n\nA strong, sustainable bank relies on sound risk management. Risk Management secures a sound risk/ reward ratio by maintaining a bank-wide, moderate risk profile as part of the bank's long-term strategy. This risk profile is managed on the basis of an integrated risk management framework. All identified risk events are assessed and mapped according to risk types, sub-risk types and overarching risks in order to provide a single, integrated view of the risk profile of the bank and its various businesses. Risk Management takes careful account of this integrated risk profile and seeks to balance actions in order to ensure that the moderate risk profile is maintained in accordance with the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement. The/uni00A0main risk types we recognise are credit risk, market\n\nrisk in the banking book, market risk in the trading book, liquidity risk, business risk and operational (non-financial) risk. These main risk types comprise various sub-risk types. Risk appetite statements are set for both the main and sub-risk types. The six main risk types cover all possible events that directly impact the franchise value of the bank. This includes its financial value, but also its 'goodwill', i.e. the value of the bank's reputation. The Risk, funding & capital management section of this report elaborates on the/uni00A0bank's risk profile, risk taxonomy and risk appetite.\n\nIncluded in the Risk Mangement function is Compliance. The Compliance function is a bank-wide integrated function that maintains oversight of the countries in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates./uni00A0Compliance responsibilities run deep in the bank's processes and procedures, and it is a strategic priority of ABN AMRO to embed a strong compliance culture in the culture of the bank and the behaviour of all staff. Effective compliance management is an essential contributor to protecting our integrity and reputation and supports the bank in achieving its mission and strategic objectives. Compliance management aims to protect the bank, its clients and its employees against compliance risks and behavioural risks. These can be defined as the risk of failure to comply with legislation and regulations, self-regulatory organisation standards, values and principles, and codes of conduct, or generally accepted market standards applicable to the bank's services and activities; the risk that actions, decisions and behaviour by ABN/uni00A0AMRO or its employees will lead to detrimental or poor outcomes for clients, employees, society or the bank itself, and the risk that we fail to maintain high standards of ethical behaviour and integrity.\n\n## HR/uni00A0& Transformation\n\nHR & Transformation's/uni00A0primary responsibility is to support the group by investing in an optimal people experience and culture. HR&T makes sure we attract the right talent, develop the right skills and offer people a diverse workplace with inspiring, inclusive leadership and healthy working conditions. HR&T contributes to the group's ambitions by/uni00A0providing services such as talent attraction, learning, executive development, attractive financial and non-financial rewards, and organisational design and development. By aligning our people's experience and services to the group's ambitions we are accelerating ABN/uni00A0AMRO's transformation towards a purpose-driven and client-centric business./uni00A0\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of this process, ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Foundation runs social projects and coordinates activities that promote social engagement.\n\n## Financial review Financial highlights\n\n- H Net interest income declined mainly as a result of/uni00A0adjusted accounting estimates for amortisation of penalty interest on mortgages/uni00A0and, to a lesser extent, fewer other positive one-offs in 2020 (mainly DSB claim).\n- H Other operating income was lower as 2019 included a EUR/uni00A0130/uni00A0million book gain for the sale of Stater.\n- H Operating expenses, excluding divestments (Stater), were EUR/uni00A071/uni00A0million lower than in 2019, as more costs were charged to the commercial business lines/uni00A0and cost-saving programmes were continued. The decrease was/uni00A0partly offset by the upscaling of AML/uni00A0activities.\n- H ABN/uni00A0AMRO partnered with Techstars, a/uni00A0global platform for investment and innovation, enabling ABN/uni00A0AMRO to identify and support innovative start-ups that will transform financial services, in order to accelerate digitalisation and innovation in line with its strategy.\n\n## Operating results\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                             | 2020   | 2019   | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Net interest income                              | -6     | 147    |          |\n| Net fee and commission income                    | -31    | -2     |          |\n| Other operating income                           | 82     | 238    | -66%     |\n| Operating income                                 | 45     | 383    | -88%     |\n| Personnel expenses                               | 774    | 734    | 5%       |\n| Other expenses                                   | -727   | -589   | -24%     |\n| Operating expenses                               | 47     | 145    | -68%     |\n| Operating result                                 | -1     | 238    |          |\n| Impairment charges on financial instruments      | -1     | -3     | 77%      |\n| Profit/(loss) before taxation                    | -1     | 241    |          |\n| Income tax expense                               | -33    | 1      |          |\n| Profit/(loss) for the period                     | 33     | 240    | -86%     |\n| Other indicators                                 |        |        |          |\n| Securities financing - assets (in billions)      | 11. 4  | 10.3   |          |\n| Loans and advances customers (in billions)       | 4.7    | 4.2    |          |\n| Securities financing - liabilities (in billions) | 11. 0  | 7. 7   |          |\n| Due to customers (in billions)                   | 6.8    | 2.7    |          |\n| Risk-weighted assets (in billions)               | 4.7    | 4.1    |          |\n| Employee FTEs                                    | 7,184  | 5,899  |          |\n\nIntroduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nStrategy\n\nBank performance\n\nBusiness performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

As/uni00A0this/uni00A0chapter of the Annual Report contains information based on EU IFRS as/uni00A0well/uni00A0as/uni00A0CRD IV/CRR, this section provides more information on differences in/uni00A0scope/uni00A0and consolidation.\n\n## Contents Risk, funding & capital management\n\nThis section sets out the bank's approach to risk, funding and capital management by describing strategy, policies, governance and measurement approaches.\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nPortfolio composition and developments are described in/uni00A0the Risk, funding & capital review, which also describes developments in the bank's main types of risk and regulatory capital.\n\n## Additional risk, funding & capital disclosures\n\nThis section provides additional disclosures required under/uni00A0current regulations.\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nThe Risk, funding & capital chapter presents the disclosures required under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act ( Wet op/uni00A0financieel toezicht - Wft ), title 9 book 2 of the Dutch Civil/uni00A0Code and EU IFRS. ABN/uni00A0AMRO also embraces the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) principles and recommendations. For non-financial disclosures required under the Dutch Decree on non-financial disclosures, ABN/uni00A0AMRO follows the guidance of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial disclosures (TCFD) and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NRFD) including its/uni00A0guidelines.\n\nCertain disclosures in the Risk, funding & capital chapter are an integral part of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements (AFS) and contain audited information. The/uni00A0audited parts concern risk disclosures of financial instruments (IFRS 7) and capital disclosures (IAS 1). Audited/uni00A0information in these sections is/uni00A0labelled as 'Audited' in the respective headings.\n\n## Risk exposure measurement and scope differences\n\nRisk measures vary according to the purpose for which the/uni00A0exposure is calculated: EU IFRS or the determination of/uni00A0regulatory or economic capital (CRD IV/CRR).\n\n## EU IFRS reporting scope\n\nEU IFRS is mainly used to measure the bank's financial results and position by class of product. In addition, the financial position according to EU IFRS provides a liquidity view instead of a credit risk view. The consolidation scope/uni00A0of ABN/uni00A0AMRO is determined in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. More information can be found in Note/uni00A01 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Regulatory reporting scope\n\nThe objective of regulatory reporting is to take a credit risk view on the bank's portfolio and to ensure that the bank maintains sufficient capital buffers for unexpected losses and sufficient liquidity buffers. The scope of consolidation for the purpose of calculating regulatory and economic capital (based on the CRD IV and CRR) is generally the same as the consolidation scope under EU IFRS and includes subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly controlled by ABN/uni00A0AMRO and active in the banking and financial sectors. Subsidiaries consolidated under EU IFRS but active in sectors other than banking and finance are excluded from/uni00A0the  regulatory  scope  of  consolidation       .\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk developments occurring during the reporting period are described in the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\n## Risk approach\n\n## Topics described in this section:\n\n- H Risk taxonomy\n- H Risk appetite\n- H Risk culture\n- H Risk governance\n- H Risk measurement\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO remains committed to being a well-capitalised bank with sufficient liquidity that focuses on delivering sustainable value to all of its stakeholders. We are committed to maintaining a sound balance between risk and reward and to pursuing a bank-wide moderate risk profile as part/uni00A0of/uni00A0our long-term strategy. We thoroughly evaluate the long-term risk and return implications of our operations on an ongoing basis. While the risk measurement, monitoring and management processes described in this chapter proved largely resilient, Covid-19 did reveal some shortcomings in/uni00A0our risk framework. High risk costs in CIB and specific individual client files led to tightened risk controls. Widespread liquidity support provided by banks and governments reduced the effectiveness of our existing risk framework and called for specific measures to correctly assess and classify our credit risk./uni00A0For more detailed information on our response to Covid-19, please refer to the/uni00A0Update on Covid-19 in the Risk, funding & capital review section./uni00A0We also redefined our risk appetite as part/uni00A0of the strategy review announced in/uni00A0November/uni00A02020.\n\nWe manage our risk profile by way of an integrated risk management framework, which identifies all types of risks/uni00A0and overarching risks, in order to provide a single, integrated view on the bank and its business lines. By taking an integrated view, we strive to carefully balance our actions to manage our moderate risk profile. The Enterprise Risk Management policy provides a formal approach to risk management at an enterprise level that is aligned with the/uni00A0bank's strategic objectives, including its risk profile.\n\nThe following sections describe the risk taxonomy, risk appetite, risk culture, risk governance and risk measurement, and how they contribute to a moderate risk profile. For more information on the balance sheet and income statement composition, please refer to the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\n## Risk taxonomy\n\n## b\n\nOur risk taxonomy classifies risks into risk types to which the bank is, or could be, exposed. It is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or sooner if any new actual or/uni00A0emerging risk type(s) manifest itself and requires an/uni00A0update. The taxonomy ensures that all identified material/uni00A0risks are defined and are taken into account in the/uni00A0risk/uni00A0governance framework. It creates a common risk vocabulary, provides a checklist of risk types that are used in risk assessments, and helps to ensure that all material risks are managed and that roles and responsibilities are identified and defined.\n\nThe main risk types we recognise are credit risk, market risk in the banking book, market risk in the trading book, liquidity risk, business risk and operational (non-financial) risk. These main risk types comprise various sub-risk types. Risk appetite statements are set for both the main and sub-risk types. The six main risk types cover all possible events that directly impact on the franchise value of the bank. This includes its financial value, but also its 'goodwill', i.e. the value of the bank's reputation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is regularly evaluated and updated to ensure alignment with the strategy.\n\nThe bank-wide risk appetite, which is to pursue a moderate risk profile, is an integral part of our corporate strategy. Specific business-line risk appetites further determine the bank-wide risk appetite. In addition, risk appetites exist at a local and material entity level. These risk appetites allow us to manage risk at every appropriate level within the bank, as shown in the figure below.\n\n## Risk appetite framework/uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarket risk banking book\n\nInterest rate risk FX risk Equity risk Credit spread risk\n\n## Enterprise risk\n\n## Market risk trading book\n\nInterest rate risk FX risk Equity risk Credit spread risk\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nFunding risk Market risk\n\n## Value of the bank\n\nFinancial\n\nReputational\n\nThe risk appetite follows the structure presented in the risk/uni00A0appetite framework figure. The Strategic Risk Appetite Statement expresses ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategy of pursuing a moderate risk profile and cascades into the risk indicator framework at various levels of the organisation: bank-wide (BRAS), business line (BLRAS), local (LRAS) and entity level (ERAS). The Strategic Risk Appetite Statement is approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nSenior management monitors the bank's activities, based on the risk appetite. The status of adherence to the risk appetite and the outlook are discussed monthly in the Executive Board and quarterly by the Supervisory Board, based on the Enterprise Risk Management report.\n\nThe elements of the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement ensure a coherent balance between return and value creation, supported by our client-centric business model, capital, and liquidity and funding management, while taking/uni00A0into account our conduct, governance and control framework shown in the following figure.

        "page_content": "## Strategic Risk Appetite Statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe statements in the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement are cascaded into and supported by an underlying risk indicator framework at bank, business line, entity and local levels. This risk indicator framework consists of statements set for each main and sub-risk type presented in the risk taxonomy. Each statement consists of one or more quantitative and/or qualitative indicators, referred to as key risk indicators (KRIs). For every KRI, a limit and checkpoint is set, against which the actual risk profile is monitored. If/uni00A0a/uni00A0KRI limit is breached, action is required to bring our risk profile back within the limit. Early warning checkpoints are in place to allow for timely action to prevent breaches and/ or to have a strategic discussion.\n\nExamples of KRIs in our risk appetite include:\n\n- H Regulatory and internal capital ratios;\n- H Risk-adjusted return measures;\n- H Concentration limits for single counterparties, sectors/uni00A0and countries;\n- H Economic capital and risk-weighted asset limits for/uni00A0various risk types;\n- H Liquidity ratios (LtD, LCR, NSFR);\n- H Market risk parameters (NII-at-Risk);\n- H Operational (non-financial) risk parameters (effectiveness/uni00A0of internal control environment);\n- H Reputational parameters (NPS, employee engagement score).\n\nWhen setting the statement in the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement and the statements for each risk type in the risk indicator framework, the following aspects are considered: the corporate strategy, market standards (such as peer analyses), the economic environment, regulations, the views of our stakeholders and the actual risk profile, as well as internal insights and risk management tools. In addition\n\nto incorporating these views, balancing these aspects provides us with the means to substantiate risk statements for each risk type.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nStrengthening our culture in the areas of risk, compliance and integrity was an important objective of the strategy review. ABN/uni00A0AMRO places strong emphasis on sound risk control in our remuneration policies, which are in line with our risk profile. More details are provided in the Remuneration Report in the Leadership & Governance chapter.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO ensures that our employees understand the/uni00A0need for and are able and willing to have a continuous focus on risk, compliance and integrity as an integral part of/uni00A0the bank-wide culture. Pursuing a moderate risk profile is/uni00A0embedded in our culture by means of continuous communication, awareness, education and training and steered through performance management and management KPIs that help underpin our belief that mitigating risks is everybody's responsibility.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEmployees are expected to adhere to the ABN/uni00A0AMRO culture principles and to act in accordance with the bank's Code of Conduct, which sets out standards of behavior. These principles are fundamental to everything we do and describe how we act as a bank, how we make decisions and how we deal with various dilemmas and, as such, are included in our permanent education tool. The Code of Conduct is published on our website and we are intensifying our monitoring of compliance with it. In addition, our employees are required to confirm their adherence to the Code of Conduct annually. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Ethics Committee, chaired by the CEO, meets regularly to discuss moral and ethical dilemmas within the bank and to clarify ABN/uni00A0AMRO's position, particularly in areas where policies cannot provide definitive guidance.\n\n## Ethics committee and Speak-Up\n\nWhere norms, rules or standards are insufficiently clear or pose a dilemma, ABN AMRO invests in moral learning and moral decision-making. ABN AMRO's Ethics Committee, chaired by the CEO, discusses ethical dilemmas on a strategic level to determine ABN AMRO's moral position in/uni00A0areas where regulations or policies do not provide clear guidance. Throughout the organisation, moral position sessions, dilemma dialogues and speak-up cafes are being used to help improve ethical decision-making skills and help determine what is right, taking into account the rights and interests of all stakeholders. ABN AMRO has strengthened the approachability and awareness of the various speak-up channels, ranging from speak-up ambassadors in the workplace to trusted persons and the whistleblowing hotline, in order to lower the threshold for speaking up, giving voice to values and signalling risks or possible issues.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Behavioural Risk\n\nBehavioural Risk has been added as a non-financial risk to our risk taxonomy. As well as helping the bank to more effectively measure, monitor and steer on the risk that actions, decisions and behaviours by the bank and its employees (as a group and individually) lead to detrimental or poor outcomes for clients, society, stakeholders or the bank itself, this addition helps to maintain high standards of/uni00A0market behaviour and/uni00A0integrity. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's approach to/uni00A0behavioural risk management assesses the presence of risks that could lead to undesirable behaviour (behavioural risk assessment) and seeks to enable and promote desired behaviour through effective change measures (behavioural change).\n\n## Risk governance b\n\nThe Executive Board, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO define the governance arrangements designed to ensure effective and prudent management of the bank and oversee their implementation. They are accountable for setting, approving and overseeing the implementation of the bank's enterprise risk management framework, including:\n\n- H an adequate and effective internal governance and internal control framework. This includes a clear organisational structure and well-functioning independent internal control functions (Risk Management, Compliance and Group Audit) that have sufficient authority, stature and resources to perform their functions;\n- H the three lines of defence model at all levels of the bank;\n- H a risk culture that/uni00A0addresses risk awareness and risk-taking behaviour in the bank;\n- H key policies of the bank within the applicable legal and/uni00A0regulatory framework;\n- H the bank's overall strategy, risk strategy and risk appetite;\n- H the amounts, types and distribution of internal capital and regulatory capital needed to ensure that the risks that the Bank is exposed to are adequately covered;\n- H targets for the bank's liquidity and funding management.\n\nThe Risk Management organisation operates under the direct responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer, who is a member of/uni00A0the Executive Board.\n\n## Executive risk committees\n\nThe Executive Board is accountable for a balanced assessment of the bank's commercial interests and the risks to be taken within the boundaries of the risk appetite. In the risk decision-making framework, the Executive Board is supported by three executive risk committees: the Group Risk Committee, the Group Central Credit Committee and the Group Regulatory Committee, each of which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. The mandates of the executive risk  committees  are  summarised  below\n\n## Group Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) is mandated by the Executive Board to monitor, assess and manage the bank's/uni00A0risk profile within the approved risk appetite. GRC/uni00A0monitors and approves all material risks as defined in/uni00A0the Risk Taxonomy of the Bank. The GRC has delegated specific approval powers to sub-committees, including Business Risk Committees for the bank's main business lines, the Financial Crime Risk Committee, the Methodology Acceptance Group, the Scenario and Stress Testing Committee, and the Impairment and Provisioning Committee.\n\n## Group Central Credit Committee\n\nThe Group Central Credit Committee (CCC) is mandated by the Executive Board to make decisions on the acceptance of credit and counterparty risk in respect of individual persons, legal persons and public administrative bodies relating to credit proposals falling within the scope of the risk appetite and limits determined by the Executive Board. In addition, the CCC is also responsible for approving and/uni00A0monitoring  large  intercompany  credit  facilities       .\n\n## Group Regulatory Committee\n\nThe Group Regulatory Committee is mandated by the Executive Board to ensure a good understanding and adequate overview, making choices and taking decisions on/uni00A0matters relating to timely regulatory compliance to new/uni00A0and changing national and international legislation and/uni00A0regulations affecting the bank.\n\n## Three lines of defence/uni00A0\n\nThe three lines of defence model aims to clarify the relationship between risk takers and the different internal control functions, and provide clarity for all employees within the bank with regards to their risk management responsibilities. The three lines of defence model must be applied across all risk types and covers the whole organisation, including the Executive Board, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board, the customer-facing business lines, functions, the Risk Management organisation, outsourced activities and distribution channels.\n\n- H The first line of defence consists of management within each business or function who must own and is responsible for managing the risks they incur in conducting their activities and for the design and/uni00A0execution of effective and efficient controls.\n- H The second line of defence consists of dedicated departments in the Risk Management organisation who are responsible for setting the risk management framework within which the first line must operate. These dedicated departments are headed by risk type/uni00A0owners.\n- H The third line of defence consists of Group Audit, which/uni00A0evaluates the effectiveness of the governance, risk management and control processes/uni00A0in order to/uni00A0strengthen management's/uni00A0solution focus and accountability./uni00A0Group Audit has a coordinating role towards the external auditor and the supervisor.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The models for credit, operational, market, liquidity and business risk are the most widely used and allow for measuring the level of risk. They support day-to-day decision-making, as well as periodic monitoring and reporting on developments in the bank's portfolios and activities. In most cases, models quantify the probability and severity of an event, i.e. the likelihood that an event will occur and the loss the bank may suffer as a consequence of that event. This information serves as the basis for ABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal measures of risk (economic capital) and as key input for calculating the minimum regulatory capital requirements according to the Basel framework (regulatory capital).\n\nNew models require approval before being implemented and used. Internal approval for the use (or continued use) of/uni00A0a model is obtained from the Methodology Acceptance Group (MAG), a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee. When required, external approval is obtained from the/uni00A0regulator.\n\nThe modelling departments develop models in close cooperation with the relevant business and risk experts. In/uni00A0principle, we review models at least every three years, or/uni00A0earlier if there is a marked deterioration in performance of the model or a marked change in the risk profile of the/uni00A0portfolio to which the model relates. A model review includes back-testing against historical data and, where relevant, benchmarking the calibration of the models with external studies.\n\nThe independent model risk management department validates internal models. The model risk management framework, which includes model validation standards and/uni00A0procedures, ensures that models are validated independently. Model data, methodology, performance and\n\nResponsible for\n\n- Setting the risk management framework and policies\n- Monitoring, reporting and escalating\n- Providing expertise and challenge to 1st line\n- Ensuring 1st line takes risk ownership\n\n## Responsible for\n\n- Evaluating the design and effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes\n- Discussing with management on remediation and monitoring follow-up\n\nimplementation are checked according to these standards and reviewed against internal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Capital measurement Regulatory capital (CRD IV/CRR) b\n\nUnder the Basel framework as implemented in European legislation (CRD IV and CRR), banks are required to hold capital to cover financial risks. As an intermediate step in determining the minimum level of capital, banks need to calculate risk-weighted assets (RWA) for three major risk types (credit, operational and market risk). The outcome of/uni00A0the internal models are an input in this calculation. The capital requirements are stated as a percentage of RWA. Under Pillar 1, banks are required to hold a regulatory fixed percentage of RWA in capital. Under Pillar 2, supervisors impose a bank-specific percentage of RWA in addition to/uni00A0the Pillar 1 requirement.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nIn addition to regulatory required capital, for Pillar 2 we calculate economic capital (EC). Economic capital covers all risk types in our risk taxonomy for which capital is deemed to be the mitigating instrument to cover unexpected losses, and is used as the key metric for internal risk measurement and management. It is the amount of capital we reserve in order to achieve a sufficient level of protection against large unexpected losses that could result from extreme market conditions or events.\n\nInternal models are used to calculate EC at a 99.95% confidence level and a one-year time horizon. This implies that the estimated capital figure for the coming year is sufficient to cover a level of loss that will be exceeded in only 0.05% of all possible cases. The confidence level is linked to the bank's target credit rating and aligned with the/uni00A0definition of total available financial resources (total AFR). In addition, the ratio of core AFR versus EC is monitored. Core AFR is the amount of capital that is available to cover\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3rd Line of Defence Group Audit\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to monitor and secure the quality of the EC framework and its outcome in terms of capital adequacy, an EC Quality Assessment (ECQA) is performed annually as part of the ICAAP. For each main risk type, the calculated EC figure is evaluated in terms of risk coverage and responsiveness to internal and external developments such as in the areas of regulation and data quality. If considered necessary, an additional capital buffer ('EC add-on') is taken to  cover  any  identified  shortfalls  in  the  EC       .\n\n## Capital performance\n\nRWA and EC are also used to evaluate capital performance at a business level, as well as at transactional level in loan-pricing tools. These tools act as a decision-making mechanism for assessing the profitability of a new or existing transaction. Both ex-ante and ex-post performance are evaluated in terms of risk-adjusted return on equity (RAROE) with a risk-adjusted return on risk-adjusted capital (RARORAC) limit to safeguard sufficient risk-sensitivity. EC is used as an ingredient in RARORAC, whereas RWA is used in RAROE.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario analysis b\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO uses stress testing and scenario analysis as/uni00A0an/uni00A0important risk management instrument, looking at/uni00A0profitability, capital and liquidity from a bank-wide perspective in various scenarios on a regular basis. In/uni00A0addition, sub- portfolio and risk type-specific stress testing and scenario analysis are performed.\n\n## Stress testing purposes\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies stress testing and scenario analyses for/uni00A0several purposes, including:\n\n- H Business planning: various macroeconomic scenarios for/uni00A0budget purposes;\n- H Capital planning: stress testing is used to gain insight into the resilience of our capital under adverse changes in the economic environment and ABN/uni00A0AMRO-specific circumstances;\n- H Risk appetite setting and monitoring: the outcome of stress testing is used for setting and monitoring risk appetite limits and targets, including limits under stress;\n- H Contingency planning: stress testing is used to assess and strengthen the triggers and measures in the liquidity\n\n- and capital contingency and recovery plans. Reverse stress testing is performed to gain deeper/uni00A0insight into plausible events that could put the/uni00A0continuity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO under pressure;\n- H Risk type-specific and business line/uni00A0stress testing, such as market risk trading and banking book and mortgage stress testing;\n- H Supervisory stress testing, based on prescribed scenarios and assumptions. This includes the EBA's stress test programme designed to assess banks' resilience to adverse economic or financial developments.\n\nThe figure below shows the stress testing and scenario analysis cycle.\n\n## Stress test & scenario analysis cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe stress testing and scenario analysis cycle starts with the identification of material risks for ABN/uni00A0AMRO and individual business lines. Both systemic risks (e.g. macroeconomic risks) and ABN/uni00A0AMRO-specific risks (e.g. cyber attacks or adverse outcomes in legal proceedings) are considered. Scenario projections are based on quantitative models, as well as expert opinion procedures. In general, results are presented excluding and including potential mitigating  actions,  taking  into  account  contingency  plans       .\n\nGiven the importance of stress testing in terms of sound risk management, the Executive Committee is involved throughout the process and its governance. The Executive Committee, together with the Scenario & Stress Test Committee (SSC, a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee), discusses and decides on the scenario selection,  the  results  and  the  implications       .\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The primary responsibility for/uni00A0intake, managing and monitoring credit risk lies with the/uni00A0business as the first line of defence. The second line of/uni00A0defence has a permanent and ongoing responsibility\n\nto/uni00A0define the boundaries and monitor whether the type and/uni00A0level of credit risk exposures are within the limits of the business lines' risk appetite. Credit risk management within the bank is governed by the bank-wide central credit risk policy and further detailed in underlying specific credit risk policies and standards.\n\n## Credit risk management approach b\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO employs two separate approaches to managing credit risk. These reflect the bank's way of doing business. For customised lending to counterparties (non-programme lending), risks are assessed on an individual basis. Standardised products and processes are managed on a pooled basis (programme lending), to which uniform risk criteria are assigned. Effectively, any lending not specifically defined as programme lending is defined as nonprogramme lending.\n\nThe following figure presents a simplified overview of/uni00A0the/uni00A0credit risk management process.\n\n## Credit risk management process b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Daily monitoring or (semi-) annual credit review.\n- 2 'Watch': status assigned to counterparties with an increased risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more insight on our credit portfolio, please refer to Credit risk in the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Planning\n\nWithin programme lending, the credit cycle starts with a product planning phase, during which period the product is designed and/or reviewed. The goal of which is to optimise the key drivers of risk and return within the context of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategy, risk appetite, the client's best interests and sustainability.\n\n## Credit acceptance\n\nFor a credit approval decision within programme lending, client-specific aspects and internal and external data are/uni00A0taken into consideration to calculate a credit score (scorecard). The credit decision is based on the outcome of/uni00A0the scorecard and policy rules.\n\nWithin non-programme lending, the credit acceptance phase of a credit proposal starts with an assessment of the/uni00A0proposal by the relevant business line. The qualitative and quantitative details of the credit risk associated with the loan are assessed prior to approval. Information must be provided on matters such as the purpose, details and structure of the proposed credit facility, the borrower and/uni00A0other counterparties, the industry and geography, management/uni00A0and owners, and financial and non-financial analyses. Compliance with internal policies is checked. After/uni00A0the assessment, an analysis is performed by Risk Management. The credit decision is based on independent assessments by both the commercial and the credit risk/uni00A0functions.\n\n## Credit risk monitoring\n\nConsistent and regular monitoring of the counterparty, exposures, risk mitigants and ongoing compliance with internal policies helps to safeguard the bank's position in relation to all risks associated with the counterparty, credit type or portfolio. Monitoring starts when the credit facility is granted and continues throughout the lifecycle of the credit facility and the relationship with the counterparty until/uni00A0such time as the exposure is repaid and/or the limit is cancelled. During 2020, individual credit risk assessments were intensified to monitor the impact of Covid-19 and the low oil price environment on clients and to make sure that ending the payment holiday would not have unforeseen financial difficulties.\n\nIf a situation arises in which an individual counterparty shows signs of credit risk deterioration, but is not in default, a 'watch' status is assigned. A 'watch' status indicates that/uni00A0a counterparty is subject to increased monitoring and appropriate follow-up measures in order to prevent further deterioration or a default. Indicators for this status are changes in risk profile, liquidity problems, management issues, the market outlook, a potential breach of a credit agreement, solvency issues and uncertain continuity.\n\n## Restructuring & Recovery\n\nCredit facilities that are subject to a default event are mandatorily transferred to the Financial Restructuring & Recovery department (FR&R). Credit facilities identified as having a significantly high risk can be transferred to FR&R if/uni00A0specialised restructuring knowledge is required. If a 'going concern' approach is applicable and return to a performing status is considered likely, the credit facility is transferred to/uni00A0the Restructuring team, which will devise a plan aimed either at rehabilitation or at enhancing the likelihood of full repayment. In all other cases, the credit facility is transferred to the Recovery team.\n\nProgramme lending contracts are transferred to the Restructuring team if a default status is assigned because payments have been past due for more than 90 days or because another default trigger applies. If restructuring is/uni00A0ultimately ineffective, the client is transferred to other internal departments or external parties (such as Intrum) for/uni00A0debt collection.\n\nOnce a client is considered able to meet its future payment obligations and the involvement of FR&R is no longer required, the client is transferred back to the business line.\n\nFR&R plays a significant role in the execution of the bank's/uni00A0non-performing exposure (NPE) strategy. Policies on/uni00A0the management of NPE include valuation of collateral, monitoring of the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and ensuring this ratio remains well below the threshold of 5%. We have set NPE targets for each business segment and/uni00A0specific strategies for sectors with increased levels of/uni00A0non-performing loans. The definition of non-performing is/uni00A0similar to the definition of default and impaired. The differences are explained under 'Non-performing versus default and impaired'.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO primarily incurs counterparty credit risk (CCR) in two business activities, firstly within ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank through/uni00A0over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing transactions/uni00A0with other financial institutions (including positions taken to manage our interest rate hedging and liquidity position) and secondly in the business of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Clearing Bank. These two main sources of/uni00A0CCR are managed separately and are subject to various different features of risk management.\n\n## Credit concentration risk b\n\nCredit concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from large exposures, relative to the bank's total risk exposure, to/uni00A0a single counterparty or to counterparties that are positively and highly correlated./uni00A0As limiting excessive concentrations is fundamental to our credit risk strategy, we aim to keep the credit risk portfolio sufficiently granular and diversified.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "To avoid excessive credit risk concentrations, Risk/uni00A0Management sets maximum levels for subgroups in/uni00A0the following categories:\n\n- H Single counterparty and groups of related counterparties (counterparty concentration);\n- H Countries (geographic concentration);\n- H Industry sectors (industry concentration).\n\n## Counterparty concentration\n\nCounterparty concentration credit risk is the risk of loss arising from relatively large exposures to counterparties belonging to the same risk group. The One Obligor Exposure (OOE) is the exposure to a risk group and includes all drawn and undrawn credit facilities granted, plus all indirect exposure to the risk group, including guarantees and any other recourse claims. A risk group is an interrelated group of counterparties with a high degree of dependency on each other due to a control relationship. This control relationship may be due to direct or indirect majority interests being held by the same shareholder or group of shareholders. Counterparty credit concentration risk is measured by the OOE and the Economic Capital (EC) per counterparty. The bank limits its counterparty credit risk/uni00A0by setting OOE and EC limits. Additionally, all credit applications with an OOE and/or EC above a certain threshold are reviewed by the Executive Board.\n\n## Geographic concentration\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has branches and subsidiaries located outside/uni00A0the Netherlands, as well as clients who operate internationally. Consequently the bank is exposed to country risk, which is the risk of credit losses arising from/uni00A0country-specific events or circumstances. Under the new strategy for CIB announced in Q2 2020, geographical concentration continues to be relevant because we maintain a presence in multiple countries.\n\nManagement of country risk focuses on cross-border risk, which includes the risk that funds, goods or services cannot be transferred out of a country as a result of actions by local/uni00A0authorities in that country or other events. These risks are managed by setting country credit limits, based on individual country analyses by economic, compliance and country risk experts. Country limits are reviewed at least once a year. Each country also has an internal credit rating, which is reviewed and approved twice a year and is an important factor in managing country concentration risks. As the Netherlands is our home country, it is not included in/uni00A0any concentration risk appetite statement or setting of/uni00A0credit limits.\n\n## Industry concentration\n\nIndustry concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from a/uni00A0relatively large credit exposure to counterparties active in/uni00A0a single industry. Industry concentration risk arises when/uni00A0deterioration in a specific industry has an effect on\n\nall/uni00A0credit exposures relating to that industry. ABN/uni00A0AMRO manages its industry concentrations by setting limits on economic capital (EC) for credit risk for each industry as a/uni00A0percentage of total EC for credit risk. In addition to the EC/uni00A0limits, EC concentration checkpoints are set to facilitate timely and sufficient management interventions so as to/uni00A0avoid limits being breached.\n\n## Credit risk measurement b\n\nThe models used for the measurement and management of/uni00A0credit risk vary from purely statistical to expert-based models and employ both quantitative and qualitative risk drivers. All models are subject to the bank's model risk management framework. They undergo initial validation by/uni00A0the independent model validation function before their first use, and annually thereafter. Independent validation is also required when a model undergoes a material change.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nAll the models use a consistent definition of default, which has been specified to be in line with regulations. A default is deemed to have occurred when:\n\n- H the counterparty is past due by more than 90 days on any material financial credit obligation to the bank; or\n- H the bank considers the borrower to be unlikely to meet its contractual obligations (unlikely-to-pay or UTP).\n\nThe materiality of a financial obligation past due is assessed against an absolute and a relative threshold, in line with regulatory standards. To determine unlikeliness to pay, the bank has specified both mandatory default triggers (always resulting in the assignment of a default status and whereby no additional expert judgment is allowed) and judgmental triggers (requiring an assessment by credit risk managers to/uni00A0determine whether the UTP indications should result in/uni00A0a/uni00A0default classification).\n\nEnding of the default classification for non-forborne exposures is considered when none of the default triggers continues to apply and a (probation) cure period of at least three months has passed since the default trigger ceased to apply. For forborne exposures, a twelve-month cure period starts from the moment the last forbearance measure or/uni00A0default trigger was applied. After the cure period, an/uni00A0assessment is completed to establish whether the improvement in the credit quality is factual and permanent (including, for example, no remaining past due amounts).\n\n## Probability of default\n\nThe Probability of Default (PD) indicates the likelihood that a/uni00A0counterparty or exposure will default within a one-year time horizon. For the non-programme lending portfolio, the/uni00A0PD maps to and is expressed as an internal uniform counterparty rating (UCR). The UCR rating scale consists of/uni00A014 performing ratings, each representing a fixed PD range. The indicative mapping of the internal UCR rating\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

LGD is expressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount at default. On credit facilities that are not in default, LGD estimates are influenced by the risk mitigating techniques used by the bank (such as the use of collateral), the collateral cover, the credit facility's seniority and structure, and the bank's view of the creditor-friendliness of/uni00A0the relevant country's legal framework.\n\n## Exposure at default\n\nExposure at Default (EAD) models estimate the expected exposure at the time a counterparty defaults. If all or part/uni00A0of/uni00A0a facility is undrawn (i.e. the outstanding amount is/uni00A0less than the approved limit) at the time of the EAD calculation, a portion of the undrawn amount is added to/uni00A0the exposure to reflect the tendency of counterparties to/uni00A0utilise larger portions of their approved credit facilities when nearing default.\n\n## Capital for credit risk Regulatory capital\n\nFor the purpose of determining capital requirements for/uni00A0credit risk, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies the Advanced Internal Rating Based (A-IRB) approach to the vast majority of its portfolio. Under this approach, the previously described internal estimates for PD, EAD and LGD are used to calculate Credit Risk RWA. For a number of smaller portfolios, RWA is/uni00A0determined according to the Standardised Approach (SA).\n\nThis approach prescribes the risk weights to be applied to/uni00A0the exposure value in order to calculate RWA.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nThe EC model for credit risk uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine a full portfolio loss distribution, taking into account specific portfolio characteristics and diversification effects. Loan facilities are valued on an economic value (mark-to-market) basis to ensure that loss estimates can be/uni00A0based not only on defaulting borrowers, but also on possible credit migrations and changes associated with the/uni00A0market values of loans.\n\n## Credit quality and impairment b\n\nWe continuously monitor the credit portfolio for signs indicating that the counterparty may become credit impaired in the future. Loans at risk are classified into different risk categories for individual counterparties and/uni00A0into days-in-arrears buckets for groups of aggregated counterparties in order to optimise monitoring and review of these loans.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nForbearance is the process of making concessions to clients who are or will soon be experiencing financial difficulty, with the intention of bringing them back within their payment capacity. A forborne asset is any contract that/uni00A0has been entered into with a counterparty who is in/uni00A0or/uni00A0about to face financial difficulty, and that has been refinanced or modified on terms and conditions that we would not have accepted if the counterparty had been\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The cure period starts when the contract becomes non-performing or, if the contract was already non-performing, when the last forbearance measure was taken. More information about non-performing contracts can be found at the end of this section       .\n\n## Past due credit exposures\n\nA financial asset is past due if a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractually due date or if the counterparty has exceeded an agreed credit limit.

The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to financial assets measured at/uni00A0amortised cost or fair value through/uni00A0other comprehensive income (FVOCI), loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.

The LPD represents the likelihood that a counterparty will default during the lifetime of the financial instrument and depends on credit risk drivers such/uni00A0as:\n\n- H product characteristics (e.g. repayment and interest terms, term of the product);\n- H the financial condition of the borrower;\n- H the number of days past due;\n- H expected developments in the economy.\n\nThe lifetime PD (LPD) deterioration (LPDD) measures the/uni00A0relative difference between the remaining lifetime PD/uni00A0at/uni00A0reporting (LPDR) and the remaining lifetime PD at/uni00A0origination (LPDO) as LPDD = LPDR/LPDO. If the LPD deterioration of an exposure is above a predefined threshold, the LPD is considered to be significantly deteriorated, the exposure is transferred to/uni00A0stage 2 and impairment allowances equal to the lifetime/uni00A0expected credit loss are recognised. If the LPD deterioration subsequently reduces and falls below the threshold, the client is transferred back to stage 1. When determining the thresholds, ABN/uni00A0AMRO distinguishes between various portfolios within consumer lending, residential mortgages and corporate loans. A specific threshold is calculated for each portfolio, based on a statistical method. Due to limitations in the availability of historical data, ABN/uni00A0AMRO currently uses the 12-month PD/uni00A0as a proxy for LPD for consumer lending and corporate loans. We consider deterioration in the\n\n12-month PD to be/uni00A0appropriately representative of LPD deterioration for the/uni00A0portfolios where the LPD is not available. The table below shows LPD deterioration thresholds for transfers to/uni00A0stage 2 that were applied at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. The/uni00A0values shown represent the ratio between LPD at reporting and LPD at origination at/uni00A0which transfer to stage 2 is triggered. As thresholds are determined for each ECL model and each product class uses multiple ECL models, ranges are shown.\n\n## Range of PD deterioration thresholds b\n\n| Product class         | Range     |\n|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Consumer lending      | 3.1x-8.3x |\n| Residential mortgages | 1.2x-2.8x |\n| Corporate loans       | 1.7x-5.0x |\n\n## Qualitative stage triggers\n\nThe bank transfers a financial instrument from stage 1 to stage 2 if the instrument meets any one of the following qualitative triggers:\n\n- H Forborne status of a borrower;\n- H Watch status of a borrower. ABN/uni00A0AMRO assigns the/uni00A0watch status to counterparties with an increased credit risk. This process allows for intensive monitoring, early detection of deterioration in the credit portfolio and/uni00A0appropriate follow-up measures;\n- H The client has become non-performing (but is not in/uni00A0default);\n- H A delinquency-based regulatory backstop is in place, such/uni00A0that the credit risk of financial assets that are more/uni00A0than 30 days past due will be assumed to have significantly increased.\n\nTo account for the widespread impact of Covid-19 on credit risk, we temporarily added the industry sector of the client as an additional qualitative trigger for clients in Commercial Banking.

        "page_content": "capital review section. A transfer to stage 3 will always be the result of the default of a financial instrument. A default is considered to have occurred when one of the default triggers (e.g. unlikelihood of payment, distressed debt restructuring, bankruptcy or fraud) has occurred. Materiality thresholds are applied for counterparties transferring to stage 3 (relative threshold of 1% on the past due amount\n\ncompared to the on-balance sheet amount of the credit facility or product and an absolute threshold, with a minimum past due amount of EUR/uni00A0100 for/uni00A0programme lending or EUR/uni00A0500 for non-programme lending)./uni00A0These definitions are in line with the new definition of default introduced in the first half of 2020. Our definitions of default and impaired are aligned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFavourable changes in credit risk are recognised consistently with unfavourable changes in credit risk, except when applying a probation period for financial instruments that are/uni00A0forborne or more than 30 days past/uni00A0due.\n\n- H Forborne financial instruments are transferred back from stage 2 to stage 1 only after a/uni00A0probation/uni00A0period of at least two years has ended in line with the ABN/uni00A0AMRO forbearance policy. Stage 3 forborne instruments transfer back to stage 2 after a cure period of at least one year;\n- H For financial instruments that are 30 days past due, a three-month probation period is applied for transfers from stage 2 to stage 1.\n\n## Calculation method\n\nThe amount of expected credit loss allowances is based on the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining life of the financial instrument for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. ABN/uni00A0AMRO distinguishes between two types of calculation methods for/uni00A0credit loss allowances:\n\n- H Individual Lifetime ECL (LECL) for credit-impaired (stage/uni00A03) financial instruments with exposures above EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million;\n- H Collective 12-month ECL (stage 1) and LECL/uni00A0(stage 2 and/uni00A03) for/uni00A0financial instruments that have similar credit/uni00A0risk characteristics (e.g. residential mortgages,\n\nconsumer loans and SME loans) are clustered in portfolios and collectively assessed for impairment losses. A collective impairment calculation approach based on individual parameters is also applied to/uni00A0stage 3 exposures below EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has/uni00A0models to quantify the/uni00A0Probability of/uni00A0Loss (PL), Loss Given Loss (LGL) and/uni00A0Exposure at/uni00A0Loss (EAL) for the purpose of calculating the collective 12-month ECL and LECL for these financial/uni00A0instruments.\n\n## Lifetime expected credit loss\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO defines the lifetime of credit as the maximum contractual period during which the bank is exposed to credit risk and not a longer period, even if that longer period is consistent with business practice. For some contracts, such as overdraft facilities or credit cards, no end date is specified or amounts can be contractually withdrawn by the/uni00A0lender at short notice. In/uni00A0these cases, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses/uni00A0behavioural maturity models that rely on historical client behaviour to determine future expected exposures.\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nFor expected credit loss calculations, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses/uni00A0three different scenarios of future economic developments: a baseline (or most likely) scenario, negative scenario and a positive scenario.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement Additional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The three scenarios are incorporated into the expected credit loss calculation and risk stage determination in a probability-weighted manner. In order to/uni00A0incorporate the latest economic outlook (including the macroeconomic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic), the scenarios and their weights are reviewed each quarter and adjusted if necessary. Details of the scenarios and their/uni00A0weights used in the reporting period can be found in Credit risk in the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\nThe baseline scenario is based on Group Economics' regular macroeconomic forecasts and is reviewed at each reporting date. The Group Economics analysts consider a range of external sources in order to develop the forecasts for the different macroeconomic variables (MEVs) required, including GDP, the unemployment rate, the housing price index, oil prices and 3-month Euribor. They check their views and assumptions against external views and assumptions. The preliminary forecasts for the/uni00A0different countries undergo a challenge process to/uni00A0ensure they are reasonable and consistent. To reduce the risk of biased forecasts, the final MEVs are again checked against external forecasts and then/uni00A0submitted to the Scenario and Stress-testing Committee for approval.\n\nBoth alternative scenarios reflect the lower and upper levels for the different macroeconomic variables, whereby the whole range is meant to cover roughly 85% of the/uni00A0possible economic future. For most MEVs, Group Economics uses its standard deviations. These are calculated on the basis of/uni00A0realised figures in the past few/uni00A0decades. The extent to which MEVs actually deviate over time from their historical means reflects the past materialisation of negative and positive risks in the economy. A probability of about 85% roughly corresponds to a standard deviation of plus and minus one and a half.\n\nFor the purpose of scenario analysis, the forecasts period is/uni00A0five years. It is assumed that MEVs gradually move to/uni00A0their potential or equilibrium values after the second year. For each specific portfolio, a selection of variables is/uni00A0made for calculating the expected credit loss, based on  statistical  relevance  and  expert  judgment.\n\n## Non-performing versus default and impaired\n\nDefinitions for default and impaired are aligned and form/uni00A0the basis for most credit risk reporting in this report. For specific reporting purposes ABN/uni00A0AMRO also distinguishes between performing and non-performing exposures. The/uni00A0criteria for non-performing exposures are/uni00A0broader than/uni00A0those applying to default or impaired.\n\nAn exposure is qualified as non-performing if:\n\n- H the counterparty is in default; or\n- H the counterparty is no longer in default, but\n\nhas/uni00A0received/uni00A0an additional forbearance measure, or/uni00A0became/uni00A0more than 30 days past due/uni00A0during the/uni00A0forborne probation period\n\nAn exposure is categorised as non-performing for the entire/uni00A0amount, taking no account of any available collateral, and including the following revocable and irrevocable off-balance sheet items:\n\n- H loan commitments;\n- H financial guarantees at risk of being called, including the/uni00A0underlying guaranteed exposure that meets the criteria of non-performing;\n- H any other financial commitments.\n\nThe non-performing classification typically ends when the counterparty is no longer in default and the cure period has/uni00A0ended. For non-performing exposures that are/uni00A0not in default, a cure period of at least 12 months applies from the/uni00A0date the exposure became nonperforming. After this 12-month period, an assessment is/uni00A0made to establish whether the improvement of the/uni00A0credit quality is factual and permanent (including a requirement for no past due amounts). This is comparable to the out-of-default assessment.\n\nIn monetary terms, the difference between nonperforming and default or impaired amounts to less than/uni00A05% of total non-performing exposure.\n\n## Cured financial assets\n\nWhen a credit impaired financial asset cures, the interest/uni00A0that was previously unrecognised is reported as/uni00A0an impairment release in the impairment charge rather than as/uni00A0a credit to the interest income calculated using the effective interest method.\n\n## Write-off\n\nA loan is written off against the related loan loss allowance if the likelihood of repayment falls below a/uni00A0certain point or the financial asset reaches a certain stage of delinquency.\n\n- H For non-programme lending, a write-off must be taken/uni00A0if/uni00A0all possible means of recovery have been exhausted and it has become clear that there is a low/uni00A0probability of/uni00A0recovering the debt, either in part or/uni00A0full.\n- H Most of the programme lending facilities are automatically written-off after 1,080 days in default.\n\nSuch loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the/uni00A0loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of/uni00A0amounts previously written off are credited to impairment charges on financial instruments in the income statement.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk mitigation\n\nCredit risk mitigation techniques are used by the bank to reduce the credit risk associated with its credit exposures. Such techniques relate mainly to collateral management and guarantees, offsetting financial assets and liabilities, and enforcing master netting agreements or similar instruments.\n\nCredit risk mitigation techniques themselves entail risks and, as such, have to meet certain requirements so that they can be used effectively and in line with the bank's risk appetite. For this reason, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has established mandatory, bank-wide policies governing the use and management of credit risk mitigation techniques. These are in line with regulatory requirements, as well as with the needs of the bank and its clients. These bank-wide policies provide the overarching rules to be met by business-specific procedures and processes related to credit risk mitigation.\n\n## Collateral management and guarantees\n\nCollateral and guarantees represent assets with material value that have been received by (or pledged to) the bank to/uni00A0secure obligations under a credit facility or other exposure. To be effective, such security must give the bank the right to appropriate and liquidate collateral on time and without impediment so that losses on the exposure at default are/uni00A0minimised.\n\nIn addition to minimising exposure risk, eligible collateral and guarantees can also reduce the regulatory and economic capital the bank is required to hold as a buffer for unexpected losses. The Capital Requirements Regulation prescribes the criteria that collateral must meet to become eligible for capital reduction. These criteria, which provide for legal effectiveness and for the enforceability, valuation and monitoring of collateral, are aimed at the effective and/uni00A0timely realisation of collateral.\n\n## Accounting policy for offsetting financial assets and/uni00A0liabilities b\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported on the EU IFRS balance sheet, if/uni00A0there/uni00A0is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention either to/uni00A0settle on a/uni00A0net/uni00A0basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The bank applies netting to debtor and creditor balances, such as current accounts, where offsetting is justified by formal agreement with the client, provided they meet the applicable criteria.\n\n## Accounting policy for enforceable master netting agreements or similar instruments b\n\nEnforceable master netting arrangements take into account all agreements containing conditions that allow offsetting in the event of default. In addition, agreements are enforceable if the bank has a legally enforceable right/uni00A0to offset and no ability and/or intention to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. These arrangements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements and global master securities lending agreements.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market risk in/uni00A0the banking book consists predominantly of interest rate/uni00A0risk and credit spread risk in the liquidity portfolio. Funding spread risk, foreign exchange risk, equity risk and property risk are also recognised as market risks in the banking book. However, these are relatively immaterial.\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of losses in the economic value of equity or the bank's net interest income (NII) due to unfavourable yield curve developments, including changes in the volatility of the yield curve. In order to model and measure interest rate risk, assumptions on client behaviour are made, most importantly with respect to the maturity of savings and the prepayment of mortgages. These assumptions influence the anticipated interest cash flow pattern. Interest rate risk is continuously managed in line with the risk appetite as the profile of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet can change if client behaviour changes.\n\nThe main sources of interest rate risk are:\n\n- H The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. ABN/uni00A0AMRO provides mortgages and commercial loans with fixed interest terms. These assets are funded by non-maturing deposits and wholesale funding with a/uni00A0shorter average interest maturity than the assets;\n- H Client behaviour, which determines the maturity profile of some of our products. As we use models to predict this behaviour, we are exposed to model risk.\n\n## Key assumptions for modelling client behaviour\n\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, the following aspects of client behaviour are the most important:\n\n- H Client behaviour with respect to early redemption of residential mortgages. This has a significant impact on the average interest maturity of the mortgage portfolio. Clients have the option to fully or partially prepay mortgages before maturity. Prepayments can be triggered by, for example, relocation, redemption or curtailment. An important driver of prepayments is the interest rate incentive, i.e. the difference between a client's current mortgage rate and prevailing mortgage rates. Future mortgage rates are simulated using a Monte Carlo approach. In addition to/uni00A0the interest rate incentive, other drivers such as loan\n\nage, seasonality and/uni00A0house price developments are also taken into account;\n\n- H Client acceptance of the volume offered and the deviation between the offered rate and the actual coupon on an offered residential mortgage;\n- H Client behaviour with respect to non-maturing deposits that are callable on demand. Future client rates for savings and current accounts are modelled using a replicating portfolio model. Modelled client rates depend on current or lagged yield curves and funding costs. A maximum maturity of 10 years is assumed. The resulting duration depends on product type and client behaviour. The average duration for retail portfolios is around 3 years, well below the requlatory 5-year cap.\n\nThe metrics used for market risk in the banking book are dependent upon the assumptions made in the behavioural models. Models must therefore be based on extensive research, including historical data on observed client behaviour. Models must be independently validated and approved by the mandated risk committees. Models are periodically assessed to determine whether they behave appropriately and are statistically sound; if required, they are adjusted.\n\n## Risk measurement for interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by net interest income (NII) at risk, present value of 1 basis point (PV01), economic value of equity (EVE) at risk and economic capital for market risk in the banking book.\n\nEconomic capital for market risk in the banking book is calculated using a parametric Monte Carlo simulation model that determines the economic capital needed to absorb losses due to adverse movements in interest rates, client behaviour for mortgages and non-maturing deposits, volatility, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.\n\nThese metrics are complemented with stress testing and scenario analysis, which are used to ensure a comprehensive approach to risk management and to identify potential weaknesses. Stress testing and scenario analyses go beyond determining the impact of alternative developments of interest rates. Assumptions with respect to modelling and/uni00A0client behaviour are also tested. A combination of market/uni00A0and product floors is applied. These floors are reviewed periodically.\n\nFor management purposes, the interest rate risk position is/uni00A0monitored by the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) on/uni00A0a monthly basis. The above metrics are also regularly reported to the Executive Board.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Credit spread risk in the banking book\n\nCredit spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse movements in the credit spread of assets. The main source is from bonds held for liquidity purposes. It is measured as the impact on economic value of a 1bp change in spreads to a swap rate. The sensitivity is measured for individual term points, as well as for a parallel shift of the curve.\n\n## Funding spread risk\n\nFunding spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse movements in the term structure of rates at which ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0can fund itself - expressed as a spread to a/uni00A0benchmark such as Euribor. Funding spread movements can arise due to changes in, for example, the perceived credit quality of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, changes in the competitive environment or changes in liquidity premiums. They may be/uni00A0entity-specific or systemic in nature. If funding spreads widen, it costs more to fund assets on the balance sheet. Unless this increased spread is passed on to clients by increasing client rates, projected net interest income will decrease. The funding spread risk is measured using an NII-at-risk approach whereby the funding spread increases.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange (FX) risk is the risk arising from adverse movements in FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility. It is managed within the bank by ALM and Treasury. As a general rule, foreign exchange risk is hedged by using cross-currency swaps to swap the exposure in foreign currency to EUR. If, for operational reasons, it is inefficient to hedge exposures in foreign currencies,/uni00A0an open currency position (OCP) remains. This is measured by/uni00A0the aggregated net position per currency, except for EUR. The OCP is monitored regularly, and limits apply on a local and aggregate level. Both for assets and for liabilities, USD/uni00A0is the largest non-EUR/uni00A0exposure.\n\n## Market risk management for the banking book\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has a detailed risk management framework in/uni00A0place to identify, measure and control market risk in the banking book. This framework provides assurance that the banking book activities remain consistent with the bank's strategy to pursue a moderate risk profile. The day-to-day management is delegated from the Asset & Liability Committee to Asset and Liability Management, while Treasury is responsible for the execution of hedge transactions. These departments form the first line of defence. Market & ALM/T Risk acts as the second line of/uni00A0defence.\n\nThe risk appetite is articulated in terms of net interest income, the economic value of equity and the economic capital for market risk in the banking book, and expresses the maximum loss the bank is willing to accept. The risk appetite is cascaded into a limit framework.\n\nTo manage the interest rate sensitivity in the banking book and keep in line with the bank's strategy and risk appetite, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro) hedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges to swap fixed interest rates for floating interest rate positions. Micro hedges are used to swap fixed funding transactions and fixed investments in the liquidity buffer for floating interest rate positions. In addition, macro hedging is applied in order to align with the bank's strategy to contribute to a stable NII while protecting the economic value of equity.\n\n## Market risk in the trading book\n\nPositions held with trading intent and hedges for positions held with trading intent must be included in the bank's trading book. The Central Trading Risk policy describes the positions included in the trading book and the criteria for transferring risk and positions between the trading and banking books. As part of its business strategy, ABN/uni00A0AMRO facilitates client orders, acts as a market maker in key markets and provides liquidity to clients, including institutional investors and private clients. Market risk in the trading book is the risk of losses in market value due to adverse market movements. The following market risks are inherent in the trading book:\n\n- H Interest rate risk, arising/uni00A0from adverse changes in interest rate risk curves and/or interest rate volatilities;\n- H Credit spread risk,/uni00A0arising/uni00A0from adverse changes in the term structure of credit spreads and/or from changing credit quality of debt securities or CDS reference entities, with an impact on default probabilities;\n- H Equity risk,/uni00A0arising/uni00A0from adverse changes in equity prices, dividends and volatilities;\n- H Commodity risk,/uni00A0arising/uni00A0from adverse changes in commodity prices;\n- H Foreign exchange risk,/uni00A0arising/uni00A0from adverse changes in/uni00A0FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility.\n\n## Market risk measurement for the trading book b\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO measures and manages market risk in the trading book on a daily basis. The key metrics used are economic capital, regulatory capital, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), together with a wide array of stress and scenario tests, sensitivity measures, concentration limits and notional limits. These metrics are measured and monitored on a daily basis. Appropriate limits are set at bank level in the Risk Appetite Statement and at bank and business-line levels in the limit framework, in line with the general risk principles in the Central Trading Risk policy.\n\nMetrics and models are managed, reviewed, assessed and, if required, adjusted in a similar way as in the banking book. Other important tools to ensure the adequacy of the models, alongside the formal validation and review of models, are/uni00A0the daily explanation of risk reporting figures, periodic portfolio reviews and regular back-testing./uni00A0\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This policy requires that model assumptions and limitations are documented and independently validated by Model Validation. For material changes, the regulator performs an onsite investigation before such a model change is applied in production.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nThe calculation of economic capital for market risk in the trading book is based on a daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) market risk measure and historical scenarios simulating stress events such as 'Black Monday' and the financial markets crisis.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario analysis\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are designed to focus specifically on the impact of tail events that are outside the VaR confidence interval. We perform daily stress tests for large movements in risk factors. Scenario analyses are also conducted frequently to evaluate the impacts of extreme market events that cover multiple risk factors, and the results of these tests are monitored. These scenarios can be based on historical or hypothetical events, or on a combination of the two.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nFor each risk type sensitivities are monitored against limits.

In accordance with the strategy, the Business Risk Committee Trading annually approves trading mandates, which define the nature and amount of the permitted transactions and risks,/uni00A0and the associated constraints. The Business Risk Committee Trading is a subsidiary committee of the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Valuation adjustments\n\nFor the trading book, we take into account adjustments for counterparty risk on our clients (Credit Valuation Adjustment), ABN/uni00A0AMRO funding costs (Funding Valuation Adjustment) and ABN/uni00A0AMRO credit risk (Debt Valuation Adjustment).\n\nTrading book positions are subject to prudent valuation standards in accordance with regulatory requirements.

This definition is in line with the definition by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Operational risk covers multiple non-financial risks, such as HR risk, IT risk, compliance risk, legal risk, change risk, tax risk and model risk.\n\n## Operational risk management approach\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has a converged approach to operational risk management, providing the business with a clear and fair view on the operational risks that the bank faces and the way these should be managed. For this purpose, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has in place a framework that enables operational risks to be managed within the moderate risk profile. The Information and Operational Risk Management (I&ORM) department sets this framework for the bank in line with the requirements of/uni00A0the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA). This framework evolves and is kept current as experience gained/uni00A0is incorporated. The main components of the framework are schematically shown in the following figure.\n\n## Framework for operational risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's operational risk management framework is/uni00A0supported by the three lines of defence (3LoD) model. Our Vision for 3LoD is as follows:\n\nWe achieve ABN/uni00A0AMRO's purpose of 'Banking for better, for/uni00A0generations to come' by organising 3LoD to deliver on our strategic priorities, secure the continuity of our bank, remain within our risk appetite and maintain our licence to/uni00A0operate. We are clear on each other's responsibilities and/uni00A0use a common language to communicate an integrated, transparent and consistent approach to managing our risks/uni00A0with the common goal of taking better decisions for/uni00A0all/uni00A0stakeholders.\n\nThe division and clarity in roles and responsibilities across the three lines of defence reflect the bank's view that managing operational risk requires a concerted effort from all. Operational risk views are provided in risk reports at various levels within the bank, up to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board.\n\n## Framework for operational risk management\n\nRisk identification, assessments, response and monitoring activities are at the heart of our operational risk management framework. Despite preventive measures being in place, incidents and operational losses are inherent to our business. ABN/uni00A0AMRO systematically tracks and analyses such events in order to learn from them and use them as early warnings. Together with scanning external developments, emerging risks can also be identified for further assessment. Key/uni00A0Risk/uni00A0Indicators (KRIs) are monitored to signal adverse risk developments.\n\nBusiness managers perform assessments to identify and/uni00A0assess risks, including scenarios for rare events. Assessments are executed for business-as-usual activities and for new initiatives and provide support by creating risk awareness throughout the organisation. If a risk exceeds or/uni00A0is predicted to be outside the risk appetite, the business manager takes appropriate action. Actions may include strengthening controls.\n\nAt least once a year, business managers monitor the effectiveness of the controls in their areas of responsibility and update them as necessary. Management may also decide to avoid risks by ceasing certain operations, consciously accept a certain risk or transfer a risk to insurance companies. With respect to the latter option, the global insurance programme in place is reviewed annually by the Group Risk/uni00A0Committee.\n\nOnce a year, senior management also reviews the strategic business objectives and the measures taken from/uni00A0a risk/uni00A0perspective. At the end of each year, based on the/uni00A0effectiveness of the control environment and on the/uni00A0strategic risk outlook, senior management signs a\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Management Control Statement (MCS), which is included directly after the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\n## Specific operational risk areas\n\nThe bank has in place a dedicated organisation for operational risk areas that require specific knowledge, such/uni00A0as compliance risk,/uni00A0information security, business continuity management and model risk management.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nCompliance risk is defined as the risk of failure to comply with legislation and regulations, self-regulatory organisational standards, values and business principles, and codes of conduct or generally accepted market standards applicable to the bank's services and activities. It can result in security risks and incidents and in financial and reputational damage arising from financial or other crime and misconduct or illegal conduct on the part of clients, the bank or its employees.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has to live up to continuing regulatory expectations and mitigate their compliance risk. It is expected to act as a gatekeeper in detecting financial and economic crime, and to fulfil obligations arising under its duty of care to clients and society. Increasing amounts of resources are therefore devoted to the various investigations and inquiries taking place, as well as to ensuring focused governance and to improving the risk and control framework.\n\n## Information security/uni00A0\n\nInformation is one of the bank's most valuable assets.\n\nOur/uni00A0clients rely increasingly on digitalisation and online banking, even more so during the Covid-19 outbreak. This/uni00A0means proper functioning of the bank's IT systems is/uni00A0crucial. These systems run in complex information infrastructures, connecting the bank's networks to public networks. Banking processes and their supporting information systems are therefore inherently vulnerable, with threats to the security of client data and services. Examples of such threats include social engineering and phishing, computer-assisted fraud, unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, virus infections and ransomware, and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS).\n\nIn recognition of the vital importance of protecting its information, systems and infrastructure at all times, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has established a structured IT risk management approach to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. This approach defines the organisational framework, management and/uni00A0staff responsibilities, and the information security directives that apply to ABN/uni00A0AMRO, its vendors and third parties with whom the bank exchanges information.\n\n## Business continuity management/uni00A0\n\nBusiness continuity management (BCM) ensures organisational resilience at all levels of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. It/uni00A0focuses on setting up and maintaining ABN/uni00A0AMRO's\n\ncrisis/uni00A0management capability (i.e., framework, process, tooling, people) to enable the organisation to remain well-prepared and able to respond in a controlled and effective crisis mode in the face of severe threats and calamities such as the current Covid-19 outbreak./uni00A0Our key tasks include the following:\n\n- H Analysing threats and the business impact of calamities and crises;\n- H Determining the strategies and solutions to be applied in/uni00A0the event of a crisis/uni00A0-/uni00A0such as business recovery, crisis/uni00A0management and IT disaster recovery planning -/uni00A0so as to enable continuity of business operations;\n- H Documenting, periodically assessing and testing of these strategies and solutions.\n\n## Model risk management\n\nModels are developed and used to quantify the risk for most risk types in the risk taxonomy. We define model risk as the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect output of models, due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models. This/uni00A0definition is in line with the definition in the EU Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). To monitor and mitigate risks arising from the use of these models, the/uni00A0model risk management department functions as the second line of/uni00A0defence. As an independent department it sets the framework for the bank in line with regulatory requirements on model risk and independently validates models before they can be used. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has separate model validation standards and procedures in place for this purpose as part of the model risk management framework.\n\n## Operational risk measurement\n\nIn line with the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), the bank has in place an internally developed model to/uni00A0define the required own funds for operational risk (i.e./uni00A0operational risk capital). The AMA model estimates potential operational risk losses (annually aggregated) by/uni00A0combining forward-looking and backward-looking views/uni00A0on operational risk events.\n\nRisk self-assessments and scenario analyses provide a forward-looking view. Experts use these tools to build scenarios to evaluate future risks and estimate the severity of potential losses that could occur. The resulting estimates are used as data input for the model. In these scenarios, experts take into consideration the quality of the bank's control environment, its processes, systems and people, as/uni00A0well as external circumstances and changes that may have an influence. The ongoing relevance of the estimations (and hence of the capital) is safeguarded by reviewing the/uni00A0scenarios at regular intervals, as well as when major changes occur in the risk profile.\n\nAlongside these expert-based estimations, the model also uses historical loss data from ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the banking industry.

        "page_content": "## Funding & liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that actual and potential payments or collateral posting obligations cannot be met on a timely basis, or only at excessive costs. There are two types of liquidity risk:\n\n- H Funding liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to accommodate both expected and unexpected current and future cash outflows and collateral needs because insufficient cash is available. Eventually, this can affect the bank's daily operations or its financial condition;\n- H Market liquidity risk is the risk that the bank cannot/uni00A0sell an asset in a timely manner at a reasonable market/uni00A0price due to insufficient market depth (insufficient/uni00A0supply and demand) or market disruption. Market/uni00A0liquidity risk includes the sensitivity in liquidity value/uni00A0of a portfolio due/uni00A0to changes in the applicable haircuts/uni00A0and market value. It also concerns uncertainty about the/uni00A0time required to realise the liquidity value of the assets.\n\n## Strategy Liquidity\n\nWe have a liquidity risk management framework in place that helps us maintain a moderate risk profile and safeguards the bank's reputation from a liquidity perspective. This framework enables the bank to meet the regulatory requirements and its payment obligations at a reasonable cost, even under severely adverse conditions. We have formulated a set of liquidity risk metrics and limits to manage the bank's liquidity position. By maintaining a smooth long-term maturity profile, limiting dependence on/uni00A0wholesale funding and holding a solid liquidity buffer in our main currencies, we maintain a prudent liquidity profile. The bank's liquidity position is monitored on a daily basis.\n\n## Funding\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's main source of funding consists of deposits from Retail Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking and CIB clients. The remainder of our funding is raised largely through various long-term wholesale funding instruments. In the short-term, funding is raised via commercial paper./uni00A0The wholesale funding strategy is aligned to the moderate risk profile. This strategy aims to optimise and diversify the bank's funding sources in order to maintain market access and the targeted funding position. We aim to/uni00A0have a balance sheet with a diverse, stable and costefficient funding base.\n\nThe funding strategy takes the following guidelines into/uni00A0account:\n\n- H Maintain market access by diversifying funding sources in different funding markets (Europe, the US and the Asia-Pacific region);\n- H Continually monitor attractive funding opportunities and/uni00A0maintain strong relationships with the investor base through active marketing;\n- H Optimise the balance between private placements and/uni00A0public benchmark deals;\n- H Optimise funding costs within the targets set for volumes and maturities and manage/uni00A0credit curves in/uni00A0different/uni00A0funding programmes and currencies;\n- H Optimise the planning and execution of funding in/uni00A0different market windows and currencies.\n\n## Risk management approach b\n\nThe natural maturity mismatch between loans and funding requires liquidity risk management. We consider maturity transformation to be an integral part of the bank's business model, which is why we closely monitor our liquidity position and the resulting risks. We diversify our funding sources to maintain market access, and we diversify funding tenors to avoid a concentration of outflows. We/uni00A0also hold a portfolio of highly liquid assets that/uni00A0can be/uni00A0converted into cash in the event of unforeseen market disruptions, thus allowing us to meet payment and collateral obligations at all times.\n\nFunding and liquidity risk is managed centrally. We incorporate liquidity costs into the pricing of our day-to-day business activities./uni00A0\n\nIn managing the risks, a clear distinction is made between going-concern and contingency risk management.\n\n## Going-concern management\n\nGoing-concern management entails management of the day-to-day liquidity position within specified limits. This allows us to meet payment obligations on a timely basis. The most important metrics we use are:\n\n- H Stress testing: We conduct monthly and ad hoc stress tests in which we evaluate the impact of cash in- and outflows under plausible stress scenarios. Both marketwide and bank-specific stress scenarios are defined and analysed. The goal of stress testing is twofold. Firstly, it helps us to review our risk framework, i.e. the liquidity buffer size, risk appetite and limits. Secondly, it allows us/uni00A0to identify ways to reduce outflows in times of crisis;\n- H Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): The objective of the/uni00A0LCR is to assess the bank's short-term resilience by/uni00A0ensuring sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive/uni00A0a significant stress scenario lasting 30 calendar days;\n- H Survival period: The survival period reflects the period that the bank's liquidity position is expected to remain positive in an internal stress scenario in which wholesale funding markets deteriorate and retail and commercial clients withdraw a proportion of their deposits;\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

We/uni00A0monitor/uni00A0these potential additional collateral postings in the/uni00A0liquidity management framework;\n- H Liquidity buffer: We hold a liquidity buffer/uni00A0to accommodate cash outflows during stress.

        "page_content": "## Capital management\n\n## Capital management strategy\n\nThe primary objective of the capital management strategy is to ensure that capital adequacy requirements are met at all times and that sufficient capital is available to support the bank's strategy. Capital is a necessary resource for doing business and defines the bank's commercial possibilities. The balance between available and required capital is managed centrally to optimise the use of available capital. The basis of the capital management strategy is the bank's risk appetite and its business plans./uni00A0Other important factors taken into account when managing the capital position are expectations and/uni00A0requirements of external stakeholders (such as regulators, investors, shareholders, equity analysts, rating agencies and clients), the bank's position in the market, market developments, contingent capital needs and the feasibility of capital management actions. Although ABN/uni00A0AMRO manages its capital centrally, the group companies are sufficiently capitalised to comply with all local regulatory solvency requirements and to meet any local business needs. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's banking activities are carried out/uni00A0by legal entities that are part of the bank's corporate tax unit. Apart from prevailing statutory and regulatory legislation, there are no specific material impediments for prompt transfer of the bank's regulatory capital.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend policy takes into account/uni00A0matters including current and pending regulatory capital/uni00A0requirements, our risk profile, growth in commercial/uni00A0activities and market factors. The dividend payout is set in/uni00A0the light of the bank's moderate risk profile and regulatory/uni00A0changes and to ensure that dividend payments can be/uni00A0maintained in the future.\n\nFrom 2018 onwards, the dividend payout policy was set at/uni00A050% of net sustainable profit attributable to owners of/uni00A0the/uni00A0parent company, excluding exceptional items that significantly distorted profitability and excluding AT1 capital securities. Additional distributions of above 50%, which could be either special dividends or share buy-backs (subject to regulatory approval), were considered if capital was within or above the Basel III target range of 17.5-18.5% and were also subject to other circumstances, including regulatory and commercial considerations. The combined distribution was at least 50% of net sustainable profit.\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, the dividend payout has been set at 50% of reported net profit, after deduction of AT1 coupon payments and minority interests. Interim dividends will be considered at 40% of the reported H1 net profit, provided profit is expected to be sustainable throughout the year, at/uni00A0the discretion of the Board./uni00A0\n\nWe have updated our CET1 capital target ratio to 13% under Basel IV. When our Basel IV CET1 ratio is above the/uni00A0threshold of 15%, we will consider share buy-backs, subject to conditions and regulatory approval. Our threshold of 15% reflects current uncertainties, as well as/uni00A0a buffer for/uni00A0potential M&A. We intend to review the/uni00A0threshold when/uni00A0current uncertainties have reduced. Buy-backs will/uni00A0not be considered before the end of 2021.\n\nAny distribution of dividend remains discretionary, and ABN/uni00A0AMRO may propose deviations from the above policy./uni00A0\n\n## Capital measurement and allocation\n\nCapital adequacy is measured and monitored on an/uni00A0ongoing basis against target capital ratios, which are/uni00A0derived from the bank's overall risk appetite and strategy./uni00A0Capital projections and stress test scenarios, both market-wide/uni00A0and bankspecific, are used to ensure that actual/uni00A0and future capital levels remain above the targets./uni00A0Capital is allocated to businesses in a way that optimises/uni00A0the long-term value of/uni00A0the bank while serving the bank's/uni00A0strategic objectives. In/uni00A0the capital allocation process,/uni00A0both risk-based and non-risk-based return parameters are/uni00A0considered, taking into account economic and regulatory/uni00A0capital requirements. This process ensures that the bank/uni00A0meets its return targets while maintaining a moderate risk/uni00A0profile in line with its risk/uni00A0appetite.\n\n## Contingency capital management\n\nContingency plans are in place to address any capital issues arising. The Contingency Capital Plan provides a framework to detect capital adequacy stress by setting out various early warning indicators. The plan also sets out a range of/uni00A0actions that can be undertaken, based on the level of/uni00A0severity and urgency of the issues.\n\n## Recovery and resolution planning\n\nThe Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive requires a/uni00A0recovery plan and a resolution plan to be in place. ABN/uni00A0AMRO submitted a reviewed and/uni00A0updated version of/uni00A0its bank recovery plan to the ECB/uni00A0in/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. The/uni00A0Single Resolution Board (SRB)/uni00A0has prepared a resolution plan, in which it/uni00A0concluded that the preferred resolution strategy/uni00A0is a Single-Point-of-Entry strategy,/uni00A0with ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. as the resolution entity.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Business risk management\n\nBusiness Risk is the risk that business earnings and franchise value will decline and/or deviate from expectations because of uncertainty in business income or in the expenses needing to be incurred to generate business income. ABN/uni00A0AMRO manages business risk by seeking to minimise the effect of/uni00A0unexpected internal and/or external developments.\n\nThe key criteria for classifying a risk as a business risk are:\n\n- H An unexpected event that leads to uncertainty in present or future business earnings and/or franchise value;\n- H Changes of drivers of future business earnings such as uncertainty in volumes, margins, fee and commission rates and/or business expenses.\n\nEarnings are affected by various internal and external factors, such as changes in client preferences, competition and regulation. In addition, earnings are affected by technical, societal, geopolitical and economic developments, such as/uni00A0the outbreak of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns. When assessing the pressure from external factors contributing to an increase or decrease in the business risk, at least the following elements are considered:\n\n- H The key macroeconomic variables within which the bank operates or will operate based on its main geographies. Examples of key variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates and/uni00A0house price indices;\n- H The competitive landscape and how it is likely to evolve, considering the activities of the bank's peers;\n- H Expected growth in target markets, and the activities and plans of key competitors in these target markets;\n- H Overall trends in the market that may have an impact on/uni00A0performance and profitability. This should include, as/uni00A0a/uni00A0minimum, regulatory trends, technological trends and societal/demographic trends;\n- H The contamination effects that risks may have on other risk types, and/uni00A0risks downstream/uni00A0or upstream in client supply chains that may cause/uni00A0domino effects (this includes the impact of Covid-19).\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO continually monitors and responds to the key\n\nexternal and internal factors and elements within these factors. The disclosure and monitoring of the business risk drivers is based, among other things, on the ERM report. The bank mitigates sensitivity to business risk drivers through discussions at senior management and board level that address developments in these drivers in an effective and timely manner. Business risk is also included in the/uni00A0capital buffer that is meant to safeguard our position in/uni00A0the case of extreme events.\n\nThe bank's strategy and business risk are related. The strategy incorporates mitigation of unexpected events and/uni00A0changes in business risk drivers. Regular review of the strategy ensures alignment with developments in business risk. To ensure that the bank's strategy is pursued and the long-term strategic goals (financial and non-financial) are met, our business plans and budgets take these strategic goals into account.\n\n## Economic capital for business risk\n\nEconomic capital is used to mitigate the negative effects of/uni00A0unexpected business risk events. The economic capital for business risk reflects the maximum downward deviation of actual versus expected net operating profit in one year, excluding any impact already covered by other risk types (e.g. impairments for credit risk).\n\nTo determine the economic capital for business risk, a/uni00A0combination of historical and forward-looking scenarios is/uni00A0collected from experts in each business line and from Group Economics. These scenarios determine the sensitivity of macroeconomic variables or industry performance indicators to the business lines' income. This sensitivity is used to determine the volatility of income for each business line, as well as any correlation between business lines. Based on the individual volatilities, we use simulation to/uni00A0calculate bank-wide volatility.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

We manage these sustainability risks in line with the bank's moderate risk profile. Sustainability risk management also goes hand in hand with the bank's sustainability strategy to support our clients' transition and accelerate the sustainability shift.\n\nWe define sustainability risk as the potential impact of ESG issues on the earnings and value of the bank. In line with regulatory and societal expectations we consider two sides:\n\n- H Inside-out risk: the impact of the bank and its clients on ESG in the form, for example, of greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and human rights infringements;\n- H Outside-in risk: the impact of ESG issues on the bank and its clients in the form, for example, of/uni00A0physical risks of global warming,/uni00A0biodiversity loss/uni00A0and transition risks.\n\nSustainability risk is a driver of other risk types, such as credit risk, market risk and business risk. It can materialise in the short term (directly), the medium term (1-5 years) and/uni00A0the long term (5-30 years).\n\n## Sustainability risk policy framework\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies a sustainability risk policy framework that operates in accordance with the bank's 'three lines of/uni00A0defence' model. This policy framework covers activities primarily focused on corporate lending and payment and investment services, but also extending to procurement, human resources and product development. We updated the framework in 2020 to reflect regulatory expectations and have now integrated sustainability risk - and climate and environmental risk, in particular - into our entire risk management  practice       .\n\nSpecific requirements apply to clients operating in sectors considered to have a particularly high sustainability risk. The/uni00A0requirements we set define how we expect clients to manage their sustainability risks: these risks are primarily inside-out risks, but increasingly also include outside-in risks. In line with our risk taxonomy, the requirements relate to ESG risks, but also link to the themes on which our\n\ncorporate strategy is focused: climate, circularity and social impact/human rights.\n\nThe requirements and other elements of the framework are/uni00A0updated regularly. The updating in 2020 included new requirements for financial institutions and for clients active in animal protein production, as well as an updating of the country sustainability risk list (containing a sustainability risk rating for each country) and the controversial weapons list (containing a list of the companies we will not finance or invest in on behalf of our clients because the companies manufacture or trade controversial weapons such as cluster/uni00A0ammunition).\n\n## Client assessment\n\nFirst-line relationship managers continue to use the Global Sustainability Risk Index (GSRI) tool, developed by the bank, to assess clients' risk level based on the country and sector sustainability risk ratings, and to assess adherence to our sustainability risk framework and the applicable sectorspecific requirements. We aim to extend the use of the GSRI from clients in medium- and high-risk sectors to all sectors. For clients in high-risk sectors, second-line advice is mandatory.\n\n## Risk measurement, monitoring and steering\n\nWe measure and steer on sustainability risk in several ways, reflecting both inside-out and outside-in risks. In/uni00A0relation to climate change, for instance, we measure:\n\n- H the carbon intensity of our lending and investment portfolios (using the PCAF methodology) and their alignment with the objectives in the Paris Climate Agreement (using the science-based target methodology);\n- H progress on key carbon-reduction targets;/uni00A0\n- H coverage of physical and transition risk analyses in/uni00A0relevant sector portfolios.\n\nWe also closely monitor our engagement activities. We/uni00A0distinguish three types of engagement as a mitigation strategy towards clients that do not fully comply with the requirements in our Sustainability Risk Policy Framework: normal-intensity engagement, high-intensity engagement and thematic engagement. Normal-intensity engagement is/uni00A0part of the regular client communication and review cycle/uni00A0and addresses minor deviations or opportunities for/uni00A0improvement. High-intensity engagement, on the other/uni00A0hand, is a formal process in which the bank reaches agreement with a client on significant improvements as a condition of credit approval. Lastly, thematic engagement entails engagement with multiple clients, and possibly other stakeholders, on wider-ranging sustainability issues.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The bank's ambition of 'Banking for better for generations to come' is best served by our inclusive approach: rather than excluding underperforming companies, we support them in improving their performance. In this way, sustainability risk management contributes to achieving our sustainability strategy. In 2020 we published an updated climate statement in which the/uni00A0intertwining of our sustainability risk management and our sustainability strategy is set out specifically in relation to climate change.\n\n## Climate risk approach\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is strongly committed to implementing the/uni00A0recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we endorsed back in 2017. In 2019, we took our first steps in using scenario analysis to measure and disclose climate risk in our mortgage and upstream oil and gas portfolios. In 2020 we extended the use of climate scenario analysis to four additional sectors: commercial real estate, agriculture, energy and shipping.\n\nThese sectors were identified as priority sectors following a/uni00A0heatmap exercise based on the methodology provided by the UN Environmental Programme for Financial Institutions. The resulting heatmap shows the material sectors in terms of sensitivity to transition and physical climate risks and lending exposure (please refer to Sustainability Risk in the/uni00A0Risk, funding & capital review section). The scenario analysis then focuses on measuring the actual climate risk of our portfolios in these sectors. These scenario analyses focus on risk materialising both in the short term and the long term (up to 30 years).\n\nProgress has also been made in implementing other recommendations in the four TCFD pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Information can be found on this throughout the report. Please also refer to the Climate disclosure index in the Non-financial review in the Strategy & performance chapter. As climate risk is defined in the ABN/uni00A0AMRO Taxonomy as/uni00A0part of sustainability risk it falls under the responsibility of the CRO. Further steps have/uni00A0been taken to integrate the/uni00A0management of climate risk within the three lines of/uni00A0defence model, impacting a broad variety of business lines and functions./uni00A0The imminent regulatory changes will/uni00A0further contribute to setting the standard for climate risk management, which will gradually be implemented in/uni00A0the coming years.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Risk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The strategic Risk Appetite Statement expresses ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategy of pursuing a moderate risk profile. The five elements of this strategic Risk Appetite Statement ensure a coherent balance between a/uni00A0sustainable return and value creation, our client centric business model, capital, and liquidity and funding, taking into account the conduct, governance and control framework. The main conclusions of this assessment are summarised below.\n\n## Client-centric business model and sustainable return and/uni00A0value creation\n\nABN AMRO focuses on growth, with a focus on clients and/uni00A0sustainability, within the boundaries/uni00A0 of our moderate risk profile in order to achieve a healthy long-term, riskadjusted return.

The current economic and/uni00A0monetary conditions, specifically developments relating to Covid-19 and sustained low and negative interest rates, are having an impact on global trade, current business and margins and revenues.\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding\n\nComfortable buffers are in place to meet capital and liquidity requirements from a regulatory and internal (i.e. economic capital) perspective. In addition, stress testing indicates that/uni00A0sufficient buffers are in place for times of stress.\n\n## Conduct, governance and control framework\n\nCapital buffers are also in place to cover non-financial risks. In managing these risks, we face challenges regarding our ability to fully comply with all regulatory requirements. Specific areas where the risk of non-compliance with regulations requires an ongoing and substantial effort/uni00A0are:\n\n- H Customer Due Diligence/Know Your Client, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF);\n- H Duty of care;\n- H Credit risk model management.\n\nOver the past few years, the number of FTEs working on DFC has increased to around 3,800. Regulatory compliance risk is mitigated by ensuring staff remain aware of regulatory programmes through ongoing training and presentations.\n\nBehavioural risk/uni00A0has also been introduced as/uni00A0a new risk type in our risk taxonomy.\n\nIn addition, the bank has to meet requirements in the field of data aggregation and risk reporting that require a substantial effort. These aspects of data management, combined with issues regarding data quality and data knowledge, may result in suboptimal decision-making and business process execution, as well as in elevated model risk and missed opportunities in the application of new technologies. A multi-year approach continues to be required in order for the bank to reach the desired level.\n\n## Balance sheet composition\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is mainly active in the Dutch market and in/uni00A0international operations where we have specific expertise/uni00A0and hold leading positions in selective activities.\n\n## Balance sheet composition at 31 December 2020 (in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe balance sheet composition reflects the bank's moderate risk profile. The characteristics that limit risk/uni00A0in the balance sheet include:\n\n- H Loan portfolio matched by deposits, long-term debt and/uni00A0equity;\n- H Strong focus on collateralised lending;\n- H Reducing concentration on single client exposure;\n- H Limited market risk and trading portfolios;\n- H Strong capital position/uni00A0reflected in a leverage ratio of/uni00A0at/uni00A0least 4%;\n- H CET1 ratio/uni00A0well above the regulatory/uni00A0requirements so as to achieve Basel IV/uni00A0compliance/uni00A0early in the phase-in period;\n- H Strategic focus on limiting LtD ratio by diversifying the funding structure and maintaining LtD at < 129%;\n- H Sufficient liquidity buffers to survive 12/uni00A0months of severe/uni00A0stress.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Impact of Covid-19 on credit risk profile\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdowns in the Netherlands and other countries in which we are active affected our processes and our clients. The Netherlands went through two periods of lockdown measures during the year, and the government engaged in large-scale support programmes aimed at reducing the impact of the/uni00A0lockdown on the economy. Together with the relief measures provided by banks, the government support had a positive effect on payment behaviour by reducing clients' payment obligations. As a result, the number of bankruptcies reported in the Netherlands was at a very low level throughout the year.\n\nMost payment holiday schemes we offered to clients ended by 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020. After these/uni00A0payment holidays ended, no/uni00A0'cliff effect' was observed and significant numbers of/uni00A0clients re-initiated repayments. The impact of Covid-19 on the credit quality of the portfolio was limited, with some increases in credit arrears and forborne exposure. Although impairments related to Covid-19 were high in the first half of the year, these were more moderate in the second half of the year. The current stage ratios reflect the/uni00A0Commercial Banking activities' exposure to downside risk as a result of Covid-19, for/uni00A0which we have made provisions. We continue to expect the impact of Covid-19 to/uni00A0persist into 2021, albeit with lower impairment levels than in 2020.\n\n## Portfolio review\n\nTotal loans and advances decreased to EUR/uni00A0254.8 billion at/uni00A031/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: 270.4 billion). All/uni00A0product groups contributed to this decrease, except for/uni00A0other loans and advances. The largest decline was in corporate loans, owing to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio of Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) in line with the CIB review announced in the second quarter of 2020. Residential mortgages decreased because redemptions in 2020 exceeded the new production of mortgage loans. Other loans and advances increased owing to higher cash collateral demands within Clearing.\n\n## Exposure at Default\n\nExposure at Default (EAD) increased to EUR/uni00A0407.4 billion (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A0393.2 billion) in relation to the ECB's targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTRO). ABN/uni00A0AMRO increased its participation in TLTRO to support clients and their potential future needs due to Covid-19. The/uni00A0EAD increase in Group Functions was offset by volume declines in all other business lines, but mainly in CIB because of the wind-down of the non-core portfolio.\n\n## Credit quality indicators\n\nThe credit quality indicators in 2020 were strongly impacted by Covid-19. The forbearance ratio almost doubled compared to last year, due to an inflow of forborne assets. These were mainly generated by European corporate loans and to a lesser extent by Dutch residential mortgages, for which loans with a payment deferral were classified as forborne in Q3.\n\nThe past due ratio improved to 1.0% compared with year-end 2019 (1.2%). Arrears decreased in all product groups, but mainly in residential mortgages and to a lesser extent in consumer and corporate loans. This decrease was driven by short-term arrears and supported by Covid-19 circumstances (lower consumer spending and/or payment holidays granted until 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020).\n\nThe stage 3 coverage ratio increased to 32.7% at year-end 2020 (2019: 29.6%). The increase was attributable to the/uni00A0first half of the year, when all stage 3 CIB clients were/uni00A0re-evaluated to assess the impact on them of the outbreak of Covid-19. Increases in allowances were recorded for existing stage 3 clients in the energy services sector in CIB and in the food and shipping sectors in CIB/uni00A0and CB. The stage 3 impaired ratio increased to 3.4%\n\nduring 2020 (2019: 2.5%), with the main contribution being attributable to the first half of the year. This was the result of inflow from stage 2 within corporate loans. In addition, decreasing total exposure as a result of the wind-down of/uni00A0the non-core CIB portfolio contributed to the increase in/uni00A0the stage 3 impaired ratio.\n\nThe impairment charges in 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A02,303/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A0657/uni00A0million), resulting in/uni00A0a/uni00A0cost of risk of 78bps. This was sharply higher than the/uni00A0through-the-cycle cost of risk (25-30bps) and the cost/uni00A0of/uni00A0risk in 2019 (24bps) and mainly attributable to three/uni00A0large exceptional client files and the economic impact/uni00A0of Covid-19 and oil price developments in 2020. In/uni00A0addition, management overlays were recorded to incorporate risks not fully captured by the outcomes of our/uni00A0ECL models. We expect Covid-19 to continue affecting impairment charges in 2021.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nTotal RWA increased to EUR/uni00A0110.5 billion (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A0109.8 billion) due to an increase in credit risk RWA offset by a decrease in operational risk RWA. Market risk RWA remained stable. The increase in credit risk was predominantly driven by regulatory add-ons/uni00A0(partly TRIM) and the introduction of the new definition of default. This movement was partly offset by business developments, largely related to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio in/uni00A0CIB. Operational risk decreased in line with the declining trend of operational losses and the removal of regulatory capital add-ons.\n\n## Definition of default b\n\nIn Q2 2020, we implemented a uniform definition of default (DoD) for all credit exposures except mortgages. The revised DoD is accounted for as a change in accounting estimates and recognised prospectively from 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02020. The implementation increased the total stage 3 exposure by approximately EUR/uni00A00.3 billion and impairment allowances by approximately EUR/uni00A028/uni00A0million. As the credit risk models have not yet been adjusted to the new default definition, an/uni00A0RWA add-on of EUR/uni00A02.1 billion was taken. For mortgages, we will apply a one-step approach, meaning that the new/uni00A0definition and updated credit risk models will be implemented simultaneously. Implementation of the updated models depends on approval by the ECB. This is expected in Q2 2021.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This movement was partly offset by business developments, including those related to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio in CIB. The increase in EC for MRBB was mainly due to the higher EC for client behaviour risk, driven by the decrease in the yield curve compared to year-end 2019. Operational risk EC decreased in line with the declining trend in operational losses and the/uni00A0removal of regulatory capital add-ons. The decrease in business risk EC was driven by the wind-down of non-core CIB activities.\n\n## Reporting scope risk\n\n|

Due to customers increased, reflecting increased client savings in response to/uni00A0the impact of Covid-19. The consolidated LCR is reported on the basis of a 12-month rolling average. The increase in LCR reflects our participation in TLTRO III, a decreasing loan book and an increasing deposit base.\n\n## Capital ratios\n\nAt 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 17.7%. The CET1 capital position decreased compared to 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019, mainly driven by a capital deduction of EUR/uni00A00.2 billion related to the regulatory guidance on non-performing exposure (NPE) and, to a lesser extent, by FX movements and the loss for 2020. The/uni00A0leverage ratio increased to 5.0% (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: 4.5%), mainly reflecting the temporary exemption of central bank reserves from the exposure measure, partly offset by/uni00A0a decline in Tier 1 capital.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

In response to these developments, we took a number of measures to ensure we could continue providing services to our clients. These measures included remote working, a sharp increase in video banking, arranging for onboarding of new employees to be done virtually, and assisting our clients to absorb the impact of the pandemic on their financial situation.\n\nThis section provides more details on the measures we offered our clients to provide them with liquidity. It also describes the way forward and the additional process changes we made during the year. The two primary relief measures we offered clients were Covid-19-related credit facilities supported by public guarantee schemes, and deferral of payments of interest and principal.\n\n## Loans and advances under public guarantee schemes b\n\ncan/uni00A0apply for government-supported loans based on the terms and conditions set by the local or central government. The final date for application varies depending on the type of government-supported loan. For most of these loans, clients could apply until 1 January 2021. For some others, this will be possible until 1 April 2021./uni00A0The guarantee covers a significant share of/uni00A0the financial asset exposure. In return for the credit guarantee, the client pays a fee to ABN/uni00A0AMRO, which subsequently transfers the fee to the government (the credit guarantor). The facilities provided in the Netherlands include the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (BMKB-C) scheme, the Corporate Finance Guarantee Scheme (GO-C) and the small credit facility (Klein Krediet Corona, or KKC) for the self-employed. Similar facilities are offered in other countries in which we operate, most notably in France. The/uni00A0demand for publicly guaranteed loans was relatively low, primarily due to the extensive range of other support measures made available by both the government and the/uni00A0bank.\n\nClients

and conditions varied by product and client/uni00A0group, the two main programmes started on 1/uni00A0April/uni00A02020 were:\n\n- H Automatic (opt-out) deferral for 6 months for corporate clients with a credit limit up to EUR/uni00A050/uni00A0million in/uni00A0Commercial Banking and Retail Banking;\n- H Deferral upon request (opt-in) for 3 months, including the/uni00A0option of extending the deferral period by an additional 3 months, for individuals - including the self-employed - with a mortgage loan/uni00A0or consumer loan.\n\nThe following table shows the number of clients and total amounts of loans and advances for which a deferral of/uni00A0payment was outstanding on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. It/uni00A0includes EBA-compliant and non-EBA-compliant moratoria/uni00A0and clients granted a/uni00A0grace period as an individual/uni00A0forbearance measure./uni00A0Active loans where the/uni00A0moratorium has ended are reported as expired.\n\nMost moratoria ended on 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020. For these loans, no 'cliff effect' was observed and a significant number of/uni00A0clients initiated repayment. The remaining payment deferrals as at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 relate primarily to grace periods provided in tailored forbearance solutions.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Commercial Banking clients whose interest deferral ended on 1/uni00A0October 2020. To make sure that ending the payment holiday would not lead to unforeseen financial difficulties, individual credit risk assessments were made in Q3 2020. All/uni00A0clients with an increased risk of non-repayment were classified as stage 2, and clients with default triggers were transferred to stage 3. Deferred interest payments for current account and overdraft facilities will be collected on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021. For loans, the deferred interest will be added to the final repayment of principal. Deferred interest payments are not interest-bearing. Deferred repayments of principal will be added to the final repayment instalment of the loan, and became interest-bearing on 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020.\n\n## Deferral upon request (opt-in)\n\nClients were able to apply for an opt-in measure until 1/uni00A0October, which means the last of these measures will/uni00A0end by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Repayments of deferred payments on our mortgage loans started in batches in/uni00A0October/uni00A02020 (with the next batches starting in/uni00A0February and April 2021) and will be spread over 5 years for 3-month deferrals, or 10 years if the period was extended to 6 months. Other business lines have implemented customised collection dates that vary depending on the product or client.\n\n## Measures to mitigate Covid-19 impact\n\nAs at 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020 we decided not to continue providing collective measures, but instead to offer tailored measures to clients affected by Covid-19. The measures we offer carefully assess the viability of the client's business and the resilience of the relevant sector to the economic challenges posed by Covid-19.\n\nIn addition to adopting a customised approach, we took measures to limit the adverse effects of Covid-19 on our clients and the bank. In the loan origination process for new clients we introduced extra checks to assess the resilience of the client's economic sector, while we are also applying stricter acceptance criteria for people on temporary contracts and the self-employed. In the case of mortgage applications,\n\nwe have added Covid-19-related questions to reflect the/uni00A0client's situation in the current circumstances. Lastly,/uni00A0all/uni00A0clients with an increased risk of non-repayment were classified as stage 2 and clients with default triggers were transferred to stage 3 during the year.\n\n## Impact of relief measures on credit risk measurement b\n\nThe objective, scope and conditions of the relief measures co-determine how the regulatory framework should be applied in this context. Where relevant, application of the appropriate risk classification (e.g. forbearance, default or stage shifts) reflects recently issued supervisory guidance. The impact of the various relief measures on these risk classifications is explained in the credit risk section.\n\n## Impact of Covid-19 on determining SICR\n\nAssets with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since/uni00A0initial recognition are classified in stage 2. Covid-19 significantly impacted some of the SICR triggers, mainly forbearance and watch. To account for the widespread impact of Covid-19 on credit risk, we temporarily added the/uni00A0industry sector of the client as an additional qualitative trigger. This section explains the relationship between Covid-19 and these three SICR triggers. The quantitative impact of Covid-19 on our risk classifications is presented in/uni00A0the credit risk section.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nForbearance applies to all individual clients with a liquidity need or who are facing financial difficulties and are offered borrower-specific arrangements to ensure they have sufficient liquidity to return to a healthy financial situation. Opt-out measures do not in themselves trigger forbearance. Instead, opt-in measures are assessed on a client level to establish whether the specific client is experiencing financial difficulties, and subsequently if the forbearance status is applicable.\n\n## Watch\n\nBesides the normal review process ABN AMRO performed additional actions to ensure correct risk classification. These/uni00A0included additional client reviews, primarily of clients granted a payment moratorium. The outcome of these\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each month, therefore, ABN AMRO identified the subsectors with an SICR. All clients in the subsectors with an elevated risk were transferred to stage 2, except for clients that had opted out of the payment holiday scheme. The increase in ECL that resulted from these stage overrides was recorded as a management overlay.\n\n## Modification in relation to relief measures\n\nRelief measures provided by ABN/uni00A0AMRO, including payment moratoria, may result in modification of a/uni00A0financial/uni00A0asset. Deferred collection of payments without compound interest being charged on the delay will have a/uni00A0negative impact on the net present value of a financial asset. If a financial asset is modified, its gross carrying amount is recalculated, based on the net present value of/uni00A0the modified or renegotiated contractual cash flows. These are then discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate and accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset's gross carrying value. The effect is recognised as a modification loss in the income statement. As relief measures relating to Covid-19 have not resulted in/uni00A0substantial modification, the financial assets have not been derecognised.\n\n## Introduction\n\nStrategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This increase was partly offset by lower exposure to corporates and institutions\n\nmainly due to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio in CIB. This also explains the decrease in the sub-investment grade portfolio. The increase in the impaired portfolio was largely attributable to inflow in the corporate portfolio in both Commercial Banking and CIB.\n\n|                                           | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions, Exposure at Default) | Investment grade                 | Sub-investment  grade            | Impaired                         | Total                            |\n| Central governments and central banks     | 98,800                           | 91                               | 9                                | 98,900                           |\n| Institutions 1                            | 10,326                           | 457                              |                                  | 10,783                           |\n| Corporates                                | 37,652                           | 51,824                           | 6,881                            | 96,357                           |\n| Retail                                    | 152,993                          | 18,322                           | 1,782                            | 173,097                          |\n| -

Stage 2 clients are primarily in the medium internal UCRs, primarily visible for mortgages loans and corporate loans. Compared to 2019, the share of the portfolio with an investment grade increased marginally, mainly due to lower total exposure attributable to the decrease in sub-investment grade clients in CIB's non-core corporate loans. In addition, payment moratoria and government support measures had a positive effect on clients' payment behaviour. UCR 6+ is also the default rating for clients that are being revised until a new rating is available. The impact of Covid-19 on the/uni00A0stage movements and the measures taken by the bank are explained in more detail in the information on coverage and stage ratios.\n\n## Credit risk concentration b Geographic concentration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe exposures in the table below have been classified on/uni00A0the basis of the geographical regions where clients are/uni00A0domiciled.

        "page_content": "The EAD concentrated in the Netherlands increased to/uni00A075.1% of the bank's portfolio in 2020 (2019: 70.9%). EAD/uni00A0in the Netherlands increased to EUR/uni00A0303.7 billion at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A0276.3 billion) as a result of the ECB's TLTRO to support clients and potential future needs arising because of Covid-19. This increase is reflected in central governments and central banks. All other regions showed declines in EAD, largely attributable to the wind-down of the non-core CIB portfolio. Businesses outside the Netherlands are primarily located in neighbouring countries in Europe. Clearing and Securities Financing are also located outside Europe. The non-core CIB/uni00A0portfolio is also partly located outside Europe.\n\n## Industry concentration\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies industry concentration limits in line with the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB)./uni00A0In the exposure table, non-material industry clusters are aggregated under Other. Industry concentration limits/uni00A0are established\n\nwithin the bank's risk appetite, with the thresholds for concentrations being based on relative risk,/uni00A0the importance of the industry to the Dutch economy and expert opinion.\n\nIndustry concentration is presented both in terms of the/uni00A0original obligor and the resultant obligor. The original obligor is the counterparty (often referred to/uni00A0as the borrower) with whom ABN/uni00A0AMRO has the original contractual relationship. The resultant obligor is the counterparty bearing the ultimate credit risk and is often referred to as/uni00A0the guarantor. The industry classification of/uni00A0the original obligor may differ from that of the resultant obligor in,/uni00A0for example, the real estate, healthcare and public administration sectors. While government-guaranteed exposures are included in the applicable industry in the original obligor view, these exposures are included/uni00A0in public administration in the resultant obligor view as they entail government-related exposures.\n\n## Industry concentration by EAD b\n\n|                                                               | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020          |

services include asset managers, credit card companies and providers of personal financial services and securities and brokers.\n- 2 Other includes travel and leisure, utilities, personal and household goods, media, technology, automobile and parts, chemicals, telecommunication and insurance, in addition to unclassified.\n- 3 Exposure at Default does not include other non-credit obligations and equities not held for trading.\n\nThe total increase in EAD is largely explained by an increase/uni00A0in public administration (non-ICB) relating to the/uni00A0ECB's TLTRO programme, which is intended to be used/uni00A0to support clients and potential future needs arising as/uni00A0a result of Covid-19. This EAD increase was partly offset/uni00A0by EAD declines in CIB-related sectors such as basic/uni00A0resources, oil and gas, and chemicals. In addition, EAD to private individuals decreased because mortgage redemptions exceeded new mortgage production.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation b\n\nCollateral reporting is based on the net collateral value (NCV).\n\nThe NCV represents the amount the bank expects to recover from the collateral pledged to the bank if the client defaults. Where necessary, certain discounts are applied. The NCV is approached by an average recovery rate observed for the specific type of collateral and, where applicable, by applying haircuts, for example in the event of/uni00A0currency mismatches. Surplus collateral is the amount of/uni00A0over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis. A/uni00A0surplus is not included for guarantees as the debtor cannot be liable for more than the maximum debt.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

P&L.\n- 2 Carrying amount includes loan impairment allowances where applicable.\n- 3 Collateral in the column Master netting agreement is mainly markets related and consists of master netting agreements which also includes cash collateral as part of these agreements. Cash/uni00A0collateral not part of master netting agreements has been reported under the column Financial instruments.\n- 4 Net exposure represents the portfolio corrected for the surplus amount and gives a view on the potential shortfall in collateral on the total portfolio.\n\nIn line with the decrease in carrying amount, total risk mitigation declined due to collateral movements in corporate loans. This was evidenced by a decline in financial instruments, mainly driven by lower clearing business, and by declines in other collateral and guarantees and property and equipment. The decline in total risk mitigation was partly offset by residential mortgages. The main reason for the increase in/uni00A0property and equipment was indexation, which resulted in an increase in surplus collateral. The impact of Covid-19 on the housing market in 2020 was limited.\n\nThe total net exposure of loans and advances customers decreased to EUR 42.0 billion in 2020 (31 December 2019:\n\nEUR 46.1 billion). This was primarily driven by lower corporate loan exposure and partly offset by other loans and/uni00A0advances. The decline in net exposure of corporate loans was related to the wind-down of non-core business in CIB that was announced in Q2 2020. Net exposure in other loans and advances increased due to clearing activities (i.e./uni00A0posting cash collateral and default fund contributions).\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding\n\n&/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

the column Master netting agreement is mainly markets related and consists of master netting agreements which also includes cash collateral as part of these agreements. Cash/uni00A0collateral not part of master netting agreements has been reported under the column Financial instruments.\n- 3 Surplus collateral is the amount of over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis.\n- 4 Net exposure represents the portfolio corrected for the surplus amount and gives a view on the potential shortfall in collateral on the total portfolio.\n\nCollateral and guarantees for credit-impaired assets (stage 3) represent credit risk mitigation based on the NCV for clients in default. The carrying amount includes expected credit loss allowances, based on the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining life/uni00A0of the financial instrument for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The Financial Restructuring & Recovery department identifies the most likely scenarios for nonprogramme lending defaulted clients (going concern or gone concern) and, using its professional judgement, the/uni00A0amounts and timing of expected future cash flows. This/uni00A0explains why a net exposure remains after collateral pledged to the bank is taken into account.\n\nIn line with the increase in the stage 3 carrying amount to/uni00A0EUR/uni00A05.7 billion (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A04.7 billion), total/uni00A0risk mitigation increased to EUR/uni00A06.1 billion in 2020 (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A05.2 billion). This increase was observed in property and equipment, other collateral and guarantees, and financial instruments. Property and equipment moved up for corporate loans and residential mortgages. The movement in property and equipment\n\nfor/uni00A0corporate loans was due to increases in corporate and commercial real estate from Commercial Banking clients, partly offset by a decrease in moveable property and equipment from CIB clients. In the case of residential mortgages, the increase was due to indexation. The main reason why other collateral and guarantees moved up was higher intangibles and other non-financial collateral from CIB clients in the United States. Financial instruments in corporate loans recorded higher collateral in the form of receivables from Asset-Based Finance clients. As the increase in total risk mitigation partly included surplus collateral, net exposure increased by EUR/uni00A0176/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0835/uni00A0million at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020.\n\nDuring 2020 ABN/uni00A0AMRO obtained property and equipment by taking possession of collateral held as security for loans/uni00A0and advances. The total amount of such assets held on/uni00A031/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 amounted to EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million). ABN/uni00A0AMRO does not intend to use these assets in its operations and will pursue timely and orderly realisation of the collateral.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding\n\n&/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding\n\n&/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

total forborne portfolio increased to EUR/uni00A012.9/uni00A0billion (2019: EUR 6.4 billion). This rise was mainly driven by growth in forborne corporate loans and, to a lesser extent, in forborne residential mortgages. The increase in forborne corporate loans was primarily due to/uni00A0new forborne clients in Commercial Banking and CIB, caused mainly by increased forborne exposures in the\n\nEuropean industrial goods and services sector, travel and leisure, and in the oil and gas sector in the United States. The inflow of corporate loans was largely a result of covenant waivers and resets. The mortgage loans for which/uni00A0a payment deferral had been granted were classified as forborne in Q3, resulting in an increase in residential mortgages classified as forborne.\n\n31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019\n\n|                                                     |                           | Performing assets           | Performing assets           |

exposure declined to EUR/uni00A02.6 billion compared with year-end 2019 (EUR/uni00A03.2 billion). Arrears decreased in all product groups, but mainly in residential mortgages and to a lesser extent in consumer loans and corporate loans. The decrease in past due exposure was driven by short-term arrears and supported by Covid-19\n\ncircumstances (including lower consumer spending and/or payment holidays granted in the period to 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020). The decrease in short-term arrears was partly offset by increases in mid- and long-term arrears (>30-90 and >90 days respectively), which were related mainly to corporate loans and more specifically to some larger Asset-Based Finance clients in Commercial Banking.\n\n31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

In response to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, all stage 3 corporate clients were re-evaluated which resulted in increases in allowances. Increases for existing stage 3 clients were mainly recorded in the energy services sector, while the stage 3 coverage ratio also rose because of increases for new inflow and existing clients in the food and shipping sectors in CIB and/uni00A0CB.\n\nAs a result of measures taken to mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19, the stage 2 ratio increased to 10.2% (2019: 6.4%). All credit portfolios were reviewed to identify any significant increase in credit risk in the context of IFRS 9. This resulted in an increase in stage 2 exposure, mainly in/uni00A0corporate loans. At the start of Covid-19, several subsectors within Commercial Banking were identified as having a significant increased credit risk and were therefore transferred to stage 2. In the subsequent months, this subsector-based assessment was replaced by individual assessments. For Retail Banking, identification of significant increased credit risk was initially carried out by profession.\n\n## Exposure flow b\n\nGross carrying amount of total loans and advances\n\nb\n\n|                                             | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                        | Stage 1     | Stage 2     | Stage 3     | Total       | Stage 1     | Stage 2     | Stage 3     | Total       |\n| Balance at 1 January                        | 246,631     | 17,066      | 6,740       | 270,437     | 256,938     | 13,137      | 5,887       | 275,962     |\n| Transfer to stage 1                         | 5,250       | -5,202      | -48         |             | 3,499       | -3,456      | -43         |             |\n| Transfer to stage 2                         | -18,455     | 19,122      | -667        |             | -12,374     | 12,758      | -384        |             |\n| Transfer to stage 3                         | -2,451      | -2,140      | 4,591       |             | -1,521      | -1,433      | 2,954       |             |\n| Additional drawdowns and partial repayments | -11,199     | 1,110       | 797         | -9,292      | -21,333     | -1,591      | -540        | -23,464     |\n| Originated or purchased                     | 35,887      |             |             | 35,887      | 43,058      |             |             | 43,058      |\n| Matured or sold                             | -32,568     | -4,035      | -1,521      | -38,123     | -22,760     | -2,284      | -597        | -25,640     |\n| Write-offs                                  |             |             | -1,194      | -1,194      |             |             | -608        | -608        |\n| Foreign exchange                            | -2,385      | -289        | -209        | -2,883      | 1,046       | 61          | 36          | 1,143       |\n| Other movements                             | -6          | -29         | -15         | -51         | 78          | -126        | 35          | -13         |\n| Balance at 31 December                      | 220,705     | 25,602      | 8,474       | 254,781     | 246,631     | 17,066      | 6,740       | 270,437     |\n\n- 1 Excluding loans at fair value through P&L.\n- 2 Gross carrying amount excludes fair value adjustments from hedge accounting.\n\nThe total on-balance sheet exposure decreased/uni00A0in 2020, in/uni00A0combination with a stage shift from stage 1 to stages 2 and 3. The decrease in exposure of EUR/uni00A015.7 billion was primarily due to CIB (EUR/uni00A010.3 billion) and to a lesser extent to residential mortgages in Retail Banking (EUR/uni00A02.7 billion) and Commercial Banking (EUR/uni00A02.2 billion). The decrease in/uni00A0CIB is primarily explained by the strategy review and to a/uni00A0lesser extent by the dollar's depreciation against the euro.\n\nThese movements are reflected in the increased matured positions and a larger reduction in FX movements. The mortgage portfolio decreased slightly because of a modest slowdown in mortgage production resulting in lower originated amounts than in 2019. The exposure flows per product class are disclosed in the Additional risk, funding & capital disclosures.\n\nDuring the second half of 2020, this assessment, too, was/uni00A0replaced by individual assessments.\n\nThe stage 2 coverage ratio increased to 1.6% in 2020 (2019:/uni00A01.5%). This was mainly the result of management overlays , which were taken in Commercial Banking for risks not fully captured by the risk parameters, and in CIB for/uni00A0risk costs related to the wind-down of the/uni00A0non-core portfolio. Without management overlays, the stage 2 coverage ratio for corporate loans would have been 1.2% at year-end 2020 (2019: 1.3%). The increase in the stage 1 coverage ratio for/uni00A0corporate loans to 0.4% (2019: 0.2%) was also entirely related to management overlays./uni00A0\n\nThe stage 2 coverage ratios for consumer loans and residential mortgages decreased at year-end 2020, both/uni00A0mainly as a result of decreased management overlays. For residential mortgages, a release was recorded for the total management overlay for interest-only mortgages. For/uni00A0consumer loans, there was a transfer of service loans to/uni00A0both stage 1 and stage 3 during the year. This resulted in/uni00A0a release of the management overlay in stage 2, and/uni00A0therefore in a decrease in the coverage ratio.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

These charges were high due to the impact that Covid-19 and oil price developments had on our client portfolio and to three exceptional client files. Individual impairments in stage 3 were/uni00A0recorded mainly for corporate loans. The impairment charges in stage 1 and stage 2 related mainly to management overlays.\n\nImpairment charges for CIB amounted to EUR 1,659 million, which was considerably higher than the EUR 376 million recorded in 2019. Since the start of Covid-19, all individual CIB exposures have been reviewed, leading to a significant increased credit risk in stage 3.Of the total impairment charges for CIB, an amount of EUR 629 million was attributable to three exceptional client files. The other impairment charges related to other individual client files and were mostly recorded in the oil and gas and energy-offshore sectors.\n\nAdditions for Commercial Banking amounted to EUR/uni00A0542/uni00A0million (2019: EUR 182 million). The main contributions related to individual client files in the food and shipping sectors, and to a lesser extent to new inflow from industrial goods and services and the travel and leisure sector. In addition, management overlays were recorded for CB to incorporate risk not adequately captured by the models. The ECL outcomes would not appear to represent deteriorations that had been expected for individual counterparties, given that payment moratoria and government support measures had a positive effect on clients' payment behaviour. An increase in impairment charges was also observed because\n\nof the transfer of clients from stage 1 to stage 2, with almost all CB clients being individually assessed during 2020 after the effects of Covid-19 became apparent. Some of these clients, mainly in the food, travel and leisure and real estate/uni00A0sectors, were transferred to stage 3 in 2020.\n\nImpairment charges for consumer loans amounted to EUR/uni00A092 million (2019: EUR 50 million). The main additions were attributable to the economic impact of Covid-19, with clients being transferred to stage 2 due to a significant increased credit risk. The main client groups impacted were dentists, physiotherapists and pilots. During 2020, the various client groups were re-evaluated, and some of them were transferred back to stage 1. The new definition of default also resulted in higher impairments in 2020 because of some Retail Banking clients being transferred to stage 3.\n\nA release of EUR 18 million was recorded for residential mortgages in 2020 (2019: EUR 31 million). This release was mainly attributable to the third quarter of the year. At that time, the 12-month PD deterioration was still being used as a proxy for lifetime PD deterioration. This proxy is more sensitive to steep economic downturns and to the subsequent recovery seen in later quarters. This resulted in a transfer from stage 2 to stage 1 in Q3. In addition, a release was recorded for interest-only mortgages. These releases were partly offset by increases resulting from transfers to stage 2 at the start of Covid-19, and from model refinements, including implementation of lifetime PD, and related mainly to stage 3.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

For most clients, ECL/uni00A0is/uni00A0calculated taking into account a probability-weighted average of three economic scenarios. For our CIB portfolio, a benchmark model based on Moody's default rates is/uni00A0used.\n\nThe ECL outcomes are continually analysed and challenged, since model outcomes do not always reflect current economic environment and circumstances. This resulted in/uni00A0additional ECL of EUR/uni00A0290/uni00A0million, which were recorded as/uni00A0management overlays.\n\nThe overlays in corporate loans amounted to EUR 242 million and were recorded for the following risks, which were not captured by the ECL models:\n\n- \u00c5 As payment moratoria and government support measures had a positive effect on clients' payment behaviour, ECL outcomes for Commercial Banking did not take into account all of the expected credit risk deterioration. A management overlay was recorded for some of our performing Commercial Banking clients, based on an expected deterioration of one class in the/uni00A0risk-grade.\n- \u00c5 An overlay was recorded for the CIB non-core portfolio, in anticipation of additional risk costs associated with the/uni00A0wind-down of this portfolio. The overlay is adjusted each quarter to reflect progress made in the wind-down, and will be released once the wind-down has been completed.\n- \u00c5 An SME portfolio with an increased risk not captured by/uni00A0models was transferred to stage 2 with a higher coverage ratio.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Identification of subsectors with increased credit risk takes place on a monthly basis.\n\nFor residential mortgages, a management overlay to cover/uni00A0the refinancing risk of interest-only mortgages was continued. The overlays in consumer loans amounted to EUR 33 million and related mostly to clients with forbearance measures. All management overlays represent best estimates of the risks involved. Underlying reasoning and calculations are documented and discussed and approved by the Impairments and Provisioning Committee (IPC).\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios and ECL sensitivity/uni00A0\n\nThe calculation of the ECL takes three economic scenarios into account, each of which contains estimates for a large number of macroeconomic variables. The relative weighting of individual variables in the calculation depends on the factor loading in the ECL models and on the projected values in the scenarios. For corporates, the most influential macroeconomic variable in terms of expected credit loss is Dutch GDP growth, while/uni00A0the risk profile of Retail Banking is most affected by changes in affordability (for example, the unemployment rate) and/uni00A0collateral values (for example, house prices).\n\nThe tables show the scenarios used for calculating the ECL./uni00A0To reflect the more negative economic outlook following the stricter Covid-19 measures imposed by the/uni00A0Dutch government in the fourth quarter of 2020, the/uni00A0weighting of/uni00A0the negative scenario was increased to\n\n40% on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020. The scenarios themselves are also strongly influenced by recent developments relating to Covid-19. The second wave of registered cases led to new nationwide lockdowns, which will have a negative impact on growth. A new 'British' strain and vaccine supply disruptions in Q1 will delay the lifting of restrictions and have lowered our growth forecast for the first half of 2021. Once half of the population over 50 years old has been vaccinated, restrictions can be wound down, and this will lead to a stronger rebound in the second half. As we expect government measures to remain dynamic and dependent on the economic situation, we have assumed the impact to/uni00A0be constant.\n\nUnemployment estimates for 2021 are significantly higher than in the 2019 scenarios, but in the final quarter of 2020 we became slightly more positive on the labour market. The/uni00A0wage cost subsidy (NOW) provided by the Dutch government has been continued in order to limit the number of lay-offs. This measure has proven to be very effective in dampening the adverse effects on the labour market and we expect the stimulus package to continue under the same conditions until at least the second quarter of Q2 2021.\n\nSo far the economic downturn has not led to lower house prices. House prices are supported by the low interest rate environment and uninterrupted credit supply. Forecasts are based on very detailed analyses of the Covid-19 situation. However, the uncertainty surrounding these projections currently remains very high.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios in 2020 b\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)   | Weight   | Macroeconomic variable   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | Unweighted  ECL 4   | Weighted  ECL 4   |\n|------------------------|----------|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|                        |          | Real GDP Netherlands 1   | 4.4%   | 4.3%   | 2.0%   | 1.7%   |                     |                   |\n| Positive               | 10%      | Unemployment 2           | 6.2%   | 6.2%   | 5.6%   | 4.8%   | 653                 |                   |\n|                        |          | House price index 3      | 5.0%   | 3.0%   | 2.0%   | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n|                        |          | Real GDP Netherlands     | 3.0%   | 3.6%   | 2.3%   | 1.8%   |                     |                   |\n| Baseline               | 50%      | Unemployment             | 6.4%   | 7.9%   | 6.9%   | 6.1%   | 688                 | 703               |\n|                        |          | House price index        | 0.0%   | 0.0%   | 2.0%   | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n|                        |          | Real GDP Netherlands     | 0.7%   | 3.0%   | 1.0%   | 1.4%   |                     |                   |\n| Negative               | 40%      | Unemployment             | 6.8%   | 8.4%   | 7.8%   | 6.8%   | 734                 |                   |\n|                        |          | House price index        | -3.0%  | -5.0%  | 0.0%   | 3.0%   |                     |                   |\n\n- 1 Real GDP Netherlands, % change year-on-year.\n- 2 Unemployment Netherlands, % of labour force.\n- 3 House price index Netherlands - average % change year-on-year.\n- 4 Excluding ECL for stage 3.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase in the rest of Europe and in the United States was related mainly to/uni00A0new/uni00A0performing forborne corporate loans in/uni00A0CIB and/uni00A0to/uni00A0a/uni00A0lesser extent in Commercial Banking./uni00A0\n\nThe Netherlands contributed the most to the decline in past due but not stage 3 exposures, mainly due to a decrease in domestic residential mortgages. This movement was partly offset by the movement in the rest of Europe, which related mainly to the inflow of Asset-Based Finance clients from\n\nthe UK. In addition, Asia past due exposure decreased as/uni00A0result of the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\nIn 2020, impaired exposures and allowances increased in all/uni00A0geographies except Rest of the world. A relatively large increase in exposure and impairment charges was observed in the United States as a result of inflow from stage 2 in/uni00A0the/uni00A0energy sectors. Increases in impaired exposures and/uni00A0allowances in the Netherlands were attributed to new inflow from stages 1 and 2, mainly in the food and shipping sectors in commercial banking and CIB, partly offset by write-offs. The increase in Asia was attributable to an exceptional client file in Singapore in Q1 2020.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Broken down by industry, the increase in forborne assets in/uni00A0the industrial goods and services sector was primarily generated by the inflow of performing forborne corporate loans in CIB. The increase in the other sector was mainly caused by the inflow of performing forborne corporate loans in the travel and leisure sector in CIB and Commercial Banking. The addition of forborne loans in the private individuals sector was attributable to the mortgage loans for/uni00A0which a payment deferral had been granted and which were therefore classified as forborne in Q3.\n\nPrivate individuals, supported by Covid-19 circumstances (lower consumer spending and/or payment holidays granted till 1/uni00A0October/uni00A02020), were the main drivers of the decline in/uni00A0past due but not stage 3/uni00A0exposures. This decline was partly offset by increases in industrial goods and services and retail.\n\nImpaired exposures increased strongly during 2020. The main contributions were attributable to the oil and gas and food and beverage sectors, where increases were observed mainly for existing stage 3 clients. Smaller contributions came from the travel and leisure (included in other) and real estate sectors, where new inflow in stage 3 exposure was\n\nobserved in 2020. The healthcare sector benefited from releases in both credit-impaired exposures for credit losses and allowances. These were attributable to a few larger files in Commercial Banking.\n\n## Developments in specific portfolios\n\nThe following section provides a more detailed overview of/uni00A0developments in specific portfolios and/uni00A0products.\n\n## Residential mortgages\n\nThe Dutch housing market is being impacted by a shortage of homes available for sale. Despite Covid-19, residential property prices continued to rise as a result of consumer confidence, the housing shortage and low interest rates. The housing price index published by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) at the end of 2020 was 8.4% higher than at the end of/uni00A02019.

The decrease in/uni00A0the RWA was mainly due to a decrease in exposure. Exposure at default (EAD) decreased to EUR/uni00A0163.8 billion (2019: EUR/uni00A0164.6 billion).\n\n## Credit quality indicators\n\nIn general, the credit quality indicators for residential mortgages improved in line with the performance of the/uni00A0Dutch housing market. The past due ratio decreased, mainly due to the limited inflow into past due exposures in/uni00A0short-term arrears. Affordability of mortgages remained good this year due to the government's Covid-19 support measures in combination with lower consumer spending. The coverage ratio decreased as a result of improved credit quality and higher collateral values. The stage 3 exposure increased as a result of the UTP trigger regarding clients with interest-only mortgages and the high refinancing risk at maturity. The forborne ratio increased owing to Covid-19 payment holidays.\n\n## Residential mortgages to indexed market value\n\n|                      | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | Gross carrying  amount                                          |                                                                 | Percentage  of total                                            | Percentage  of total                                            | Gross carrying  amount                                          | of total                                                        | Percentage                                                      | Percentage                                                      |\n| (in/uni00A0millions) |                                                                 |                                                                 | -

Note that LtMVs in/uni00A0excess of 100% do not necessarily indicate that these clients are in financial difficulties. ABN/uni00A0AMRO actively approaches clients with an interest-only mortgage in combination with a high LtMV level to discuss changing their mortgage product.

The hybrid portfolio consists of a combination of savings and investment mortgages.\n\nThe effects of the changes in the Dutch tax regulations are clearly reflected in the loan modification breakdown by year. Mortgage loan type originations in 2020 (defined as new production and mortgages with a loan type modification) comprised 26.1% interest-only, 67.8% redeeming mortgages and 0.8% savings mortgages.

The majority of/uni00A0the interest-only inflow is part of a mixed mortgage.\n\n## Commercial real estate (CRE)\n\nThe Dutch commercial real estate (investment) market shrank in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty caused by/uni00A0Covid-19 and the negative implications for various asset types. A total of EUR 17.9 billion was invested in 2020. This/uni00A0was a decrease of 17.2% compared with 2019 and the/uni00A0first decline in 10 years. The number of transactions (rental and buying) also decreased in 2020, by 20.9%.\n\nDemand for office space is declining due to the economic contraction, rising unemployment and the work-from-home trend triggered by Covid-19. Although the number of transactions declined rapidly in 2020, most of the negative effects will be visible in 2021. Lower demand for office space will in future create scope for transforming offices into residential space.\n\nThe residential market is a late-cyclical market. Private rental prices consequently continued rising by 0.2% in 2020, but the growth rate is declining. The residential market will be affected by consumers'/uni00A0lower disposable income and by rising unemployment. This will put pressure on rents and on the value of residential buildings, although demand for private rental properties remains high due to/uni00A0rising house prices, stricter rules on mortgage lending, a/uni00A0lack of new-builds, and more limited access to rental properties in the social housing sector.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The industrial market benefited in 2020 from the strong rise in e-commerce. Although this trend had already been visible in the past few years, it gained momentum due to retail premises being closed in order to get Covid-19 under control. At the same time, the continuing rise of e-commerce is putting pressure on the retail market, which is struggling. As a result, vacancy rates for retail properties are increasing.\n\n## Commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio\n\nIn Q2 2020, we redefined the scope of our CRE portfolio in line with EBA guidelines on loan origination and monitoring. The CRE portfolio includes all loans aimed at acquiring CRE property or secured by CRE property, whereby CRE means any income-producing real estate, either existing or under development or renovation. It excludes social housing,\n\nproperty owned by end-users, buy-to-let housing below a/uni00A0market value of EUR 2 million and unsecured general purpose lending. The credit exposure relating to the above definition is monitored on a quarterly basis and subject to/uni00A0an EAD limit.\n\nAdjusted for the new definition, the EAD increased to/uni00A0EUR/uni00A012.9 billion in 2020 (2019: EAD 12.2 billion). The/uni00A0stage/uni00A03/uni00A0impaired ratio increased moderately to 3.5% (31/uni00A0December 2019: 1.5%) as a result of Covid-19. The increase in the impairment rate was mainly visible for retail/uni00A0properties. The CRE loan portfolio is largely based on Dutch properties and consists primarily of investment loans that are well diversified across different asset types.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3 Excluding collateral not defined as commercial real estate collateral, such as currency and deposits, financial guarantees and life insurance policies pledged.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

declines because of unfavourable market movements. The market risk in the banking book consists predominantly of interest rate risk and credit spread risk in the liquidity portfolio.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises from holding assets such as loans with interest rate maturities that are different from the interest rate maturities of liabilities, such as deposits. The assets have a longer average maturity than the liabilities. This applies to contractual as well as behavioural maturities.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro) hedges/uni00A0and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges to swap fixed interest rates for floating interest rate positions.\n\nThe resulting interest rate position, after application of interest rate hedges, is in line with the bank's strategy and/uni00A0risk appetite.\n\n|                              |   31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 |   31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019 |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| NII-at-risk (in %)           |                             -1.6 |                               -1 |\n| PV01 (in EUR/uni00A0million) |                             -3.9 |                               -7 |\n\n## NII-at-Risk\n\nNII-at-Risk is the difference in net interest income (NII) between a base scenario and four alternative scenarios. It/uni00A0is/uni00A0defined as the worst outcome of the following scenarios: gradual increase or decrease in interest rates by 200bps and instantaneous increase or decrease of 100bps.

NII-at-Risk figures of/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 are calculated assuming balance sheet developments in line with corporate planning. For the NII-at-Risk calculated in/uni00A0December/uni00A02019, portfolio volumes were assumed to be static. Floors on the markets rates and/uni00A0specific products are applied. The interest rate floors define how low ABN/uni00A0AMRO assumes interest rates to go/uni00A0and consequently impact the downward scenarios used/uni00A0in NII-at-Risk. ABN/uni00A0AMRO periodically reviews the/uni00A0level of these interest rate floors.\n\nThe NII-at-Risk in/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 increased to -1.6% and/uni00A0reflects a reduction of NII in the scenario of a gradual decrease in interest rates by 200bps. The scenario with the/uni00A0worst outcome for NII differs from/uni00A0December/uni00A02019, which was an instantaneous decrease of interest rates by 100bps. The most positive NII occurs for the scenario where interest rates rise gradually by 200bps, in which NII/uni00A0would decrease from 5.6% to 4.6%, or an NII-at-Risk of/uni00A0-1.0%.\n\n## PV01\n\nPV01 measures value changes resulting from a 1bp parallel shift of the yield curve. For internal risk management, shocks on individual maturities and larger shocks are also applied. PV01 exposure decreased by EUR/uni00A03.1/uni00A0million in 2020. This decrease was due to various developments in markets and the balance sheet (such as the increase in saving deposits), which partially resulted from Covid-19 developments. ABN/uni00A0AMRO actively manages interest rate risk to keep it within the risk appetite.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk b\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO monitors its foreign exchange risk through the/uni00A0bank's aggregated open currency position (OCP). The/uni00A0most material single open foreign exchange exposures are GBP and USD.

This takes into account the fact that returns across risk factors may offset one another to a certain extent and consequently reduce risk. As long as these returns are not/uni00A0perfectly correlated to one another, VaR figures based on a diversified portfolio approach will be lower than if/uni00A0the/uni00A0figures are calculated using undiversified VaR.\n\nUndiversified VaR means that the VaR figures computed for/uni00A0the different risk factors are summed up without taking into account any offset across risk factors, and therefore negates the potential for risk reduction.\n\nThe following graph shows the total 1-day VaR at a 99% confidence level ('VaR diversified') and aggregation of the stand-alone risk factors ('VaR undiversified').\n\n## VaR diversified and undiversified (in millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal aggregated diversified and undiversified VaR for all trading positions b\n\n|                                   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)              | Diversified                      | Undiversified                    | Diversified                      | Undiversified                    |\n| VaR at last trading day of period | 1.2                              | 1.8                              | 0.9                              | 1.4                              |\n| Highest VaR                       | 3.9                              | 6.1                              | 2.4                              | 4.9                              |\n| Lowest VaR                        | 0.7                              | 0.9                              | 0.6                              | 0.9                              |\n| Average VaR                       | 2.2                              | 2.8                              | 1.1                              | 1.9                              |\n\nComparing 2019 to 2020, the average diversified 1-day VaR at a 99% confidence level moved from EUR/uni00A01.1/uni00A0million to/uni00A0EUR/uni00A02.2/uni00A0million.

        "page_content": "## Regulatory capital\n\nRWA for market risk was EUR 1.3 billion (2019: EUR 1.4 billion). The RWA decrease was due to a decline in the stressed VaR, which was mainly driven by position changes. The effect of the Stressed VaR on market risk RWA was partially offset by an increase in the VaR, which was mainly driven by model changes, i.e. the increased market volatility in the/uni00A0300-day VaR window.\n\n## IBOR Reform\n\nIn 2014, at the request of the G20, the Financial Stability Board issued a report on 'Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks'. This report set out several recommendations for strengthening existing benchmarks for key interbank offered rates (IBORs) in unsecured lending markets, and for/uni00A0promoting the development and adoption of alternative nearly risk-free reference rates, where appropriate. These recommendations led to a fundamental review of the key interest rate benchmarks used in global financial markets.\n\nIn/uni00A02020, public authorities in various jurisdictions continued to make progress on reforming or replacing the existing benchmarks. In order to ensure a smooth transition, ABN/uni00A0AMRO introduced a bank-wide project, under the responsibility of the CFO and led by ALM and Treasury, to/uni00A0prepare the bank for the forthcoming changes in IBORs. This project includes senior representatives from all relevant functions across the bank. During 2020, the bank successfully completed the switch in the discounting regime for centrally cleared swaps. The change in the discounting regime for bilateral counterparties was also started during the year and will continue in 2021. The preparations made as part of the project and the changes already executed give confidence that the changes required in 2021, such as moving away from LIBOR, will be able to/uni00A0be executed successfully. For other benchmark interest rates, such as EURIBOR, that have been reformed and can/uni00A0therefore continue, financial instruments referencing those rates will not need to transition.\n\n## Introduction\n\nStrategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Operational (non-financial) risk\n\n## Operational risk by risk type\n\nOperational losses include direct losses as well as provisions for legal claims. Net operational loss may be negative, meaning provisions formed in the past are released when no payments are ultimately made to claimants. Losses are reported according to event categories such as External Fraud; Internal Fraud; Clients, Products & Business Practices; Execution, Delivery & Process Management; Employee Practices & Workplace Safety; Disaster & Public Safety, and Technology & Infrastructure Failures.\n\nAn overall negative net operational loss was recorded in 2020 due to a combination of released provisions and lower losses in some event categories. There were significant releases of provisioned legal claims in the event categories of External Fraud (including forgery, skimming and phishing) and Clients, Products & Business Practices (including disputes with clients). Secondly, losses due to External Fraud and Clients, Products & Business Practices were significantly lower than in 2019. In addition, the number of/uni00A0attacks on ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0ATMs in 2020 was 3, compared to 52 in 2019.\n\nThe highest total net loss in 2020 was recorded in the event\n\ncategory of Execution, Delivery & Process Management. This primarily consisted of one large loss incurred as a result of a flaw in execution. This loss also caused total loss in this event category to be slightly higher than in 2019. Risk awareness and continued strengthening of controls are helping to limit these losses.\n\nSimilarly, the net loss for Employee Practices & Workplace Safety increased compared to 2019. This category includes a provision formed for arbitration proceedings initiated by the pension fund in relation to the renewed collective labour agreement.\n\n## IT & Cyber risk\n\nRemote capabilities for clients, vendors and employees were implemented on a large scale in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Digital signing and video conferencing, for example, enabled ABN/uni00A0AMRO to continue offering a seamless service to clients. Similarly, our staff were able to work remotely as a result of our enhanced network capacity.\n\nIT transformation continued through the adoption of Cloud/uni00A0services and DevOps ways of working. These were accompanied by improvements to safeguard ABN/uni00A0AMRO's overall security position against evolving threats (such as phishing and ransomware) and ensure regulatory compliance. We also devoted great efforts to ensuring the overall stability of our digital payment services and maintaining\n\nthe/uni00A0operating effectiveness of our risk and control framework. Enhanced Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) capabilities helped to mitigate incidents and limit disruption.\n\nWith our transition to open banking (PSD2), customer data (such as transactions and balances) can be aggregated, transferred, stored and used in a third party's infrastructure. This is associated with an increased risk profile for ABN/uni00A0AMRO's cyber security as it increases the attack surface for potential threats. We are continuously updating our risk management architecture to repel these threats.\n\nOverall, information risk management remains a prominent\n\narea of attention for senior management and our supervisor. The robustness of the control environment, stability and availability of systems, and the underlying infrastructure and/uni00A0architecture are focus points both for strengthening our/uni00A0cyber posture and future-proofing our organisation.\n\n## Stability of digital services\n\nThe availability of the bank's internet banking services during prime time was an average of 99.82% in 2020, compared to 99.90% in 2019. Availability was impacted by/uni00A0a/uni00A0few operational incidents in 2020 that caused the bank/uni00A0to underperform the WfT norm on some occasions. However, these incidents were fully resolved and used as/uni00A0input for further improvements to processes and underlying systems.\n\n## ATM attacks\n\nAlthough the number of attacks on ABN/uni00A0AMRO ATMs and/uni00A0seal bag machines decreased in 2020, these acts of/uni00A0criminality continue to pose risks to society as a whole as the use of heavy-duty explosives impact on the safety of/uni00A0people living near an ATM. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is continuing to/uni00A0work with the Dutch Banking Association and other relevant authorities to implement countermeasures.\n\n## Business continuity\n\nBusiness continuity management (BCM) is a core part of/uni00A0our risk management framework. BCM respects the bank's three lines of defence model and is embedded in business and support functions, subsidiaries and countries. Mitigations such as business continuity plans, crisis management, business relocation plans and IT disaster recovery plans are in place to prepare for and deal with incidents and crises threatening the continuity of critical business processes. Evaluations and root cause analyses are also performed to analyse incidents and implement lessons learned.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "During 2020 ABN/uni00A0AMRO's crisis management organisation proved able to respond adequately to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Our measures, including large-scale working from home, reflected our twofold priority to protect employee safety and ensure business continuity. Nevertheless, these measures concurrently resulted in a higher reliance on remote access and therefore in elevated risks regarding network stability and cyber security. We are continuing to/uni00A0proactively manage these risks to business continuity in/uni00A0line with developments in the Netherlands and other geographies relevant to our businesses and operations.\n\n## Change risk\n\nAn increasingly high pace of change is necessary to achieve our strategic ambitions and deliver on stakeholders' expectations. To this end, the 2020 strategy review focused on rigorously simplifying the product landscape and centralising the operating model. This will further support the bank's efforts to better serve its clients and work more efficiently. Against this backdrop, change management has become an even more important pillar of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's risk management framework. In 2020, we therefore matured our change management framework by implementing a new change management policy, together with enhanced key risk indicators (KRIs), standards and agile practice guides, and strengthened governance.\n\n## Data management\n\nData management remained within the purview of both senior management and local stakeholders during 2020. ABN/uni00A0AMRO made further steps to strengthen its data management capabilities by introducing a data governance policy, a Joint Master Plan on data and more granular data quality reporting. These were important milestones in our multi-year approach to improve the data management framework. ABN/uni00A0AMRO fully recognises that inadequate data management poses significant risks to innovation, risk/uni00A0management and decision-making, as well as to regulatory compliance.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nAs reconfirmed in the update of the bank's strategy, our licence to operate and our culture remain clear priorities, also for the Compliance function. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has been making progress in enhancing its Compliance function and/uni00A0'trust by design'. Management of compliance risk across the organisation is one of Risk Management's priorities that translates into further enhancement of the Compliance function on the basis of continuing structural improvements and a focus on the stature, permanence and/uni00A0maturity of the function.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nOperational risk RWA calculated using the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) decreased in 2020 to EUR/uni00A016.7 billion (2019: EUR/uni00A019.4 billion). This outcome was/uni00A0partly explained by a continued trend of declining operational risk losses. The decrease was also attributable to the removal of regulatory capital add-ons. In 2020, the vast majority of the ECB's findings on the capital calculation process were resolved by ABN/uni00A0AMRO, and this meant the associated capital add-ons could be removed.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's current operational risk capital level (15% of/uni00A0gross income) is still relatively conservative compared with peer banks with a moderate risk profile (14% of gross income, based on ORX benchmark data).\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This included EUR/uni00A02.0 billion of covered bonds, EUR/uni00A00.6 billion of senior preferred funding and EUR/uni00A02.5 billion of senior non-preferred funding. The senior non-preferred funding replaced the redemption of EUR/uni00A02.5 billion subordinated liabilities. In addition, ABN/uni00A0AMRO repaid EUR/uni00A08.0 billion TLTRO II borrowings and participated for EUR/uni00A032.0 billion in TLTRO III. Capital instruments are excluded in the long-term funding overview and included in the Capital review section, which provides a complete overview of all outstanding capital instruments.\n\n## Long-term funding raised in 2019 and 2020 1\n\n(notional amounts at issuance, in billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nThe issuance of the EUR 1 billion of Additional Tier 1 capital instrument is excluded from\n\nthe graph above. An overview of the capital instruments is provided in the Capital section. 2 Other long-term funding consists of the TLTRO III participation and funding with the Dutch State as counterparty. Long-term wholesale funding in non-euro currencies declined to 19.7% of total outstanding long-term wholesale funding, compared with 25.4% at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019. In/uni00A02020, the bank raised its long-term funding and capital instruments mainly in euros. The diversification of the outstanding long-term funding in non-euro currencies is/uni00A0shown in the following graph.\n\nAudited\n\n## Non-euro currency diversification of total outstanding long-term funding Audited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Maturity calendar\n\nWe target a maturity profile where redemptions of funding/uni00A0instruments are well spread over time. The average remaining maturity of newly issued wholesale funding increased to 8.6 years at year-end 2020 (8.4 years at year-end 2019), not taking into account other long-term funding. The average remaining maturity of outstanding long-term funding decreased to 4.6 years at year-end 2020 (down from 4.8 years at year-end 2019). The maturity calendar assumes redemption on the earliest possible call/uni00A0date or the legal maturity date, which does not mean that the instruments will be called at the earliest possible call date. Early redemption of subordinated instruments is/uni00A0subject to approval by the regulator.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This updated framework/uni00A0reflects regulatory developments as well as the current environment and our/uni00A0strategy. We/uni00A0continue to report on and comply with Basel III as current solvency requirements are based on Basel III. However, according to the Basel Committee, Basel IV is/uni00A0to/uni00A0be implemented by January 2023. Since Basel IV requirements are more onerous and imminent, we have adopted Basel IV as our primary capital metric, with a Basel/uni00A0IV CET1 target ratio of 13%./uni00A0\n\nAt 31 December/uni00A02020, the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 17.7%, 19.5%,\n\n## Developments impacting capital ratios in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe targeted review of internal models (TRIM) has become much clearer, given that we have received the final TRIM letter for advanced IRB models applied to corporate exposures. The final two draft TRIM letters for commodities, as well as for banks and financial institutions, have also been received. Since Q4 2018, we have recorded approximately EUR/uni00A021 billion of RWA add-ons in respect of/uni00A0TRIM, model reviews and the new definition of default.\n\nThe TRIM process is finalising. In the upcoming quarters, further increases in/uni00A0RWA may be required as the final outcomes of two draft TRIM letters are expected and models (including mortgage models) are reviewed. The/uni00A0risk/uni00A0weight floor for/uni00A0mortgages announced by DNB, which could further increase Basel III RWA for mortgages, has been postponed until further notice.\n\nand 23.7% respectively (December 2019: 18.1%, 19.9% and 25.9% respectively). The CET1 capital position decreased compared to 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019, mainly driven by a capital deduction of EUR/uni00A00.2 billion related to the regulatory guidance on non-performing exposure (NPE) and,/uni00A0to a lesser extent, by FX movements and the year-todate loss over 2020. The final dividend for 2019 remains reserved as dividend and has not been included in the CET1/uni00A0capital (inclusion in/uni00A0CET1 capital would result in a pro forma CET1 ratio of/uni00A018.3%). All capital ratios were in line with the bank's risk/uni00A0appetite and were comfortably above regulatory requirements.\n\nThe following chart shows the primary drivers of the Basel III capital ratios in 2020.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We have updated our CET1 target ratio to 13% under Basel/uni00A0IV. This consists of a management buffer on top of/uni00A0our SREP capital requirement and Pillar 2 guidance. Based on our interpretation of the Basel IV framework and/uni00A0on our expectation of how Basel IV standards will be implemented in EU legislation, the fully-loaded Basel IV CET1 ratio was estimated to be above 15% on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, comfortably above target. The assumptions applied in our calculations will be updated once we have more information on EU implementation. Basel IV calculations are also subject to/uni00A0uncertainties stemming from/uni00A0data limitations, management actions and other portfolio developments (including the wind-down of the CIB/uni00A0non-core portfolio). The/uni00A0first effects of measures implemented to mitigate Basel IV inflation are visible in the RWA and/uni00A0we are continuing to work on further mitigations to/uni00A0reduce/uni00A0the Basel IV RWA inflation.\n\nThe wind-down of the non-core portfolio in CIB is progressing steadily, contributing to our current strong capital ratios under Basel III and Basel IV and strengthening our future outlook. The finalisation of TRIM for corporates and the draft TRIM letter for commodities and for banks and financial institutions provided us with more clarity on the TRIM/uni00A0impact. However, we/uni00A0are currently also encountering a number of/uni00A0capital/uni00A0headwinds and uncertainties, including elevated/uni00A0impairments due to Covid-19, the low interest rate/uni00A0environment, the final TRIM outcome and model reviews, EU implementation of Basel IV, the AML investigation and/uni00A0the/uni00A0NPE calendar provisioning.\n\nWe continue to expect regulatory capital headwinds from/uni00A0the industry-wide non-performing exposure (NPE) guidance and minimum coverage levels for the existing stock of NPEs expected by the supervisory authorities. In/uni00A0Q2 2019, we/uni00A0recorded a supervisory capital deduction of/uni00A0around EUR/uni00A00.2 billion. An additional capital deduction of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.2 billion was recorded in Q4 2020 to meet supervisory expectations on NPE. During the phase-in from/uni00A02021 to 2024, we estimate that the combined annual impact of NPE regulations will be of a similar order/uni00A0of magnitude. The wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio may result in a lower impact, while the effect of recalibrations based on Covid-19 and recent impairments is still uncertain. We are working on mitigating actions aimed at increasing NPE velocity by intensifying management attention for clients in FR&R and/uni00A0realising potential NPE divestments, subject to market/uni00A0conditions.\n\n## Developments impacting capital ratios in 2020 Common Equity Tier 1 capital\n\nCET1 capital decreased in 2020, mainly reflecting a capital deduction of EUR/uni00A00.2 billion related to the regulatory guidance on non-performing exposure (NPE) and, to a lesser extent, FX movements and/uni00A0the year-to-date loss over/uni00A02020. The final dividend for 2019 remains reserved as/uni00A0dividend and has not been included in the CET1 capital.\n\nThe maximum distributable amount (MDA) trigger level has been temporarily reduced to 9.6% (excluding AT1 shortfall) owing to several capital relief measures announced by the/uni00A0European Central Bank (ECB) and the/uni00A0Dutch Central Bank (DNB) in/uni00A0March/uni00A02020 to support banks in serving the economy and addressing operational challenges. The ECB brought forward changes in CRDV, allowing banks to use Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 to satisfy parts of the Pillar 2 requirements. DNB abolished the systemic risk buffer and lowered the/uni00A0other systemically important institutions (OSII) buffer from 2% to 1.5%. In the future, DNB is expected to/uni00A0gradually increase the counter-cyclical capital buffer from/uni00A00% to 2%/uni00A0of Dutch risk-weighted exposures as the/uni00A0economy improves. The reported CET1 ratio of 17.7% under Basel III is/uni00A0considerably above the MDA trigger level/uni00A0of 9.6%. The/uni00A0bank remains committed to maintaining a/uni00A0significant buffer in excess of/uni00A0its regulatory requirements at all times.\n\n## Capital requirements before and after relief measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Excluding AT1 shortfall of 0.1%.\n- 2 CCyB decreased due to reduction of local CCyBs in countries where ABN AMRO is present.\n\n## Additional Tier 1\n\nIn/uni00A0May/uni00A02020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO issued an AT1 instrument to replace an outstanding AT instrument that was redeemed in/uni00A0September/uni00A02020. A total of EUR/uni00A02.0/uni00A0billion of AT1 instruments is currently outstanding. The AT1 instruments have triggers at the bank consolidated level (7.0% CET1) and solo level (5.125% CET1). If the CET1 ratio breaks through the trigger level, the AT1 is temporarily written down. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is comfortably above the trigger levels, with the bank consolidated CET1 ratio at 17.7% and the bank solo CET1 ratio at 17.3%. Available distributable items at 31 December/uni00A02020 amounted to EUR/uni00A017.9 billion (December 2019: EUR/uni00A018.5/uni00A0billion).\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\nThe/uni00A0fully-loaded total capital ratio (23.7%) decreased by 2.2/uni00A0percentage points compared to 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019 (25.9%). This was mainly due to the redemption of a EUR/uni00A01.5 billion Tier 2 instrument at 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02020 and,\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The bank issued its first tranche of EUR/uni00A01.25 billion in senior non-preferred notes in January 2020 and its second tranche of EUR/uni00A01.25 billion in/uni00A0May/uni00A02020.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nTotal RWA increased to EUR/uni00A0110.5 billion (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A0109.8 billion) due to an increase in credit risk RWA, offset by a decrease in operational risk RWA. Market risk RWA remained stable. The increase in credit risk was predominantly driven by regulatory add-ons (including TRIM) and the introduction of the new definition of default. This movement was partly offset by business developments, largely related to the wind-down of the non-core portfolio of/uni00A0CIB. Operational risk decreased in line with the declining trend of operational losses and the removal of regulatory capital add-ons.\n\n## Further information on share capital, dividend and/uni00A0capital instruments Share capital\n\nThe share capital remained unchanged in/uni00A02020. At 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, the authorised share capital amounted to EUR/uni00A02,400/uni00A0million, distributed as 2,200/uni00A0million class A ordinary shares and 200/uni00A0million class B ordinary shares. Class A and B ordinary shares have a nominal value of EUR/uni00A01.00 each.\n\nAt 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, issued and paid-up capital amounted to EUR/uni00A0940/uni00A0million and consisted of 940/uni00A0million class A ordinary shares. Further information is provided in Note 32 Equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Dividend\n\nOn 15/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, the ECB revised its recommendation on dividend payments and reiterated that/uni00A0banks should exercise extreme prudence with regard to capital distributions. To this end, the ECB recommends that banks/uni00A0refrain from distributing any cash dividends or conducting share buy-backs, or to limit such distributions, until 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02021. Given the persisting uncertainty over the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the/uni00A0ECB expects dividends and share buy-backs to remain below the lower of 15% of the cumulated profit for 20192020 and 20 basis points of the CET1 ratio. Moreover, for banks that have already distributed dividends or conducted share buy-backs to remunerate shareholders with regard to/uni00A0the 2019 financial year, the/uni00A0profit definition includes only the 2020 profit. Banks that/uni00A0intend to pay dividends or buy back shares need to/uni00A0be/uni00A0profitable and have robust capital trajectories. After/uni00A030/uni00A0September/uni00A02021, and subject to/uni00A0the/uni00A0absence of/uni00A0materially adverse developments, the/uni00A0ECB intends to/uni00A0repeal the recommendation and return to assessing banks' capital and distribution plans based on/uni00A0the outcome of the normal supervisory cycle.\n\nBased/uni00A0on this revised ECB recommendation and the year-to-date loss, no dividend will be proposed over 2020. Furthermore, the profit for 2019 (including the full-year 2019 dividend reserve) is out of scope for payment at/uni00A0Q4/uni00A02020 due to the interim dividend paid in 2019. The/uni00A0payment of AT1 coupons is not affected by the ECB's/uni00A0recommendation as the CET1 ratio is well above the MDA trigger level and there are no constraints in/uni00A0availability of distributable items (EUR/uni00A017.9 billion).\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is committed to resuming payment of dividends sustainably, conditions permitting. For the time being, we will follow the ECB recommendation and refrain from distributing capital. The payout (or/uni00A0release) of accrued full-year 2019 dividend will be/uni00A0prudently/uni00A0considered after 30/uni00A0September/uni00A02021, taking account of the status of the/uni00A0ECB dividend recommendation, as/uni00A0well as conditions and/uni00A0prospects at/uni00A0that time. Until/uni00A0a/uni00A0decision has been made,/uni00A0the final dividend for/uni00A02019/uni00A0will not be included in/uni00A0the/uni00A0CET1 capital.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

An EU proposal for Basel IV is/uni00A0expected in Q2 2021. Given recent TRIM and model review developments, constrained IRB RWA and output floored RWA are no longer expected to be materially different in a/uni00A0Basel IV fully-loaded situation at bank level. As/uni00A0a result, the benefit of the phase-in period will effectively be eliminated. The gap between Basel III and Basel IV is expected to converge further in 2021 to below 10% by year-end 2021. This is largely due to add-ons from a possible DNB mortgage floor and the move of specific portfolios to the Basel III foundation or standardised approach. We have updated our CET1 target ratio to 13%/uni00A0under Basel/uni00A0IV.\n\nBased/uni00A0on our interpretation of the Basel IV framework and/uni00A0on our expectations of how Basel/uni00A0IV standards will/uni00A0be/uni00A0implemented in EU legislation, the fully-loaded Basel/uni00A0IV CET1 ratio was estimated to be above 15% on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, comfortably above target.\n\nThe CRR fully-loaded CET1 ratio at 31 December/uni00A02020 was/uni00A017.7%, which was equal to the CRR phase-in CET1 ratio. Under the CRD IV/CRR fully-loaded rules, the amount of CET1 capital and RWA are equivalent to those under the phase-in rules. The CRR fully-loaded total capital ratio at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 was 23.7%, which was slightly lower than the CRR phase-in total capital ratio of 23.9%. In/uni00A02020, the fully-loaded ratio was lower than the phase-in ratio due to the grandfathering of some T2 capital instruments.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding\n\n&/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding\n\n&/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on the current requirement (i.e. CEM methodology for derivative exposures), the leverage ratio increased to 5.0% (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: 4.5%), mainly reflecting the temporary exemption of central bank reserves from the exposure measure, partly offset by/uni00A0a decline in Tier 1 capital. This temporary exemption had/uni00A0a positive impact of 0.6 percentage points as at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 and ends on 27/uni00A0June/uni00A02021.\n\nThe current leverage ratio requirements will be amended by/uni00A0CRR2, which introduces a binding leverage ratio\n\nrequirement of at least 3% and amends the requirements for calculating the exposure measure. The amendment includes the application of SA-CCR to clearing guarantees on derivative exposures. ABN/uni00A0AMRO estimates that the cumulative effect of the CRR2 adjustments, including application of SA-CCR, will lower the exposure measure by approximately EUR/uni00A056.9 billion and equals 0.6/uni00A0percentage points of the leverage ratio. As the temporary measure to exempt central bank reserves ends on 27/uni00A0June/uni00A02021 and CRR2 applies from 28/uni00A0June/uni00A02021 onwards, we currently estimate these two effects will largely be offset, with no/uni00A0material impact on the leverage ratio.

The CRR2 leverage ratio/uni00A0(including SA-CCR) would be 5.8% if central bank reserves were to continue being exempted from the exposure measure.\n\nGoing forward, ABN/uni00A0AMRO will monitor and report the leverage ratio based on currently applicable rules and CRR2, and we expect the leverage ratio to remain above the anticipated regulatory requirements.\n\nThe exposure measure is reported to the Asset and Liability/uni00A0Committee (ALCO) at the business line level and monitored closely in order to ensure the leverage ratio remains within the bank's risk appetite. The leverage ratio outlook takes account of business-specific plans, as well as/uni00A0macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments and capital-related uncertainties.

        "page_content": "## Sustainability risk\n\nThe sustainability risk review provides an in-depth overview of three important components of sustainability risk management. Firstly, we provide more details on due diligence for individual clients considered high risk from a/uni00A0sustainability perspective and on the role of the second line of defence in this respect. Secondly, more information is provided on various analyses that were performed to assess the climate risk of portfolios in sectors that are considered highly sensitive to climate risk. Thirdly, we provide insight into how greenhouse gas emissions are measured and steered. The latter two are in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\n## Advice on increased sustainability risk\n\nCertain industries face more sustainability risks than others, while the nature of these risks also varies considerably. Sustainability risk analysts in the credit risk department provide advice on clients operating in industries with a higher sustainability risk profile. These analysts are the second line of defence for environmental, social and ethical risks. Sustainability risk assessments are done as part of/uni00A0two processes: KYC (assessing the client relationship as/uni00A0a/uni00A0whole) and, in the event of a lending relationship, credit/uni00A0risk assessments.\n\nSustainability risk management for corporate clients is integrated in the due diligence and risk processes of the/uni00A0bank. The first line of defence is responsible for managing these risks. In cases where the client's activities or performance lead to a high sustainability risk profile, the/uni00A0second line provides expert advice to the relevant decision-making authority. In most cases, this advice is fully integrated in the client or credit decisions. If a client does not fully meet our Sustainability Risk Policy framework, the second line will either advise negatively on the relationship/ credit or accept it subject to conditions. In most cases, conditions are set. This is in line with the bank's inclusive strategy. Conditions are set in order to become or remain comfortable that the client is moving towards full compliance and usually consist of monitoring, client engagement or a/uni00A0combination of the two. The processes are described in/uni00A0more detail below.\n\n## Know Your Client (KYC)\n\nFor all corporate clients, sustainability risk due diligence takes place at the moment of onboarding (Client Acceptance) and subsequently in periodic reviews. Sometimes, eventdriven reviews are performed. In the KYC process, the Detecting Financial Crime (DFC) analysts screen for sustainability risk triggers. In the event of a potentially high sustainability risk, DFC sends the file to the second line.\n\nThis happened 433 times in 2020. Out of these, there were/uni00A0102 cases where a high sustainability risk was found and where formal advice was issued by the second line.\n\n## Sustainability risk assessments related to lending\n\nIn lending relationships, a more extensive sustainability assessment takes place. In the case of these relationships, assessments take place at the moment of loan origination and are repeated in periodic (usually annual) monitoring. ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies specific policy requirements for its lending clients in nine high-risk sectors. Each sector is divided into multiple subsectors and activities at different places in the supply chain and matched with specific requirements. The first line of defence assesses the level/uni00A0of/uni00A0clients' compliance with these policies, and the second line validates these assessments. In the event of/uni00A0insufficient comfort, for example due to a major policy gap or incident, a high-intensity engagement trajectory can/uni00A0be started for a maximum of three years or the second line will issue negative advice. In 2020, advice on a lending relationship was given on 274 occasions.\n\n## Sustainability risk advice in 2020\n\nIn 2020, 376 cases were identified with a high sustainability risk profile and where expert advice was consequently required from the second line. In 12 of these cases, the advice given by the second line was negative, while 178 cases were approved and 186 cases were approved subject to conditions.\n\n## Conclusion of advice\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate Risk Management\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is strongly committed to implementing the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2019, we took our first steps in using scenario analysis to measure and disclose the climate risk in our residential mortgages and upstream oil and gas portfolios. In 2020 we continued working to improve these analyses and extended the use of climate\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The heatmap shows material sectors in terms of sensitivity to transition or physical climate risks and corporate lending exposure. The sectors in the heatmap are subsectors of the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) segments, as presented in the Credit risk section. This higher level of granularity allowed us to consider varieties of climate risk sensitivity within sectors. The strategy review\n\n## Climate sensitivity\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Climate sensitivity is the average between physical and transition sensitivity.\n\n## Exposure per sector and inherent sensitivity to climate risk\n\nWhere the heatmap focuses on the inherent vulnerability of/uni00A0a sector to climate risk, the scenario analyses then focus on measuring the actual climate risk of our portfolios in these sectors. The overview presented below shows the methodologies used and the insights obtained from these scenario analyses so far.\n\n## Residential and Commercial Real Estate\n\nIn 2019, we analysed the physical risk associated with flooding (causing direct damage) and drought (causing damage through decreasing ground water levels and foundation pole rot) of our Dutch mortgage portfolio. In/uni00A02020, we improved the portfolio analysis by including more granular pole rot data provided by Kennis Centrum Aanpak Funderingsproblematiek (KCAF). We also performed a similar analysis on commercial real estate to examine the/uni00A0effects of flooding and drought on the collateral value of/uni00A0our commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nEAD in EUR billion\n\n## Flooding\n\nIn 2019, the analysis showed that relatively few properties had a significant risk of flooding (probabilities ranging from 1/300-1/30). The analysis in 2020 showed that the/uni00A0climate risk/uni00A0in our mortgage portfolio at year-end 2020 was not significantly higher or lower than at year-end 2019. The picture showed by commercial real estate (CRE) assets was/uni00A0similar to that of residential mortgages in terms of probabilities. From a damage perspectve, however, the variance was found to be much greater. Among other things, this is because of the greater variety in asset types in commercial real estate and the corresponding calculation of damage. For residential mortgages, we used the damage calculation provided by Deltares ('Standaard Schade en Slachtoffer Module 2017') for residential buildings, whereas for commercial real estate we used Deltares' damage calculations for other asset types such as retail properties, industrial real estate and healthcare premises.\n\nwas announced in 2020 and exposure in some sectors started to decrease. Although the actual and foreseen decreases in these sectors have not yet impacted the list/uni00A0of/uni00A0priority sectors, they have been taken into account in/uni00A0the/uni00A0further scenario analyses. It was decided to repeat/uni00A0the heatmap exercise on a regular basis to reflect changes in exposure, and also new insights into climate risk/uni00A0vulnerabilities.\n\nThis figure shows the heatmap of climate risk sensitivity, based on the lending exposure in the sector and the sector's inherent sensitivity to climate risk.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The applied scenarios contained flooding events of different magnitudes (0.5 and 2 metres) affecting the macroeconomy, and specifically including the Dutch house price index. The outcome showed a substantial increase in credit risk, with/uni00A0increasingly adverse implications of the scenarios. We/uni00A0plan to perform more stress testing on other portfolios and climate risks in 2021. The objective is to develop a methodology that can ultimately be included in the regular stress testing cycle.\n\n## Drought, subsidence and pole rot\n\nFor the mortgage portfolio we used the new 2020 data from KCAF. These new data are significantly more granular and show greater variety in terms of the probability of foundation issues and subsidence for the properties in our/uni00A0portfolio. As the/uni00A0availability and quality of data are continually improving, we have to regularly update our/uni00A0analyses.\n\nCompared to the analysis in 2019, the number of properties/uni00A0with a high or very high probability of pole rot and subsidence has increased. The effect of this at a bank level has required additional research. Based on property and client characteristics we are now working to identify the clients that are most vulnerable to this risk and have started strategic discussions internally to develop mitigation measures and create a positive impact for these vulnerable client groups in particular.\n\nThe new KCAF data will be available for our CRE portfolio from 2021 onwards. In 2020 we therefore used the older, less granular data to create an initial overview of the risks. As our commercial real estate portfolio is smaller and much more concentrated in the Randstad area, the picture it portrays is somewhat different from that of the mortgage portfolio. A relatively high percentage (approximately 21%) of the CRE collateral has a high probability (up to 30%) of pole rot and subsidence. Once the new KCAF data can also be used for CRE, and if strategic mitigating actions are needed, we will be able to determine the overall impact on the bank.\n\nThis map shows all the properties in our mortgage portfolio in the Netherlands and their risk of pole rot and subsidence occurring within the next 30 years.\n\n## Wooden pole rot risk the coming 30 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is an important factor as the assets in the/uni00A0CRE portfolio are a source of income for the owners and tenants. This aspect will also be included in the analysis in 2021. In addition, and contrary to the mortgage portfolio, multiple clients in the CRE portfolio own multiple assets. We also plan, therefore, to include the concentration risk in/uni00A0our portfolio and also in clients' portfolios in the analysis in 2021.\n\nTo examine the financial impact for the bank - and in line with regulatory expectations - a preliminary assessment of how the potential damage impacts our risk-weighted assets is being performed. These insights will be considered when climate risk is further integrated into our risk management policies and practices.\n\n## Shipping\n\nGiven the large volumes of goods that can be transported by one vessel, shipping can be considered relatively cost-/uni00A0and GHG-efficient compared to other modes of transportation such as road or air. Nevertheless the sector is responsible for approximately 2.5% of global GHG emissions. Given the expected growth in international trade, and hence in the demand for transport, this could increase to 10% in 2050, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This would/uni00A0undermine the\n\nParis Agreement. The IMO has therefore set targets to reduce GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 ('the IMO Absolute Target') and CO2 emissions per/uni00A0transport work by at least 40% by 2030, with efforts to/uni00A0achieve a 70% reduction by 2050 compared to 2008 ('the IMO Intensity Targets').\n\nOur analysis in 2020 focused on seagoing vessels and their/uni00A0alignment with the IMO targets. We assumed that the/uni00A0value of the collateral securing our shipping exposure may be reduced by the need for fleets to be more fuelefficient and less carbon-dependent in order to achieve these targets. Two measures were used to assess alignment: the Rightship rating and the Poseidon Principles.\n\n## Rightship rating\n\nBased on ship design and engine performance the Rightship rating measures a ship's theoretical CO2 emissions performance. It is presented using the standard European energy efficiency scale: the relative performance of a vessel is given a rating of A to G, with the most efficient being A and the least efficient being G. The ratings is relative to other vessels. Almost all the vessels we finance have a Rightship rating. The table below shows the exposure per risk label, based on the/uni00A0June/uni00A02020 fleet data. We assume that the most efficient vessels are best-positioned to align with the IMO target.\n\nThis table shows the normal (global) label distribution, as well as the label distribution within the ABN/uni00A0AMRO portfolio.\n\n| Labels   | Normal distribution   | ABN AMRO   |\n|----------|-----------------------|------------|\n| 2.5%     | 6.0%                  | A          |\n| 13.5%    | 26.0%                 | B          |\n| C        | 12.0%                 | 16.0%      |\n| 36.0%    | 36.0%                 | D          |\n| 16.0%    | 13.0%                 | E          |\n| 13.5%    | 7.0%                  | F          |\n| 2.50%    | 0.0%                  | G          |\n\n## Poseidon Principles\n\nThe Poseidon Principles measure alignment by comparing carbon intensity relative to the IMO decarbonisation trajectories. In contrast to the Rightship ratings, the Poseidon reporting is based on real fuel consumption data. ABN/uni00A0AMRO, one of the founding signatories of the Poseidon Principles, is currently slightly behind on the IMO targets (5% at a portfolio level). A deep dive into the portfolio showed a wide variety among types of vessels and/uni00A0loan portfolios. Engagement has therefore started with those clients whose performance is in need of greatest improvement. A further analysis in 2021 will look into the optimal portfolio composition, taking into account scenarios\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\n## Risk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

We complemented this in 2020 with a quantitative analysis. In accordance with the UNEP FI recommendations, we applied the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and various REMIND scenarios of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to our upstream oil and gas portfolio, using a variety of methodologies.\n\nWe first used a Transition Risk Tool developed by UNEP FI to/uni00A0assess how the portfolio is developing in terms of the probability of default and expected loss. The scenarios showed the greatest variance in the medium term (5-10 years), but all 2\u00baC scenarios showed limited but increasing expected losses in the long term (30 years). As the tenors in our upstream oil and gas portfolio are relatively short, we/uni00A0assume there is time to adapt.\n\nIt is assumed that the adaptation pathway will include an increasing portfolio of renewables. We therefore assessed the required development in the portfolio composition to align with the SDS scenario. In 2021, we will strengthen the analysis by using the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) tool developed for banks by the 2\u00b0 Investing Initiative. An initial exercise using this tool was\n\nperformed in early 2020 to assess the bank's energy portfolios.\n\nLastly, we performed a break-even price analysis, using Rystad data. The purpose of this analysis was to test the resilience of the ABN/uni00A0AMRO portfolio against oil, gas and CO2 prices in the above scenarios. This analysis showed our clients' positions compared to those of the rest of the world in terms of break-even prices and CO2 intensities in 2020. We will complement this analysis in 2021, taking account of developments in break-even prices.\n\n## GHG measuring and steering\n\nFurther steps were taken in respect of measuring and steering GHG emissions. Based on the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology, we measure and report the scope 3 GHG emissions in our lending and investment portfolios. We have also committed to the Science-Based Target Initiative to start steering on carbon reduction in various key portfolios: energy, mortgages, commercial real estate, and investments. In 2020, we analysed the Paris alignment of these portfolios. We plan to/uni00A0publish the results in Q2 2021.\n\nThe table below reflects the scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions from our operations and lending portfolio, expressed in ktons of CO2 equivalent. The definitions of these scopes are based on the GHG protocol of the World Resources Institute (WRI).\n\n## CO2 emissions summary table - totals\n\n| (in ktons)                                       | 2020   | 2019   | Delta   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Total scope 1 1                                  | 6      | 13     | -7      |\n| Total scope 2 2                                  | 3      | 8      | -5      |\n| Total scope 3 - air travel 3                     | 1      | 10     | -9      |\n| Total scope 3 - emissions of lending portfolio 4 | 25,729 | 27,433 | -1,704  |\n| Total scope 3 - emissions of client assets 5     | 6,633  | 7,156  | -523    |\n| Total CO2 Emission                               | 32,373 | 34,621 | -2,248  |\n\n- 1 Natural gas/biogas, solar energy (the Netherlands and rest of world) and mobility lease cars (Netherlands).\n- 2 Electricity (excluding solar energy) and heating & cooling, location based figures provided by energy suppliers (the Netherlands and rest of world).\n\n- 4 Based on PCAF methodology, using total assets as the denominator and EAD as attribution metric.

By virtue of Principle 2.5 (Culture) of the Code, the Executive Board is responsible for/uni00A0promoting a culture aimed at creating long-term value for the company and its affiliated enterprises. By virtue of/uni00A0Principle 2.5.4 (Accountability regarding culture), the Executive Board is required to explain the bank's values and/uni00A0how these values are incorporated into the activities of/uni00A0the company and its affiliated enterprises, and to account for the effectiveness of and the bank's compliance with the/uni00A0Code of Conduct.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal risk management and control process is effectuated by the Executive Board, management and other staff. It is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:\n\n- H effectiveness and efficiency of operations;\n- H reliability of financial and non-financial information;\n- H compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies;\n- H safeguarding of assets, identification and management of liabilities; and\n- H strategic and business objectives.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's first and second lines of defence perform their roles in risk assessments, stress tests, evaluations of/uni00A0the operating effectiveness of controls, and reporting on/uni00A0risk management and control systems. The concluding results are reported in formal risk reports and discussed at/uni00A0senior management level. Group Audit, as the third line of defence, evaluates the design and effectiveness of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's governance, as well as its risk management and control systems. Audit reports are discussed with relevant Executive Committee members. Group Audit attended the Executive Board and/or Executive Committee meetings every quarter to discuss the Quarterly Audit Opinions. In 2020, the evaluation of the adequacy of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal risk management and control systems was regularly discussed with the Audit Committee, the Risk & Capital Committee and the full Supervisory Board.\n\nIn compliance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the/uni00A0Corporate Governance Code (Statement by the management board) and based on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's risk management processes, the Executive Board makes the following statements and provides clear substantiation regarding the internal risk management and control systems, taking into account ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategy of pursuing a/uni00A0moderate risk profile:\n\n- H The Executive Board's report in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's 2020 Annual Report provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and/uni00A0control systems (best practice 1.4.3.i);\n- H The internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting for 2020 does not contain any material inaccuracies (best/uni00A0practice 1.4.3.ii);\n- H Based on the current state of affairs, preparation of the financial reporting for 2020 on a going-concern basis is justified (best practice 1.4.3.iii). For further information, please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements;\n- H The Executive Board's report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to expectations regarding ABN/uni00A0AMRO's continuity for the period of twelve months following the preparation of this report (best practice 1.4.3.iv);\n- H The Executive Board's report explains the bank's values and how they are incorporated into the activities of the/uni00A0company and its affiliated enterprises, and accounts for the effectiveness of and the bank's compliance with the Code of Conduct (best practice 2.5.4)./uni00A0For further information, please refer to Risk culture in the Risk, funding & capital management section.\n\nRegarding internal risk management and control systems, the Executive Board has identified the following external factors as potentially having an impact on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's current business model:\n\n- H As the Covid-19 health crisis continues to affect us all, the well-being of the bank's clients and staff remains its main focus. The bank's strong digital backbone combined with the dedication and flexibility of its staff ensured the services to clients remained consistent and the operating result resilient. The bank strengthened its risk management activities and reporting during the crisis, also in response to the increase in regulatory requirements. Covid-19 has had a significant impact on our financial performance and/uni00A0has resulted in high impairments. The main business continuity measures taken are detailed/uni00A0in Operational (non-financial) risk in the Risk, funding & capital review section of this report. In/uni00A0December 2020, the Netherlands entered into another partial lockdown.

As part of its recent strategy review, the Executive Board has defined client segments and value propositions that will be developed to compensate for these external developments (such as a more fee-based business model and rigorously simplifying and centralising the operating model, enabling the bank to focus on clients and work more efficiently).\n\nNot being compliant with laws and regulations may lead to/uni00A0reputational damage, fines and changes in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's income and costs or capital basis and could endanger long-term goals. Ensuring demonstrable compliance requires robust risk governance, enhanced data management and/uni00A0a/uni00A0substantial share of the bank's resources.\n\nSpecific areas where the risk of non-compliance with regulations and heightened regulatory scrutiny require substantial effort by the bank are:\n\n- H Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), including Customer Due Diligence/ Know Your Client . ABN/uni00A0AMRO is fully cooperating in an/uni00A0investigation by the Dutch Public Prosecutor relating to requirements under the Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism (Wwft). More information on this is provided in the Regulatory environment section, the Non-financial review section and Note 34 Commitments and contingent liabilities in/uni00A0the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements;\n- H Duty of care towards the bank's clients . Good progress was made in the bank-wide Duty of Care framework, reflecting regulatory requirements, regulatory expectations and the bank's duty of care ambition. More information on this is provided in the Crime & integrity disclosure in the Non-financial review in the Strategy & performance section of this report. In addition, the bank is seeing an increased claim risk in respect of variable interest rates for several products, e.g. revolving consumer loans;\n- H Credit Risk Management . Collateral management, credit risk modelling and credit risk monitoring and reporting require/uni00A0remediation. More information on this/uni00A0is provided in the Credit risk management section.\n\nRemediation programmes, related to Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), Duty of care and Credit Risk Management aimed at improving ABN/uni00A0AMRO's performance in these areas, were initiated and were well underway in 2020 in order to remedy shortcomings and ensure full compliance with legislation bank-wide. In 2019, the bank established a centralised Detecting Financial Crime department, started programmes to address potential issues involving products sold in the past (such as consumer credit and mortgages) and further improved the monitoring of regulatory changes and overseeing their implementation. From 2021, the remediation will require a substantial, multi-year effort, especially with regard to the regulatory areas mentioned above. In addition to its remediation programmes, the bank is investing to improve regular processes aimed at ensuring it stays compliant going forward.\n\nIn the past, ABN/uni00A0AMRO's legal predecessor, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V., ABN/uni00A0AMRO and several (former) subsidiaries were directly or indirectly involved in transactions relating to/uni00A0equity trading extending over dividend record dates, including several forms of tainted dividend arbitrage, i.e./uni00A0dividend stripping.\n\nIt cannot be excluded that ABN/uni00A0AMRO or subsidiaries will face financial consequences as a result of their involvement in these transactions, including penalties and other measures under criminal law and civil law claims. The/uni00A0bank has been implementing measures to prevent it from being involved in/uni00A0tainted dividend arbitrage in the future.\n\nMore information on this risk is provided under Note 34 Commitments and contingent liabilities in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nThe Executive Board has identified and agreed on the following six areas for improvement, which are being actively managed by senior management:\n\n- H IT environment: The bank is enhancing its IT landscape via digitalisation and innovation. Substantial efforts are required to improve the IT infrastructure, identity and access management and IT controls to strengthen its/uni00A0cyber posture. These IT issues, combined with a complex IT infrastructure and multiple third parties, may/uni00A0result in ineffective business process execution and/uni00A0missed opportunities in the application of new technologies. The bank is subject to increasing risks from/uni00A0cyber attacks potentially jeopardising confidential data or business processes.\n- H Data management: The financial services industry and its supervision are becoming increasingly data-driven, and data privacy is a key aspect of data management. The bank needs to make substantial efforts in order to/uni00A0improve the control of its data quality and availability so as/uni00A0to meet requirements regarding data aggregation,\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\n## Management Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "data use and risk reporting (e.g. Principles for Effective Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting). These aspects of data management, combined with issues concerning the quality of (historical) data, data ownership, data knowledge and a complex IT infrastructure, may result in suboptimal decision-making and business process execution, as well as in elevated model risk. Data management and preventing data leakage also play an important role in addressing privacy risk. An improved data policy was delivered in 2020, and progress was made in many areas, e.g. strengthening the banks' data quality controls and the data quality issue remediation process. However, data management requires a multi-year approach in order for the bank to reach the desired level.\n\n- H Change accumulation: The complexity, accumulation and interdependencies of the bank's transformation programmes, including all prioritised regulatory changes/ issues and the wind-down of the non-core activities of CIB (exiting all non-European corporate banking activities, except for Clearing), are leading to an accumulation of change risk. This may cause delays, potentially resulting in increased operational costs and time-to-market issues, and the bank possibly lagging behind new entrants. Alignment of these changes has been realised via a revised strategy plan and an improved transition plan and/uni00A0governance to further improve execution discipline. The CIB non-core wind-down to pursue our moderate risk profile is well underway.\n- H External fraud: The continued increase in advanced external crime threats may expose the bank and its clients to cyber fraud attacks, disruptions of in-house and outsourced IT, ATM and sealbag attacks and loan fraud. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is working with crime-fighting authorities and other relevant authorities, as well as with other banks, to tackle these issues. We note that regulatory initiatives are increasingly aimed at protecting clients from payment fraud, even if banks are not liable. For/uni00A0example, the Dutch Parliament recently approved a/uni00A0motion that expects clients to be compensated by banks if they become victims of spoofing by criminals. We expect more duty of care developments and/or\n\nregulations regarding fraud going forward.\n\n- H People and culture: The difficulties of attracting, developing and retaining qualified staff in certain areas remain a point of attention, especially in the context of the lockdown impacting the well-being of staff. This risk is mitigated by various programmes focused on strategic workforce management, culture and leadership in transformation. A further reduction of around 15% of staff is expected by 2024, mostly from 2022 onwards. The impact on staff will be reduced through natural attrition and by reskilling to roles where we expect shortages. These improvements, alongside the implementation of a significant culture change, with focus on performance management and strategy execution and ownership, will help the bank achieve its/uni00A0strategic goals.\n- H Risk Control Framework: The effectiveness of the Risk Control Framework is under continuous improvement to/uni00A0assure management is in control. Management is improving the Risk Control Framework via several additional control-related assessments.\n\nIn the meantime, measures have been taken to minimise and mitigate the risks with regard to all areas of improvement.\n\nIt should be noted that ABN/uni00A0AMRO's internal risk management and control systems do not provide complete assurance on the realisation of business objectives, nor/uni00A0do/uni00A0they prevent or detect inaccuracies, fraud and non-compliance with rules and regulations at all times.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\n## Management Control Statement\n\nAdditional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

maturity profile is based on internally developed liquidity risk models. These models cover residential mortgages, consumer and corporate loans, non-maturing assets (mainly current accounts), credit cards, non-maturing liabilities (demand deposits and current accounts) and term deposits. The liquidity risk models predict the behavioural cash flows, which can differ from the contractual cash flows as a result of, for example, prepayments or because some products do not have a defined contractual maturity date. The models are based on/uni00A0historically observed client behaviour and use\n\na/uni00A0combination of internal and external risk drivers. The/uni00A0models are used for/uni00A0monitoring the bank's liquidity mismatch position.\n\nThe liquidity risk models are included in the bank's model risk management framework. This means that the models have to follow a regular monitoring and validation schedule. Approval of the models is given by the Methodology Acceptance Group (MAG) ALM/T, based on independent advice from Model Validation.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nIntroduction to risk, funding\n\n&/uni00A0capital\n\nRisk, funding & capital/uni00A0management\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\n## Additional risk, funding &/uni00A0capital/uni00A0disclosures\n\nLeadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Introduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nThis section presents ABN/uni00A0AMRO's leadership and corporate governance framework. It provides information on/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO's/uni00A0Executive Board, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board, as well as on its legal structure and remuneration policy. This section also presents the Report of the Supervisory Board for 2020.\n\n## Executive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's management structure includes an Executive Board and an Executive Committee./uni00A0\n\nThe terms of office of the members of the Executive Committee who are not members of the Executive Board were all due to end in/uni00A0March/uni00A02020. These terms were extended by either two or four years in/uni00A0March/uni00A02020. The terms of Frans van der Horst (CEO of Retail Banking) and Pieter van Mierlo (CEO of Private Banking) were extended by two years, while those of Daphne de Kluis (CEO of Commercial Banking) and Rutger van Nouhuijs (CEO of Corporate & Institutional Banking) were extended by four years. The bank has opted for staggered terms to ensure that members of the Executive Committee are not all up for/uni00A0reappointment at the same time.\n\nOn 22 April 2020, the Supervisory Board appointed Robert Swaak as the new CEO of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Kees van Dijkhuizen's term as CEO expired at the Annual General Meeting on 22 April 2020 as he announced his intention not to serve a new term of office. The Employee Council and NLFI issued a positive advice on Robert Swaak's appointment.\n\nGerard Penning was appointed as the new Chief Human Resources Officer and a member of the Executive Committee from 1/uni00A0August/uni00A02020. A search process for a new Executive Committee member responsible for HR was started after Gert-Jan Meppelink stepped down as Executive Committee member responsible for the bank's HR, Transformation & Communications (HTC) by mutual agreement in response to the proposed decision to regroup the HTC portfolio in view of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's strategy. Interim\n\narrangements were put in place for the period until the appointment (and start) of the new Executive Committee member to ensure continuity of decision-making.\n\nOn 17/uni00A0November/uni00A02020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced that Clifford Abrahams, CFO of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and Vice-Chairman of the Executive Board and Executive Committee, would leave the bank with effect from 28 February 2021 to pursue an/uni00A0opportunity closer to home in the UK. The Supervisory Board then started an external search for a new CFO, resulting in the Supervisory Board's nomination of Lars Kramer to succeed Clifford Abrahams as ABN/uni00A0AMRO's CFO. His appointment is subject to approval by the ECB. Until that time, Annemieke Roest, Head of Controlling at/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO, will serve as acting CFO./uni00A0\n\n## Role and responsibilities of the Executive Board\n\nThe Executive Board is the statutory managing board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO within the meaning of Section 2:129 of the Dutch Civil Code. It is responsible for (i) the general course of business of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations and the adequate financing of its activities; (ii) the continuity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business, aimed at long-term value creation for ABN/uni00A0AMRO and taking into account interests of stakeholders, and (iii) setting ABN/uni00A0AMRO's mission, vision, strategy, risk appetite, corporate standards and values, risk framework, main policies, budgets, financial and non-financial targets, and for the realisation thereof. In respect of these duties, and to/uni00A0the extent they relate to ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries, the Executive Board consults the Executive Committee, without prejudice to the Executive Board's statutory collective management responsibilities.

The Executive Board is accountable to the Supervisory Board and to the General Meeting for the performance of its duties. In/uni00A0performing its duties, the Executive Board develops a/uni00A0view on long-term value creation for ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its/uni00A0business and considers relevant stakeholder interests.\n\n## Role and responsibilities of the Executive Committee\n\nThe Executive Committee is part of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's 'management body' (together with the Supervisory Board) as defined in CRD V and has duties and responsibilities that have been delegated to it by the Executive Board. The Executive Committee is entrusted with the effective direction of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries. The Executive Committee is specifically mandated to ensure that ABN/uni00A0AMRO's mission, vision, strategy, policies, annual budget, risk appetite, standards and values, and financial and non-financial targets are translated into specific group-aligned strategies, policies, budgets, risk appetites, standards and performance targets for each business line, with the aim of contributing to long-term value creation by ABN/uni00A0AMRO, and building and maintaining the culture required for that purpose. The respective members of the Executive Committee are also responsible for the daily management of their own business lines.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Committee helps define the strategic direction of the bank: the Executive Board is required to consult the Executive Committee in respect of decisions regarding the bank's (i) mission, vision and strategy, and (ii) risk policies, risk appetite framework and statement. The Executive Committee ensures an open dialogue with the Supervisory Board, both on specific issues and in general, in order to inform the Supervisory Board adequately. The Executive Committee provides the Supervisory Board and its committees with all the information they need for the proper performance of their supervisory duties and as requested by the Supervisory Board through the Chairman of the Executive Committee.\n\nIn the execution of its duties, the Executive Committee focuses on client centricity, the activities and needs of the business lines, transformation, innovation, digitalisation and sustainable growth of operating income, and promotes the values of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries through leading by example.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nThe Executive Board consists of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and the Chief Innovation & Technology Officer (CI&TO). The Executive Committee is chaired by the CEO and consists of the four statutory Executive Board members and five non-statutory senior executives, including four business line roles (Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Private Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking) and one role with bank-wide responsibilities (HR & Transformation). The management structure is thus designed to create an enhanced focus on the bank's business activities at a senior executive level.\n\nThe Executive Committee's composition is based on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's guiding principle that diversity of thought, expertise, background, competences and interpersonal styles, including but not limited to gender diversity, is a prerequisite for effective management and, by extension, for long-term value creation. In line with ABN/uni00A0AMRO's diversity policy, ABN/uni00A0AMRO strives to meet the gender target of/uni00A0 at least 30% for the Executive Committee and Executive Board. Gender diversity within the Executive Committee at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 was 22%, and 25% within the Executive Board. When vacancies arise, ABN/uni00A0AMRO gives due consideration to any applicable gender requirements in its search for suitable new members who meet the fit and proper requirements stipulated in the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.\n\nThe Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and the Executive Committee are available on abnamro.com.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Introduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board is responsible for ABN/uni00A0AMRO's long-term value creation, requiring members to execute their duties in a sustainable manner with due observance of the long-term viability of the strategy being pursued. In discharging its task, the Supervisory Board takes into account the dynamics and the relationship between the Executive Board and the Executive Committee and its members. The Supervisory Board's early and close involvement with the Executive Board is required when formulating the bank-wide strategy and targets in line with the pursued culture aimed at long-term value creation.\n\nIn performing their duties, the members of the Supervisory Board are guided by the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its businesses, taking due consideration of the legitimate interests of all of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's stakeholders (such as its clients, savers and deposit holders, shareholders, holders of/uni00A0depositary receipts, employees and the society in which/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates). Certain decisions taken by/uni00A0the Executive Board are subject to the approval of the/uni00A0Supervisory Board.\n\n## Changes in 2020\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of 22 April 2020, Arjen Dorland was reappointed to the Supervisory Board for a period of four years, Jurgen Stegmann was reappointed to the Supervisory Board for a period of three years and Tjalling Tiemstra was reappointed to the Supervisory Board for a period of two years.

No other changes in the Supervisory Board were made during 2020.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nThe Supervisory Board's composition is based on the guiding principle that diversity of thought, expertise, background, competences and interpersonal styles, including but not limited to gender diversity, is a prerequisite for effective supervision and, by extension, for long-term value creation. In line with its diversity policy, ABN/uni00A0AMRO strives to meet the gender target of at least 30% for the Supervisory Board. Gender diversity within ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Supervisory Board is currently 37.5%. When vacancies arise, the Supervisory Board gives due consideration to any applicable gender requirements in its search for suitable new members meeting the fit and proper requirements stipulated in the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.

In addition, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Committee jointly had five strategy meetings. The Supervisory Board had five informal meetings.\n\nRegular Supervisory Board meetings take place following the meetings of the Remuneration Committee, Selection & Nomination Committee, Risk & Capital Committee and the Audit Committee. These committees report to the Supervisory Board on their deliberations and findings after their meeting, and the Supervisory Board takes into account their outcomes and recommendations. The/uni00A0Company Secretary (or deputy Company Secretary) attends all meetings and is the secretary to the Supervisory Board and its committees. The Executive Board attends the regular meetings of the Supervisory Board and prepares detailed supporting documents. The regular meetings take four hours on average. Other bank staff and the internal and external auditor are frequently invited to give presentations on specific topics such as performance highlights, the capital & funding plan, dividend payments, strategy, an investor relations update, the risk appetite, quarterly risk reports, quarterly audit reports and quarterly compliance reports. This year, a large number of additional meetings were held to discuss the Covid-19 situation and the impact on the bank. These meetings were also attended by the Executive Board. The CEO, CFO and CI&TO provided updates on the Covid-19 related developments in their domain. Each meeting was attended by a CEO of one of the business lines to provide the Supervisory Board with a/uni00A0business lines update on Covid-19-related developments. Within the CRO update, the latest risk developments memo\n\nprepared by Risk Management was discussed. The new CIB strategy focuses on Northwest Europe and its aspirations were discussed and approved./uni00A0The review of the bank's strategy was discussed at five joint meetings with the Executive Board and Executive Committee. The outcomes of the strategy review were discussed and approved during an additional meeting of the Supervisory Board. It was decided that ABN/uni00A0AMRO would continue to evolve its purpose and the three pillars of the existing strategy.\n\nIn addition to the regular subjects, the meetings focused on specific subjects such as the Executive Committee's succession planning, particularly the succession of the CEO, CHRO and the CFO and the appointment of the new Supervisory Board member. Another important subject discussed by/uni00A0the Supervisory Board was the investigation by the Dutch public prosecutor. The suitability selfassessments of the management body were extensively debated. Other topics on the agenda were the financial plan for 2021-2025, monitoring of the progress in the areas of improvement identified in the performance evaluation of 2019, the duty of care, and ancillary positions of Supervisory Board members and members of the Executive/uni00A0Committee.\n\nDetails of the composition of the Supervisory Board throughout 2020 can be found in the Composition and diversity paragraph in the Supervisory Board section. The/uni00A0personal details of the members of the Supervisory Board are considered to be incorporated, by reference, in/uni00A0this Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAttendance of the Supervisory Board members at the Board's meetings in 2020 was as follows:\n\n| 2020                |   Formal   meetings (6) |   Additional   meetings (33) |   Total meetings (39) | Attendance (%)   |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| T. de Swaan (chair) |                       6 |                           33 |                    39 | 100%             |\n| A.C.

Regarding the regulatory environment, ABN/uni00A0AMRO\n\ncontinued to work on retaining trust and only making proper use of client data. On 25/uni00A0September/uni00A02019, the Dutch public prosecutor informed ABN/uni00A0AMRO that the bank was the subject of an investigation relating to requirements under\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\n## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "the Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism (Wwft). The public prosecutor is investigating whether ABN/uni00A0AMRO has complied with the requirements of the Wwft and ABN/uni00A0AMRO is cooperating fully with the investigation. The developments with regard to the investigation were extensively discussed by the Supervisory Board during the year. The Detecting Financial Crime department provided the Supervisory Board with regular updates on the progress made as the licence to operate was an important subject during the year under review.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was also regularly updated on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's key financial and non-financial risks and the design of the internal risk management and control systems. During these updates the Executive Board's assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and control systems was monitored and discussed. Given the Covid-19 pandemic and related lockdowns, Risk Management played a key role in preparing the latest risk developments memo outlining the Covid-19 implications for ABN/uni00A0AMRO from a risk perspective. This memo included topics such as enterprise risk management, liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk and operational risk and was often and extensively discussed during meetings of the Supervisory Board. The bank's risk appetite and ICAAP/ ILAAP were also discussed and approved. In addition, the Supervisory Board had in-depth discussions on material legal, credit, tax and compliance files. The AFM activities report, DNB-ECB activities report, ERM report and policy approval report were also discussed each quarter.\n\nIn/uni00A0March/uni00A02020, the bank launched a review to define the new CIB strategy and to detail the future blueprint of the business model. This is aimed at achieving healthy returns and medium/long-term sustainability within ABN/uni00A0AMRO's moderate risk profile, while also enhancing its strategy and purpose. Potential directions and choices were discussed during the meetings between the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board. The new strategy for CIB was announced on 12/uni00A0August/uni00A02020. Going forward, CIB will focus on clients in Northwest Europe and Clearing. In Q3 2020, the strategy review was extensively debated with the Executive Committee. The starting point was to further evolve the three pillars of the existing strategy and not to change the purpose of the bank. The important items to be decided on with regard to ABN/uni00A0AMRO's new vision and strategic priorities include data and digital, sustainability, client centricity and focus segments. The Supervisory Board had various meetings with the Executive Committee to discuss and challenge these items. The licence to operate is key in the refreshed strategy, and the transition plan safeguards the core regulatory initiatives.\n\nThe Supervisory Board continued to actively engage with/uni00A0its key stakeholders in 2020, mainly by way of digital meetings, in order to obtain client and staff feedback\n\nregarding the bank's duty of care, integrity, client focus, culture and competitive differentiation. The two members appointed pursuant to the enhanced recommendation right of the Employee Council, Laetitia Griffith and Arjen Dorland, met regularly with the Employee Council throughout the year to maintain an active dialogue and obtain the Employee Council's thoughts and input on various matters, including diversity, work satisfaction, the strategy review and the new target operating model. The Chairman and other members of the Supervisory Board also met with the Employee Council on several formal and informal occasions during the year. These included the annual half-day threecouncil meeting of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Committee and the Employee Council ( drie raden overleg ) held on 29/uni00A0October/uni00A02020. The objectives for this meeting were i) to recognise and understand what has made us successful in bank-wide collaboration in the past, ii) to jointly share and discuss the shared point of view on how to take these positive lessons on board so as to move towards strategy execution, and iii) to use the exploration of this theme as a vehicle for further strengthening the collaboration and the shared story of the strategy review (and the subsequent transition and execution). The Supervisory Board appreciates the constructive relationship it has with the Employee Council, and highly values the input, engagement, suggestions and considerations provided by the Employee Council in the interests of the bank. Active engagement was also maintained throughout the year with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), the European Central Bank (ECB), the AFM, STAK AAB and NLFI. The Supervisory Board's aim continues to be to ensure that the bank is well positioned to create long-term value for its shareholders and for society, while focusing firmly on clients' interests and balancing the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nIn/uni00A0October/uni00A02019, the Supervisory Board and Executive Board established a joint temporary committee, as referred to in the Supervisory Board's and Executive Board's Rules of Procedure. This committee coordinates, advises on and supervises the main activities following the investigation initiated by the Dutch public prosecutor regarding the possible breach of the Wwft. The committee has only an assisting and advisory function and does not replace or change the regular governance structure and procedures in/uni00A0place for ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nOn 15/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, at the Extraordinary General Meeting of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, Mariken Tannemaat was appointed as the eighth Supervisory Board member. The Supervisory Board nominated her because she meets the profile requirements of the Supervisory Board, in particular with regard to her extensive knowledge, and executive experience, in the field of innovation and digitalisation. The/uni00A0Supervisory Board regards her as a welcome addition to the Supervisory Board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\n## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Audit Committee also monitored the effects of the measures taken by ABN/uni00A0AMRO to limit the negative impact of the pandemic on its clients, such as the payment holidays. The Audit Committee continually paid attention to current and future operational results, also in view of the low interest rate environment. In addition, the Committee discussed the audit ratings of the bank's first and second line departments every quarter. During each meeting the Committee devoted attention to the procedures for financial reporting, including the procedure for establishing loan impairments, the timelines for establishing impairments, and the robustness and development of the financial results and ratios, including the level of loan impairments.

In addition, when deemed relevant and useful, individual staff members and responsible management were invited to present their case, respond to questions and participate in discussions.\n\nThe R&CC held twelve plenary meetings in 2020, four of which were regular meetings and eight of which were additional meetings. These additional meetings were held to discuss (i) the annual ICAAP and ILAAP submission, (ii) progress on specific compliance-related topics and (iii) detecting financial crime. All matters discussed in the R&CC's plenary meeting that were relevant for the Supervisory Board were reported on orally at the subsequent meetings of the full Supervisory Board. The/uni00A0full/uni00A0Supervisory Board also received minutes of/uni00A0the/uni00A0R&CC meetings.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\n## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure Codes and regulations Legal structure Remuneration report Responsibility statement\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, the CRO and CFO provided quarterly updates at the regular R&CC meetings on relevant developments in their/uni00A0respective areas of control.\n\nThe ERM Report provides a concise overview of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's position on all risk types identified in the risk taxonomy. It also aims to identify cross-risk type issues and effects and to provide a single integrated view on the bank's risk profile, benchmarked against the bank's strategy and risk appetite (which is established annually by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board after obtaining advice from the R&CC). Other important subjects included in the ERM Report are the bank's largest single exposures and lessons learned in relation to specific impairments. Based on the ERM Report, the R&CC also discussed Covid-19 related risks and matters related to interest rate risk, change risks, model risks, operational risks, compliance risks and credit risks. The ERM Report and all other regular and one-off reports were used by the R&CC to maintain oversight and advise the Executive Board on the operation and efficiency of the bank's operations versus its risk appetite, including the functioning of its internal Risk Management function.\n\nEvery quarter, the R&CC assessed the updated Capital & Funding Plans and was informed about the bank's current capital and funding positions. The R&CC discussed the bank's management of its capital and liquidity ratios, including the issuance plans for capital and funding and options for RWA steering. In all instances, the R&CC advised the Supervisory Board to approve the Capital & Funding Plan.\n\nBased on the quarterly Compliance and Legal Reports, the R&CC discussed individual Legal, Tax and Compliance files, the performance of the Compliance function, Compliance policies and procedures, the relationship with the supervisory authorities and the impact of national and international laws\n\nand regulations. Examples of files that were discussed include cum/ex-related legacy issues (i.e./uni00A0dividend stripping), the investigation by the Dutch public prosecutor related to requirements under the Dutch Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism, complaints relating to Euribor-based mortgages and interest rate derivatives for SME clients. Lastly, the R&CC discussed the annual plans of the Compliance and Legal departments.\n\nThe R&CC was informed of the bank's correspondence and development of the relationship with the Dutch Central Bank, the European Central Bank, the AFM and other relevant supervisory authorities in quarterly oversight reports prepared by Legal and Compliance.\n\nThe R&CC also paid specific attention to the reformulated risk appetite of the bank, also in the light of the ongoing strategy discussions, and the risk enhancement programme for AACB. The R&CC has a continuing focus on compliancerelated matters, and particularly on the duty of care, client due diligence and anti-money laundering and the countering of terrorism financing.\n\nThe activities of the Detecting Financial Crime unit were also discussed at various R&CC meetings, when the R&CC zoomed in on transaction monitoring and the DFC activities of several of the bank's subsidiaries. The R&CC also discussed the cash improvement plan and was periodically updated on the remediation programmes and the CIB non-core risk governance. Given the prominence of these subjects, the R&CC expects to continue devoting substantial attention to various DFC-related topics in 2021.\n\nMore information on the risk, capital, liquidity and fundingrelated topics discussed in the R&CC is provided in the Risk, funding & capital chapter.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for supervising, and advising the complete Supervisory Board on, such things as (i) remuneration policies and their execution for members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and selected members of senior management, and (ii) reporting on the execution of the bank's remuneration policies in a remuneration report.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\n## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

A link to the strategy, long-term values and sustainability has been added to comply with the new Shareholders Rights Directive (SRD II). With regard to the Executive Board remuneration policy, performance criteria based on financial and non-financial measures were included. The remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board was a new policy and includes an increase in the annual fixed fee for Supervisory Board members, with annual indexation in accordance with the Dutch general banks' collective labour agreement (no indexation had been applied since 2010). Both policies were adopted at the Annual General Meeting on 22 April 2020. The remuneration report was published separately, following the new SRD II regulation.\n\nAnother important subject discussed by the Remuneration Committee was the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on people. One element of these discussions was whether targets in/uni00A0the KPI framework for 2020 needed to be changed. The/uni00A0Remuneration Committee advised not to change these/uni00A0targets. The Covid-19 crisis certainly impacted on the/uni00A0awarding of variable remuneration for 2020 and, after extensive debate, it was decided to limit this. Other items on the Remuneration Committee's agenda included strategic workforce management to ensure people are adaptable and stay fit for the future, diversity and inclusion focusing on gender and cultural diversity (for which targets have been set), the bank-wide Global Reward Policy and retention packages related to divestments in view of the\n\nupdated CIB strategy. Lastly, the annual end-of-year topics such as the 2019 performance management review and KPI setting for 2020 were discussed, along with the outcomes of the Employee Engagement Survey, which showed positive developments across the bank.\n\n## Selection & Nomination Committee\n\nThe Selection & Nomination Committee is responsible for supervising, and advising the complete Supervisory Board on, such things as (i) the selection, appointments and reappointments regarding the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, (ii) succession plans of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, (iii) the knowledge, skills, experience, performance, size, composition and profile of/uni00A0these boards, and (iv) the performance of the members of these boards.\n\nIn 2020, the Selection & Nomination Committee held four formal meetings and seventeen additional meetings. One decision was made without a meeting being held. The Company Secretary (or deputy Company Secretary) attended the meetings. In accordance with stricter legislation, the Supervisory Board will continue in 2021 to/uni00A0ratify all decisions made by the Selection & Nomination Committee either at a meeting or in writing without a meeting being held.\n\nAttendance of the Selection & Nomination Committee members at the Committee's meetings (from 12/uni00A0November/uni00A02019) was as follows:\n\n| 2020                |   Formal   meetings (4) |   Additional   meetings (17) |   Total meetings (21) | Attendance (%)   |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| T. de Swaan (chair) |                       4 |                           17 |                    21 | 100%             |\n| A.C.

        "page_content": "The main topics that the Selection & Nomination Committee discussed and provided advice on to the Supervisory Board related to successors for the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Compliance Officer and lastly the Chief Financial Officer, who announced his decision to leave with effect from 28/uni00A0February/uni00A02021. Another important subject was succession management, consisting of the people review and position management. Talents were assessed in the people review, while successors for key positions (Executive Board, Executive Committee and the management level below) were identified during position management.\n\nIn addition, the Selection & Nomination Committee discussed the nominations for reappointing three Supervisory Board members whose terms of office were due to end in April 2020; the nomination for appointing an eighth Supervisory Board member, taking into account the diversity policy for management bodies and experience in the areas of IT and innovation; the assessment of various ancillary positions of members of the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Committee and lastly the envisaged reappointment of two Executive Board members whose terms of office are due to end in April 2021.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nIn Q4 2019, the annual assessment of the Executive Board, the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board Committees for the 2019 performance year was carried out externally. The functioning of the Executive Board and Executive Committee and its members was assessed on the basis of interviews with all members of the Executive Board and Executive Committee, as well as key individuals within ABN/uni00A0AMRO, and discussions at their meetings, which were evaluated by the Supervisory Board. The assessment of the Supervisory Board, its individual members and committees was based on interviews with all members of the Supervisory Board, as well as key individuals within ABN/uni00A0AMRO, and discussions within the Supervisory Board. Areas of improvement identified on the basis of these assessments and evaluations included a joint focus on long-term rather than short-term solutions, the history-based corporate culture and optimisation of the use of time. These areas were also addressed and discussed in/uni00A0reflection sessions during 2020.\n\nThe assessments of the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Committee for the 2020 performance year will be carried out in 2021, with due observance of succession planning.\n\n## Induction Programme and Lifelong Learning Programme\n\n## Induction Programme\n\nFollowing their appointment, all new members of the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Committee complete an extensive induction programme designed to ensure they have the relevant knowledge needed to fulfil their role, including thorough knowledge of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business activities, financial reporting of the group ABN/uni00A0AMRO belongs to and general financial, social, risk, compliance and legal matters. In view of the different knowledge, background and experience of newly appointed members of these boards, each induction programme has a tailor-made curriculum.\n\n## Lifelong Learning Programme\n\nA lifelong learning programme is in place for members of/uni00A0the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Committee. This is designed to keep their expertise up-to-date and to broaden and deepen their knowledge, where necessary. The objective is for members of the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Committee to participate in the same training sessions so as to foster knowledge-sharing. The curriculum is developed and updated continually to ensure the programme is of high quality, covers developments related to regulatory requirements and takes into account current developments in the global financial industry. Topics covered in 2020 and attended by the Supervisory Board, together with the Executive Board and Executive Committee, included regulatory compliance, Europe's circular economy, detecting financial crime, the duty of care, data sharing and open banking, viable business models and digitalisation, adaptability, client data protection, customer and employee experience, and in-depth sessions on anti-money laundering, ethics and leadership.\n\nThe Lifelong Learning Programme was adapted to accommodate the measures taken in relation to Covid-19 and, as a result, all sessions between March and December were offered online.\n\n## Introduction\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\n## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

On that date, NLFI held 56.3% in the share capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO, of which 49.9% was directly held via ordinary shares and 6.4% was indirectly held via depositary receipts for shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. On that date, STAK/uni00A0AAB held 50.1% of the shares in the issued capital of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Only STAK AAB's depositary receipts have been issued with the cooperation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and are traded on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\n## NLFI\n\nThe Dutch State holds an interest in ABN/uni00A0AMRO through NLFI. NLFI was set up to avoid potential conflicting responsibilities that the Dutch Minister of Finance might otherwise face and to avoid undesired political influence being exerted. NLFI holds 56.3% in ABN/uni00A0AMRO, of which 49.9% is directly held via ordinary shares and 6.4% is indirectly held via depositary receipts for shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO issued by STAK AAB. NLFI is responsible for managing these shares and depositary receipts and for exercising all rights associated with these shares under Dutch law, including voting rights.\n\nNLFI acts as a stand-alone shareholder that is independent of the Dutch State, including the Dutch Ministry of Finance. However, important decisions taken by NLFI require prior approval by the Dutch Minister of Finance, who can also give binding voting instructions to NLFI with respect to such decisions. NLFI is not permitted to dispose of or encumber\n\nthe ordinary shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO without the/uni00A0authorisation of the Dutch Minister of Finance.\n\nNLFI entered into a Relationship Agreement with ABN/uni00A0AMRO governing their relationship after the initial public offering (IPO). The full text of the Relationship Agreement is available on abnamro.com. The Relationship Agreement will terminate if and when NLFI (directly or indirectly) holds less than 10% of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's issued share capital. A limited number of clauses will not terminate under any circumstances.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement includes the following provisions, subject to certain conditions stated in the agreement:\n\n- H NLFI's right to be consulted by (a) the Supervisory Board on the appointment or reappointment of (i) members of the Executive Board and (ii) the Chairman of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board, and (b) the Executive Board on a proposal for the appointment of the external auditor;\n- H NLFI's right of prior approval of any issuance of (or granting of rights to acquire) shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO for as long as NLFI holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO;\n- H NLFI's right of prior approval of (a) for as long as NLFI holds more than 50% of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO: any investments or divestments by ABN/uni00A0AMRO or any of its subsidiaries with a value of more than 5% of the equity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0and (b)/uni00A0for as long as NLFI holds 50% or less/uni00A0but 33 1/3% or more/uni00A0of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO: any investment or divestments by ABN/uni00A0AMRO or any\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to\n\nleadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\n## General Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "of its subsidiaries with a value of more than 10% of the equity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO;\n\n- H NLFI's/uni00A0obligation to effect sell-downs of ABN/uni00A0AMRO shares through STAK AAB;\n- H Certain orderly market arrangements; and\n- H Certain information rights for NLFI as long as it holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\n## STAK AAB\n\nSTAK AAB is a trust office independent of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the holder of a majority of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's issued share capital. STAK AAB acquired such shares for the purpose of administration ( ten titel van beheer ) in exchange for depositary receipts. The manner in which this structure can serve as a defence measure and STAK AAB's role in this is set out in this section under Anti-takeover measures.\n\nIn addition to serving as a defence measure, STAK AAB aims to promote the exchange of information between ABN/uni00A0AMRO on the one hand and holders of depositary receipts and shareholders on the other hand. It also promotes the acquisition of voting instructions from depositary receipt/uni00A0holders, for example by organising a meeting of depositary receipt/uni00A0holders prior to ABN/uni00A0AMRO's General Meetings. STAK AAB reports on its activities at least once a year in its annual report. In addition, further sell-downs of NLFI's shareholding in ABN/uni00A0AMRO will take place through STAK AAB (and in the form of depositary receipts) only.\n\nBy virtue of its Trust Conditions, STAK AAB must ensure that, no later than two weeks before a General Meeting of ABN/uni00A0AMRO is held, a meeting of depositary receipt holders is held at which the agenda items of that General Meeting are discussed. Accordingly, STAK AAB held meetings of depositary receipt/uni00A0holders before the Annual and Extraordinary General Meetings of ABN/uni00A0AMRO on 6 April 2020 and 1/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 respectively.\n\nThe STAK AAB website (stakaab.org) provides more information on the activities of STAK AAB, as well as its annual report, articles of association (including STAK AAB's objectives), the Trust Conditions and any information relating/uni00A0to meetings of depositary receipt/uni00A0holders.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO and STAK AAB held one periodic meeting in 2020. The items discussed included the published financial results, the long-term strategy of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the intended governance in the event of hostile bids and shareholder activism.\n\n## Anti-takeover measures\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has implemented a structure whereby STAK AAB is the holder of shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's issued share capital and has issued depositary receipts representing such shares with the cooperation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. The purpose of having a structure under which depositary receipts are created and STAK AAB is the legal owner of/uni00A0the underlying shares is to create a defence measure.\n\nSTAK AAB will do everything in its power to deter any action that could affect the independence, continuity or identity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. In a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of depositary receipt/uni00A0holders. In a hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business enterprises. Under all circumstances, STAK AAB will also take into account the legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients, debt investors, shareholders, depositary receipt/uni00A0holders, employees, and the society in/uni00A0which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates.\n\nIn a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will grant a power of attorney to the depositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights attached to the underlying shares. STAK AAB will not exercise voting rights on the shares, unless holders of depositary receipts have requested it to do so. This may be different under hostile circumstances as described in Section 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code. In this case, STAK AAB may refuse or revoke powers of attorney for up to two years (whereby NLFI must pre-approve this decision by STAK AAB as long as NLFI holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO) and STAK AAB itself will exercise the voting rights. In doing so, it should, pursuant to the Trust Conditions and the articles of association of STAK AAB, focus primarily on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's interests, taking into account the legitimate interests of the stakeholders mentioned above.\n\n## Employee Council\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's employees are represented by works councils ( ondernemingsraden ) at all levels of its group in which specifically appointed delegates are centralised in the/uni00A0overarching Employee Council ( Raad van Medewerkers ). Under Dutch law, the managing board of any company running an enterprise in which a works council has been established must seek the non-binding advice of the works council before taking certain decisions with respect to the enterprise, such as those related to a major restructuring, a change of control, or the appointment or dismissal of a member of the managing board. Certain other decisions directly involving employment matters that apply either to all employees or certain groups of employees may only be taken with the works council's consent.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to\n\nleadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\n## General Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Employee Council and ABN/uni00A0AMRO have entered into an agreement under which the Employee Council has been granted certain additional rights (the Works Council Covenant). Under the Works Council Covenant, the Employee Council has the right of inquiry ( enqu\u00eaterecht ) within the meaning of Section 2:346 of the/uni00A0Dutch Civil Code in the event of a hostile situation. The/uni00A0Works Council Covenant defines the following situations as hostile: (i) a public offer has been announced or is made in respect of shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO (or in respect of depositary receipts representing such\n\nshares) or there is a justified expectation that this will take place, without agreement first having been reached between the bidder and ABN/uni00A0AMRO, (ii) the exercise of the voting rights by a depositary receipt holder or shareholder would effectively be in conflict with the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business, or (iii) any other situation in/uni00A0which the independence, continuity or identity of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the enterprises associated with ABN/uni00A0AMRO could be harmed. Other situations can be qualified as hostile in an agreement between the Employee Council and ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Furthermore, if NLFI requests the/uni00A0consent, cooperation and/or a position statement of ABN/uni00A0AMRO in the event of a subsequent placement or a private sale of shares or depositary receipts, the Employee Council will be requested by ABN/uni00A0AMRO to provide advice within the meaning of Articles 25 and 26 of the Works Councils Act ( Wet op de Ondernemingsraden ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\n## General Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Codes and regulations\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is required to comply with a wide variety of governance codes and regulations, including the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Banking Code and CRD V. This section explains how ABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with these codes and regulations. More comprehensive overviews of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's compliance with such codes and regulations are published under the Corporate Governance section on/uni00A0abnamro.com.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nWe believe that when corporate governance meets high international standards, it significantly boosts the confidence of a company's stakeholders. As depositary receipts for shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO are listed on Euronext Amsterdam, ABN/uni00A0AMRO adheres to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with all principles and best practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, except for the deviations and nuances described below.\n\nUnder the Corporate Governance section on its website, ABN/uni00A0AMRO also publishes a detailed comply or explain list with regard to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code that applied in 2020.\n\nBest practice provision 1.3.6 (Absence of an internal audit department) does not apply since there is a separate department for the internal audit function within ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies best practice provision 2.1.9 (Independence of the chairman of the supervisory board), which states that the chairman of the supervisory board should not be a former member of the management board of the company. Although Mr Tom de Swaan was a member of the managing board of the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO, the current ABN/uni00A0AMRO is the result of various legal and operational separations and combinations, a merger and a legal demerger that took place after the acquisition of the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Holding N.V. (the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group) by a consortium of banks in/uni00A0October/uni00A02007. The/uni00A0consortium consisted of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Fortis and Banco Santander S.A (the Consortium). In/uni00A0October/uni00A02008, when the Fortis group experienced financial difficulties, the Dutch State acquired certain operations of the Fortis group, as well as Fortis' interest in the vehicle that had acquired the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO group. ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group N.V. (ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group) was newly incorporated on 18/uni00A0December/uni00A02009 to hold the operations, assets and liabilities of parts of the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO group and the part of the Fortis group acquired by the Dutch State. On 6 February 2010, the new and\n\ncurrent ABN/uni00A0AMRO demerged from the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. into a newly incorporated entity. The former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. was subsequently renamed Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. On 1/uni00A0July/uni00A02010, the new ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. merged pursuant to a legal merger, following which the current ABN/uni00A0AMRO was the surviving entity and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. was the disappearing entity. ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group was merged into ABN/uni00A0AMRO on 29/uni00A0June/uni00A02019. The former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Group and ABN/uni00A0AMRO are different entities than the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Holding N.V. or former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies best practice provision 4.1.3 (Agenda), which states, among other things, that (a) each substantial change in the corporate governance structure of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO and in the compliance with the Code and (b)/uni00A0material changes in the Articles of Association should be presented to the General Meeting as a separate discussion item or voting item, as applicable. The only exception to this/uni00A0best practice provision is that the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board may decide to place certain topics on the agenda under one agenda item if these topics are justifiably related. ABN/uni00A0AMRO considers this to be a further/uni00A0substantiation of this best practice provision, which may be/uni00A0necessary when proposals to amend the Articles of/uni00A0Association or the corporate governance structure of ABN/uni00A0AMRO are interrelated in such a way that separate votes on each of these proposals could result in an imbalanced voting result and, in turn, an imbalance in the/uni00A0corporate governance structure.\n\nBest practice provision 4.3.3 (Cancelling the binding nature of a nomination or dismissal) is not applicable to ABN/uni00A0AMRO since it applies the rules applicable to a large company regime ( structuurregime ).\n\nBest practice provision 4.3.4 (Voting right on financing preference shares) is not applicable to ABN/uni00A0AMRO as ABN/uni00A0AMRO has not issued financing preference shares.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO does not apply principle 4.4 (Issuing depositary receipts for shares). In contradiction to this principle and provision, the issuing of depositary receipts by STAK AAB is primarily used as a defence measure and not to prevent shareholder absenteeism from enabling a minority of shareholders to control the decision-making process at a General Meeting. Regulatory considerations have been decisive in choosing a structure with depositary receipts as a protective measure. Declarations of No Objection are required in connection with the direct or indirect acquisition of a qualified holding in regulated entities in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO holds an interest.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\n## Codes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Therefore, this structure provides ABN/uni00A0AMRO with the greatest possible certainty of adequate protection against a hostile takeover. Although the issuing of depositary receipts has been set up primarily as a defence measure and not to prevent absenteeism, STAK AAB aims to promote the exchange of information between ABN/uni00A0AMRO on the one hand and holders of depositary receipts and shareholders on the other by, for example, organising a meeting of depositary receipt holders before every General Meeting. More information on the purpose and functioning of the depositary receipts and STAK AAB, including information on/uni00A0situations in which STAK AAB may decide to limit, refuse or revoke powers of attorney (and to not observe any voting instructions received), can be found on the STAK AAB website (stakaab.org).\n\nCompliance with best practice provisions 4.4.1 - 4.4.5 and 4.4.7 - 4.4.8 are a responsibility of the board of STAK AAB. With respect to best practice provisions 4.4.5 and 4.4.8, the following applies. In a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of depositary receipt holders. In a hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business enterprises. Under all circumstances STAK AAB will also take into account the legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients, savers and deposit holders, shareholders, depositary receipt holders, employees, and the society in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates. Furthermore, STAK AAB has in principle the obligation to grant a power of attorney to depositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights attached to the underlying shares and will not exercise voting rights on the shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO (unless depositary receipt holders have requested STAK AAB to do so). The foregoing could be different in the hostile situations described in article 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code. STAK AAB may then decide to (a) limit, exclude or revoke powers of attorney and (b) not observe voting instructions received for a period of up to two years. Furthermore, under the depositary receipt terms, when exercising the voting rights in a hostile situation, STAK AAB should focus primarily on the interests of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its business enterprises as set out above.\n\nPrinciple 5.1 and best practice provisions 5.1.1 - 5.1.5 are not applicable since ABN/uni00A0AMRO has a two-tier board.\n\n## Dutch Banking Code\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code sets out principles that banks with a corporate seat in the Netherlands (i.e. with a Dutch banking licence) should observe in terms of corporate governance, risk management, audit and remuneration. The/uni00A0Dutch Banking Code applies to ABN/uni00A0AMRO as the main entity within a group that holds a Dutch banking licence. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is therefore committed to complying with the Dutch Banking Code and devotes a great deal of effort to ensuring that the spirit of the code is reflected in the behaviour of its employees and the culture of the bank. As/uni00A0such, we are pleased to confirm that ABN/uni00A0AMRO complies with the principles of the Dutch Banking Code. A principle-by-principle overview of the manner in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO complied with the Dutch Banking Code during 2020 is published on abnamro.com.\n\nThroughout 2020, we continued to improve the manner in which we apply the principles of the Dutch Banking Code, taking into account the focus areas indicated by the Dutch Banking Code Monitoring Committee. In particular, the bank devoted a great deal of attention to leadership, integrity and its societal role, including increased efforts regarding sustainability and providing services to clients in their best interests, as also reflected in our strategy.\n\nDuring 2020, further improvements were made to the process of succession planning, permanent education and self-assessments performed at Board level. All members of the Supervisory Board and Executive Board of ABN/uni00A0AMRO have taken the Banker's Oath, as required by Dutch law. The oath is a confirmation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's existing policies, which are fully in line with the bank's cultural principles and core values. Along with the introduction of a Social Charter and the Banking Code, the Dutch banking industry has taken the initiative to have all employees take the Banker's Oath. Employees take the oath to affirm their commitment to upholding high standards of ethical behaviour. They are personally responsible for complying with these rules of conduct and may be held accountable for non-compliance.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\n## Codes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our purpose is clearly defined as 'Banking for better, for generations to come'./uni00A0We/uni00A0want to create value for society not only as a provider of financial services to our clients but also as an/uni00A0employer. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's remuneration principles apply to/uni00A0all of/uni00A0our employees and underscore our goal of nurturing a culture of engaged,/uni00A0well-trained and high performing people and processes. Since this remuneration report is also published separately, reference is made to other parts of the annual report for further context, such as/uni00A0strategy and financial performance.\n\n## Remuneration policy Remuneration in relation to corporate strategy and/uni00A0interests\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has embedded its long-term corporate strategy applicable during most of 2020, as well as its/uni00A0sustainability policies, in its remuneration policy and principles.

Since 2015, limitations with respect to remuneration and particularly variable remuneration have applied to all employees in the Dutch financial sector, with even more restrictions applying to financial institutions supported by the Dutch State by way of shareholdings. As long as the Dutch state holds an interest, ABN/uni00A0AMRO will apply a prohibition on bonuses and individual salary increases (together referred to as 'the Bonus Prohibition') for a specific group of senior/uni00A0employees./uni00A0\n\n## Responsible remuneration policy\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO pursues a responsible remuneration policy that remains within the regulatory boundaries,/uni00A0while/uni00A0taking into account/uni00A0the interests of stakeholders and best practices.

This means we are rethinking,/uni00A0innovating and pulling together to move forward with our purpose. To achieve that, we need well trained, engaged and entrepreneurial employees and\n\nflawless processes and technologies. We need to keep our current employees engaged and enable them to develop new skills by investing in employee development. We also need to be able to attract new talent to/uni00A0deliver and continue to/uni00A0create value for our stakeholders and society at large. We/uni00A0strive to embed new remuneration regulations effectively and efficiently in our reward policies and principles, while safeguarding our/uni00A0licence/uni00A0to operate, achieving our ambitions, and balancing our risks and opportunities./uni00A0\n\nOur remuneration principles are set out in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's Global/uni00A0Reward/uni00A0Policy,/uni00A0which is designed to support the/uni00A0bank's/uni00A0business/uni00A0and/uni00A0risk strategy,/uni00A0objectives,/uni00A0values and/uni00A0long-term interests. The Global Reward Policy principles apply at all levels and in all countries of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's international network (including branch offices). Our remuneration/uni00A0policy/uni00A0should enable us/uni00A0to attract and retain the right talent and ensure that we meet our responsibilities to clients and other/uni00A0stakeholders,/uni00A0both now and in the future. In addition, ABN/uni00A0AMRO's enhanced People Strategy includes building a stronger link between the performance and reward strategy and framework.\n\nThe Supervisory Board approves the general remuneration principles laid down in the Global Reward Policy and assesses/uni00A0the general principles and exceptions that relate to the applicable governance and/or/uni00A0international guidelines and regulations within the financial sector. The policy is reviewed regularly,/uni00A0considering/uni00A0the company's strategy and culture (and any changes in these), as well as factors such as risk awareness, targets and corporate values./uni00A0\n\nWe are well aware that the only way to successfully implement our strategy is to create conditions in which all our employees can use their talents to contribute to our goals and to develop or acquire the right skills. We strive to achieve a future-proof workforce, with an excellent employee experience and leadership that inspires, alongside efficient organisational structures, processes and IT systems that help our employees work more effectively. With its diversity and inclusion policy, ABN AMRO aims to be an organisation where people feel safe and welcome. Rewarding equal work equally is of fundamental importance and has ABN AMRO's full attention.\n\n## Performance management and KPI setting\n\nOur annual performance management cycle for Identified Staff aims to create links between performance (realistic, sustainable results) and reward in such a way that reward is aligned with both the employee's and the bank's performance. We use a set of balanced financial and non-financial/uni00A0KPIs, as well as qualitative and quantitative\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\nRemuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The peer group consisted of companies comparable to ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank/uni00A0in terms of market, size\n\nor/uni00A0profile. The results of the benchmark clearly indicate that,/uni00A0in respect of the annual fixed fee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO was positioned below or at the 25th percentile against the chosen peer groups./uni00A0In addition, we invited stakeholders to/uni00A0consultation meetings to enable the Chairman of our Remuneration Committee to hear feedback and explore ways of implementing our remuneration policy and to address areas of concern./uni00A0The remuneration policies were prepared with due observance of those valuable views received and mindful, among other things, of the highly regulated environment within which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates.\n\nWith regard to the Executive Board remuneration policy, we continued our remuneration policy as most recently adopted in 2015 and updated to comply with new legislation. Variable remuneration remained part of the remuneration package. Additional information on variable remuneration is included in the Executive Board remuneration policy since this is required by the new Shareholder Rights Directive, although variable and sharebased remuneration cannot be awarded by ABN/uni00A0AMRO while the Bonus Prohibition applies. With regard to the Supervisory Board remuneration policy, the changes are discussed below/uni00A0under Supervisory/uni00A0Board/uni00A0remuneration in 2020./uni00A0There were no deviations from the/uni00A0decision-making process for implementing the remuneration policies/uni00A0of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, and no deviations in/uni00A0the execution of these remuneration policies./uni00A0\n\nThe Annual General Meeting in 2020 was an important opportunity for all shareholders and depositary receipt holders to express their views. The remuneration policies for the Executive Board and Supervisory/uni00A0Board were adopted, with 99.56% and 99.51%, respectively, of the votes cast. These new remuneration policies apply as of 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020 for a period of four years. The Remuneration Committee may ask the general meeting to adopt an amendment at an/uni00A0earlier date if this is considered appropriate.\n\nAt the/uni00A0Annual General Meeting/uni00A0in 2020, the remuneration report for/uni00A0the/uni00A0financial year 2019 was put to an advisory vote, with 99.08% of the (non-binding)/uni00A0votes cast being in/uni00A0favour/uni00A0of a positive advice./uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0was pleased to note the positive/uni00A0advisory vote/uni00A0and/uni00A0feedback, and has built on it in shaping this year's remuneration report.\n\n## Changes expected in 2021\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's/uni00A0collective/uni00A0labour/uni00A0agreements apply until 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02022.

The CAO Banken provides for two collective salary increases of 2.5% each with effect from 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02019 and 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020, respectively./uni00A0\n\nThe three members of the Executive Board/uni00A0(excluding the Chairman)/uni00A0each earn the same salary, which for 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A0645,163 gross per annum. The difference between the salary of the Chairman of the Executive Board, Robert/uni00A0Swaak, and other members is 15%/uni00A0on an annual basis. His annual salary for 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A0759,978 gross./uni00A0\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nThe remuneration package for members of the Executive Board provides for a variable compensation component. However, the Bonus Prohibition does not allow payment of/uni00A0such  compensation to board members of financial institutions falling under the scope of the Financial Supervision Act during the period the Dutch State provides support through a shareholding in the institution. The members of the Executive Board are therefore not entitled to receive variable remuneration during the period/uni00A0of state ownership. As this continued to be the case in the 2020/uni00A0 performance/uni00A0year,/uni00A0Executive/uni00A0Board/uni00A0members did/uni00A0not/uni00A0receive any variable remuneration.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe Chairman and members of the Executive Board participate in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's pension schemes applicable to all employees in the Netherlands, whereby it should be noted that Clifford Abrahams is not a Dutch tax resident./uni00A0\n\nFor/uni00A0pensionable/uni00A0salary up/uni00A0to/uni00A0the/uni00A0applicable threshold, which for 2020/uni00A0amounted/uni00A0to/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0110,111, a collective defined contribution (CDC) pension scheme applies.

The current Executive Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmembers all have the same contractual right to a severance payment equal to three months' gross fixed salary. Based on the remuneration policy for Executive Board members, Kees van Dijkhuizen was awarded a severance payment equivalent to three months' gross fixed salary upon his departure in 2020.\n\n## Scenario analyses\n\nScenario/uni00A0analyses are the analyses conducted by the Supervisory Board when formulating the remuneration policy and before determining the remuneration of individual Executive Board members. They show the possible outcomes of the variable remuneration components and the way in which these affect the remuneration of the/uni00A0Executive Board members. The Supervisory Board establishes whether the scenario analyses result in appropriate levels of remuneration, and whether measures are required to limit the remuneration.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the total target remuneration of the Executive Board members is below the median in the relevant benchmarking population. With the choice for continuation of the previous remuneration policy with only some refinements to safeguard alignment with the new Shareholders Rights Directive and considering no variable remuneration is awarded/uni00A0and the remuneration restrictions that apply to ABN/uni00A0AMRO,/uni00A0the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that/uni00A0scenario analyses resulted/uni00A0in/uni00A0the/uni00A0appropriate levels of remuneration and that further scenario analyses are less relevant.\n\n## Contractual relationships and appointment periods\n\nAll current Executive Board members have been appointed for a maximum of four years, with the appointment ending at the close of the first Annual General Meeting held after the agreed term has passed since/uni00A0their/uni00A0appointment date, unless a shorter period is set at the time of appointment or reappointment, taking into account/uni00A0the rotation scheme.

The performance outcome is based on a set of financial and non-financial performance indicators, as well as on individual leadership, as set out in the table/uni00A0below and as also described above.

Within ABN/uni00A0AMRO, the group of Identified Staff consists of:/uni00A0\n\n- H Members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards;\n- H Members of the Executive Committee, not being a member of the Executive Board;\n- H Members who fulfil a position at above-CLA level;\n- H Staff responsible for independent control functions;\n- H Other risk takers. The definition of the group of other risk takers follows from their impact on the economic capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO (EC threshold), membership of certain\n\nrisk committees, having credit authority above a certain threshold and fulfilling specific roles;\n\n- H Other employees whose total remuneration puts them in/uni00A0the same remuneration bracket as senior managers and risk takers.\n\n## Composition of remuneration packages\n\nIn general, the remuneration packages for Identified Staff have been structured in accordance with regulations and restrictions applying to the financial sector. Different ranges apply to the various salary scales in each country, but we always position our remuneration levels around the median of the relevant labour market while keeping labour costs under control.

We also have in place specific rules for staff whose professional activities could have a material impact on the bank's risk profile; these individuals are referred to as Identified Staff. A typical remuneration package for Identified Staff consists of the following components:/uni00A0\n\n- H Annual base salary;\n- H Annual variable remuneration (with deferred payout in alignment with/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO's variable compensation plan);\n- H Benefits and other entitlements.\n\nABN AMRO strives to position the overall level of direct compensation for Executive Committee members and positions at above-CLA level just below the market median levels. In alignment with the Act on the Remuneration Policy for Financial Undertakings (Wbfo), which came into force in 2015, the variable compensation for this group of employees is capped at 20% of base salary for those employed in the Netherlands. In addition, and also with effect from 2015, all other remuneration restrictions, including the Bonus Prohibition, were extended to a specific group of/uni00A0senior employees as defined in the Wbfo. These senior employees, comprising, for example, Executive Committee members who are not also statutory directors, are therefore not allowed to be granted any variable remuneration until the Dutch State no longer holds an interest in ABN AMRO.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's collective/uni00A0labour/uni00A0agreement (CLA) governs the remuneration packages for Identified Staff based in the Netherlands unless they have been appointed to a position not governed by the/uni00A0CLA./uni00A0For Identified Staff based outside the Netherlands, ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0takes into account/uni00A0relevant business dynamics (e.g./uni00A0market conditions, local/uni00A0labour/uni00A0and tax legislation) when deciding on the composition of their reward packages. For/uni00A0the latter two categories of employees, the overall direct compensation/uni00A0is aimed to be positioned around the median levels in the relevant market. The maximum variable compensation percentage for employees working outside the Netherlands in another European Economic Area ('EEA') state is 100%; for employees working outside the EEA more than 100% is allowed, with a maximum of 200% and subject to shareholder approval. These percentages are in line with the international market environment in which we operate./uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO has not requested shareholder approval to increase the maximum variable compensation percentage to 200%, and hence applies 100% globally./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nPerformance/uni00A0for Identified Staff/uni00A0is measured over a oneyear performance period at three levels: group, business unit and individual level, and by means of risk-adjusted and partly risk-adjusted financial and non-financial performance indicators./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Performance indicators for Identified Staff\n\n|                                | Weighting   Executive  Board 5   | Weighting   Executive  Committee   | Weighting above  CLA identified staff   | Weighting CLA  identified staff   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Organisation level KPIs        | 30-65%                           | 20-30%                             | 10-20%                                  | 10%                               |\n| Businessline level KPIs        | 0-30%                            | 35-60%                             | 45-60%                                  | 15%                               |\n| Individual KPI 1               | 35%                              | 20-35%                             | 30-35%                                  | 75%                               |\n| Total                          | 100%                             | 100%                               | 100%                                    | 100%                              |\n| - of which financial  2, 4     | 20-30%                           | 20-40%                             | 15-30%                                  | 0-50%                             |\n| - of which non-financial  3, 4 | 70-80%                           | 60-80%                             | 70-85%                                  | 50-100%                           |\n\n- 1 Individual KPI: For employees above CLA the individual KPI refers to leadership.\n- 2 Financial KPIs include a selection of Return on equity, CET1 ratio, Cost/income ratio, Strategy value creation, Cost ceiling, Fee and commision income and RAROE.\n- 3 Non-financial KPIs include a selection of Sustainability, Employee engagement, Permanent education, NPS and House in order.\n- 4 Mix and weighting of KPIs tailored to specific function of the identified staff member.\n- 5 The CEO only has KPIs on individual and organisation level.\n\n## Variable remuneration for Identified Staff\n\nAll variable remuneration awards for Identified Staff are subject to and structured in accordance with ABN/uni00A0AMRO's/uni00A0Variable/uni00A0Compensation/uni00A0Plan. Before any variable remuneration is granted, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies an ex-ante risk assessment consisting of collective quantitative risk adjustment mechanisms (such as the/uni00A0solvency check) and/uni00A0a qualitative/uni00A0individual check (the gatekeeper). The gatekeeper procedure is part of the performance management framework and provides for an/uni00A0assessment\n\nof each individual Identified Staff member by the control\n\nfunctions (Risk, Compliance and Audit) on the basis of several behavioural elements. This assessment results in advice to the Executive Board, which ultimately decides on whether variable compensation can indeed be/uni00A0granted to the Identified Staff member concerned. The/uni00A0Executive Board's decision must be formally approved by the Supervisory Board, based on the advice of the Remuneration Committee. The variable remuneration is awarded over time and split between an up-front portion (60%) and a deferred portion (40%), with all portions divided equally between a cash and a non-cash instrument./uni00A0\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to leadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\n## Remuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Up-front variable remuneration is awarded in the first quarter of the year following the relevant performance year, while deferred variable remuneration vests in equal instalments in the years following the first payment. This remuneration vests only after an explicit ex-post risk assessment: the 'malus assessment'./uni00A0\n\nFor the award of variable remuneration for performance year 2020, two versions of the Variable Compensation Plan/uni00A0are applicable.\n\n## Awards until 29/uni00A0December/uni00A02020\n\nAwards of variable remuneration to identified Staff before 29/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 have taken place in accordance with the Variable Compensation plan as approved by the Supervisory Board on 14/uni00A0May/uni00A02019. Deferred variable remuneration in this plan vests in equal instalments in three years after the first payment.\n\nThe instrument underlying the non-cash award consists of an award in the form of a depositary receipt (DR) award, which is a conditional right to receive/uni00A0DRs./uni00A0One DR represents one share in ABN/uni00A0AMRO. The number of DRs to be awarded is calculated/uni00A0on the basis of/uni00A0the fair market value, which is equivalent to the average of the closing prices of the DRs as reported on the composite tape for securities at Euronext for the period of five trading days preceding the award date, which would normally be the first Thursday of March. The value therefore fluctuates in line with the market price of the DRs. A two-year retention period applies to the non-cash instruments. Any/uni00A0unconditional instrument will therefore need to be retained for a further two years.\n\n## Awards as of 29/uni00A0December/uni00A02020\n\nAwards of variable remuneration to Identified Staff as of 29/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 will take place, to the extent legally possible, in accordance with the Variable Compensation Plan as approved by the Supervisory Board in 2020. Deferred variable remuneration in this plan vests in equal instalments in four years after the first payment. The instrument underlying non-cash award consists of performance certificates. The value of the performance certificates depends on the share price of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and hence fluctuates in line with the market price of DRs. A one-year retention period applies to the non-cash instruments. Any unconditional instrument will therefore need to be retained for one more year.\n\nVariable remuneration awards with respect to the performance years up to and including 2015 will continue to/uni00A0use performance certificates, the value of which fluctuates in line with the net asset value of ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nThe last deferred payout of the value of performance certificates will take place in March/uni00A02021./uni00A0\n\n## Malus assessment 2020\n\nThe malus assessment is conducted by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board upon analysis and advice of the control functions (Risk, Compliance and Audit) and HR and Finance. Any outcome is subject to approval by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. The/uni00A0assessment includes determining whether any new information is available that prevents the vesting of/uni00A0deferred/uni00A0variable/uni00A0remuneration.\n\nThis could include:\n\n- H Evidence of misconduct or serious error by the staff member (e.g. breach of a code of conduct or other internal rules, especially concerning risks);\n- H The institution or the business unit subsequently suffers a significant downturn in its financial performance (specific indicators must be used);\n- H The institution or the business unit in which the Identified Staff member works suffers a significant failure of risk management;\n- H Significant changes in the institution's economic or regulatory capital base.\n\nThe Supervisory Board decided that, based on the reassessment performed by the control functions, there was no reason to apply a collective malus with respect to/uni00A0the vesting of:\n\n- H The first tranche of deferred variable compensation for/uni00A0the 2019 /uni00A0 performance period;\n- H The second tranche of deferred variable compensation for the 2018 /uni00A0 performance period;\n- H The third tranche of deferred variable compensation for/uni00A0the 2017 /uni00A0 performance period.\n\nFor performance period 2020, the Supervisory Board decided in two individual cases to apply a malus with respect to the vesting of any remaining deferred variable compensation for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 1 performance periods. Due to the Bonus Prohibition applicable to both staff members, the malus will have no financial impact. The other deferred variable compensation awards with respect to the above three performance periods will be granted to the relevant Identified Staff members in line with the terms and conditions of the Variable Compensation Plan.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has the discretionary power to reduce any variable compensation to a suitable amount/uni00A0if, in its opinion, payment of the compensation would be unacceptable under the principle of reasonableness and/uni00A0fairness. The Supervisory Board is also authorised to/uni00A0reclaim any variable remuneration for any performance\n\n- 1 In 2019 and 2020, the Supervisory Board decided to continue a malus with regard to the performance periods 2015 and 2016 for two individuals.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to\n\nleadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\n## Remuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reduction is also in line with regulatory guidance to this extent. For the 2020 performance period, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has decided not to award any performancerelated variable remuneration to its employees in the Netherlands or to employees abroad within the CIB business line. In addition, the performance-related variable remuneration for employees abroad in the Private Banking\n\nand Commercial Banking business lines has been reduced significantly. Consequently, the performance-related variable remuneration of all staff, including Identified Staff, decreased from EUR 65 million in 2019 to EUR/uni00A016/uni00A0million in 2020. In 2019, an amount of EUR 9 million was erroneously reported as relating to all staff instead of only to Identified Staff. For non-identified Staff, this was EUR 56 million in 2019. The total amount of retention payments increased from EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million in 2019 to EUR 14 million in 2020, mainly due to the retention payments paid in relation to the wind-down of all non-European CIB activities (except Clearing)./uni00A0\n\n|                                                                |       |       |       |       |       | Remuneration in/uni00A0millions 2   | Remuneration in/uni00A0millions 2   | Remuneration in/uni00A0millions 2   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| (in FTE) 1                                                     | 1-1.5 | 1.5-2 | 2-2.5 | 2.5-3 | 3-3.5 | 3.5-4                               | 4-4.5                               | >4.5                                |\n| Executive Board/Executive Committee                            | 1     |       |       |       |       |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Executive Committee -1 and -2 above CLA Other Identified Staff | 3     |       |       |       |       |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n\n- 1 Identified staff only.\n- 2 Remuneration reflects the amounts paid in the financial year as per EBA requirement, as opposed to the remuneration disclosure in the tables Remuneration of Executive Board and Supervisory Board which represents the remuneration allocated to the financial year in accordance with EU IFRS.\n\nThe ratio of the mean annual employee compensation and the total annual remuneration of the CEO was 10.2 in 2020. The ratio is equivalent to the CEO's remuneration, including pension costs, divided by the mean employee remuneration including pension costs during 2020. This ratio is considered to be a fair reflection of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's current position. The/uni00A0ratios published in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were 11.4, 10, 9.6 and 9.6 respectively.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nIntroduction to\n\nleadership/uni00A0&/uni00A0governance\n\nExecutive Board and Executive/uni00A0Committee\n\nSupervisory Board\n\nReport of the Supervisory Board\n\nGeneral Meeting and shareholder/uni00A0structure\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nLegal structure\n\n## Remuneration report\n\nResponsibility statement\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Non-cash activities were primarily impacted by additions to provisions and allowances. Further non-cash changes related to fair value reserves, cashflow hedges, foreign currency translation and interest accruals. Cashflows through operating activities grew mainly due to the participation in the TLTRO III programme, which was partly offset by the settlement of the TLTRO II progamme participation. Variance in investing activities was attributable to purchases and proceeds from sales and redemptions of financial investments. Proceeds of debt issuance resulted in a cashflow of EUR/uni00A028.2 billion, which was more than offset by debt repayments (EUR/uni00A036.2 billion). The issuance of an AT1 instrument resulted in a cash inflow of EUR/uni00A01.0 billion and was offset by the repayment of an AT1 instrument that resulted in a cash outflow of EUR/uni00A01.0 billion.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This section describes ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank's significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates or judgements relating to the Annual Financial Statements. If/uni00A0an/uni00A0accounting policy or a/uni00A0critical accounting estimate relates to a/uni00A0specific note, it is included within the/uni00A0relevant note.\n\n## Corporate information\n\nABN AMRO Bank N.V. (referred to as ABN AMRO Bank, ABN AMRO, the Bank or the parent company) and its consolidated entities provide financial services in the Netherlands and abroad (together referred to as the group). ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank is a public limited liability company, incorporated under Dutch law on 9 April/uni00A02009, and registered at Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Chamber of/uni00A0Commerce number 34334259).\n\n/uni00A0\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, all shares in the capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. are held by two foundations: NLFI and STAK AAB. NLFI holds 56.3% in ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V., of which 49.9% is held directly via ordinary shares and/uni00A06.4% is held indirectly via depositary receipts for shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. STAK AAB holds 50.1% of the shares in the issued capital of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. Both foundations have issued depositary receipts for shares in ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. Only STAK AAB's depositary receipts are issued with the cooperation of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. and traded on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\n/uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO provides a/uni00A0broad range of financial services to retail, private and corporate banking clients. These activities are conducted primarily in the Netherlands and selectively abroad.\n\n/uni00A0\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank for the annual period ended 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 incorporate financial information of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V., its controlled entities, interests in associates and joint ventures. The Annual Financial Statements were prepared by the Executive Board and authorised for issue by the Supervisory Board and Executive Board on 9/uni00A0March/uni00A02021.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). They also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, where applicable.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are prepared on a/uni00A0historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading or designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss, financial instruments not held in a 'hold to collect' business model, debt instruments that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test, and equity investments in associates/uni00A0or joint ventures for which the venture capital exemption is applied, all of which are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged items in fair value hedges, and otherwise carried at amortised cost, are adjusted to record changes in fair value attributable to the risks that are being hedged. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the/uni00A0equity method.\n\nManagement has considered the consequences of Covid-19 and other events and conditions, and it has determined that they do not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the bank's ability to continue as a going concern. The impact of Covid-19 on future performance and, therefore, on the measurement of assets, mainly loans and advances, is/uni00A0significant and therefore requires disclosure in the financial statements, but management has determined that these events and conditions do not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the entity's ability to continue as/uni00A0a going concern. Therefore, the Annual Financial Statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amendments provide practical relief for companies from certain requirements when changes are made to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships because of IBOR reforms, and provide additional disclosure requirements.\n\nWith effect from 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies the first set of amendments made to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 that address the pre-replacement phase or phase 1 issues introduced by the IBOR reform. The phase 1 amendments allow a company to apply temporary reliefs to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by the IBOR reform. Applying the relief prevents the disruption of hedging relationships as a result of uncertainty caused by the IBOR reform. The adoption of/uni00A0the amendments has not resulted in any impact on profit & loss or on the statement of financial position.\n\nIn/uni00A0August/uni00A02020, the IASB issued the second set of amendments to address the issues caused by the replacement phase of the IBOR reform. Amendments have been made to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16. The phase 2 amendments took effect on 1 January 2021, with early adoption permitted. ABN/uni00A0AMRO elected not to early adopt the phase 2 amendments in 2020. While ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates in global financial markets, the majority of its financial instruments are linked to the euro area key interest rate benchmarks EONIA and EURIBOR. EONIA will be replaced by \u20acSTR and will be discontinued on 3 January 2022. Since/uni00A0October/uni00A02019, EONIA has been calculated as \u20acSTR plus a fixed spread of 8.5 basis points. EURIBOR has been calculated using a hybrid methodology since 2019 and will not be reformed in the short-term. The/uni00A0IBOR reform in the euro area has not affected the basis of contractual cash flows or hedging relationships in 2020. Other key financial benchmarks are also being reformed, most notably the London InterBank Offered Rates (LIBOR) in the five LIBOR currencies: USD, GBP, EUR, JPY and CHF. LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021, with the exception of USD LIBOR which is expected to be phased out by mid 2023. Following the transition roadmap set out by the/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO bank-wide IBOR reform project, changes to contractual cash flows are scheduled to be made in the course of 2021. Early adoption of the phase 2 amendments is therefore not necessary.\n\n## IFRS 16 -/uni00A0Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions\n\nThe IASB issued the Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16 Leases. The amendment provides relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in/uni00A0lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under/uni00A0IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification. In/uni00A0October/uni00A02020, the EU endorsed the amendment to IFRS 16. The amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1/uni00A0June/uni00A02020, earlier application is permitted. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0lessee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has not obtained any lease concessions attributable to Covid-19. The amendments therefore do not/uni00A0have/uni00A0an impact on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 3 - Business Combinations\n\nIn/uni00A0October/uni00A02018, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations. These amendments, which resolve difficulties in determining whether an entity has acquired a business or a group of assets, are effective for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020. In/uni00A0October/uni00A02020, the EU endorsed the amendment to IFRS/uni00A03 to improve the definition of a business. From 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies the amended definition of a business for newly acquired business combinations. These amendments do not have an impact on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## IAS 1 and IAS 8 - Definition of Material\n\nIn/uni00A0October/uni00A02018, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The amendments, which became effective on 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020, revise the definition of material and align the definition across other IFRS publications such as IFRS Standards and IFRIC Interpretations. These amendments do not have an impact on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS\n\nIn/uni00A0March/uni00A02018, the IASB issued the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The Conceptual Framework provides guidance for developing consistent accounting policies and assistance in understanding the standards. The changes in the Conceptual Framework may affect the application of IFRS in situations where no standard applies to a particular transaction or event. The revised Conceptual Framework came into effect on 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020. These amendments do not have an impact on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet endorsed\n\nThe following new or revised standards and amendments have been issued by the IASB, but have not yet been endorsed by/uni00A0the EU. Only the amendments to IFRS that are relevant for ABN/uni00A0AMRO are discussed below.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 sets out requirements for the accounting, measurement and recognition of insurance contracts./uni00A0IFRS 17 is expected to be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023./uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO offers only limited insurance products. ABN/uni00A0AMRO has two equity accounted investments that have insurance products: Neuflize Vie and Captive NV. IFRS 17 may have a significant impact on these equity accounted investments, but ABN/uni00A0AMRO does not anticipate that the impact will be material to ABN/uni00A0AMRO's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nThe amendment to IAS 1 determining whether a liability should be classified as current or non-current has not yet been endorsed. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and is to be applied retrospectively. ABN/uni00A0AMRO does not expect that the amendments will have an impact on ABN/uni00A0AMRO's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying ABN/uni00A0AMRO's accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies for the most significant areas requiring management to make judgements and estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures are made in the following sections:\n\nImpairment losses on financial assets measured at AC\n\nRisk, funding & capital management section\n\nIncome tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities\n\nNote\n\n10\n\nImpairment of instruments measured at FVOCI\n\nNote\n\n16\n\nFair value of financial instruments\n\nNote\n\n18\n\nImpairment of ROU assets and goodwill\n\nNote\n\n23\n\nProvisions\n\nNote\n\n29\n\n## Assessment of risks, rewards and control\n\nWhenever ABN/uni00A0AMRO is required to assess risks, rewards and control, when considering the recognition and derecognition of assets or liabilities and the consolidation or deconsolidation of subsidiaries, it may sometimes be required to use judgement. Although management uses its best knowledge of current events and actions in making such assessments, the/uni00A0actual risks, rewards and control may ultimately differ.\n\n## Significant accounting policies Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. include the financial statements of the parent company and its controlled entities, thus incorporating the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. and its subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests (held by third parties) in both equity and results/uni00A0of/uni00A0group companies are presented separately in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Intercompany balances and transactions, and any related unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO's interest in the entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of/uni00A0impairment in the asset transferred.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Foreign currency balances of monetary items are translated into euros at the period-end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are recognised in the/uni00A0income statement.\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are stated in euros, which is the presentation and functional currency of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO. The bank's foreign operations may have different functional currencies. The functional currency is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying event and circumstances relevant to that entity. Prior to consolidation (or equity accounting), the assets and liabilities of non-euro operations are translated into euros at the closing rate, and items in the income statement and other comprehensive income are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction dates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in the currency translation reserve within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the bank loses control, joint control or/uni00A0significant influence over the foreign operation.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO classifies financial assets based on the business model in which they are held in accordance with IFRS 9. The business model is determined at a/uni00A0portfolio level. Portfolios are based on how ABN/uni00A0AMRO manages financial assets in order to achieve a/uni00A0particular business objective. The business model assessment is based on the level of sales, risk management, performance evaluation and management compensation. Derecognition is used as a/uni00A0condition to determine whether a/uni00A0transaction results in a/uni00A0sale.\n\n/uni00A0\n\n## Three business models are distinguished:\n\n- \u00c5 'Hold to collect' business model, in which cash flows are primarily generated by collecting contractual cash flows until maturity of the financial instrument. Sales can occur, as long as they are incidental, infrequent and insignificant. The/uni00A0assessment of the frequency and significance of sales is determined for each underlying portfolio. Sales that result from increases in the credit risk of the counterparty or take place close to maturity do not contradict the 'hold/uni00A0to collect' business model;\n- \u00c5 'Hold to collect and sell' business model, in which the selling of financial assets is integral to achieving the business objective. In this business model, sales take place more frequently and have a/uni00A0greater value than in a/uni00A0business model with/uni00A0an objective to hold to collect;\n- \u00c5 Other business models not meeting the criteria of the business models mentioned above, for example business models in which financial assets are managed with the objective of generating cash flows from/uni00A0sales (trading book), are measured at FVTPL.\n\nAfter the business model has been determined, the contractual cash flows of financial assets are assessed. Debt/uni00A0instruments can be classified at amortised cost or FVOCI only when the contractual cash flows are solely payments/uni00A0of/uni00A0principal and interest (SPPI). Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending arrangement in which consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant interest elements. Debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI requirements are mandatorily measured at FVTPL. Financial assets are assessed in their entirety, including any embedded derivatives that are not separated from the host contract.\n\n/uni00A0\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Based on the business model determined and the SPPI assessment, the following measurement categories are identified under IFRS 9:\n\n- \u00c5 Amortised cost - Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are debt instruments within a 'hold to collect' business model with fixed or determinable payments which meet the SPPI criteria. These instruments are initially measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are presented net of credit loss allowances in/uni00A0the/uni00A0statement of financial position;\n- \u00c5 FVTPL - Financial instruments measured at FVTPL include instruments held for trading, derivatives, equity instruments for which the FVOCI option has not been elected and instruments whose cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are directly recognised in the income statement;\n- \u00c5 FVOCI - Financial instruments measured at FVOCI are debt instruments which are held in a 'hold to collect and sell'/uni00A0business model and which meet the SPPI criteria. They are initially measured at fair value, with subsequent unrealised changes recognised in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments for which the fair value option is/uni00A0elected are also measured at FVOCI.\n\nReclassifications of financial assets are expected to be very infrequent and occur only when ABN/uni00A0AMRO changes its business model for a/uni00A0certain portfolio of financial assets.\n\nPlease refer to the Risk, funding & capital management section for our accounting policies on the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI.\n\n## Classification of assets and liabilities held for trading\n\nA financial asset or financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is:\n\n- \u00c5 Acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term;\n- \u00c5 Part of a/uni00A0portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of/uni00A0a/uni00A0recent/uni00A0actual pattern of short-term profit taking; or\n- \u00c5 A trading derivative (except for a/uni00A0derivative that is a/uni00A0designated and effective hedging instrument).\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value. Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for the following instruments:\n\n- \u00c5 Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00c5 Financial liabilities that ABN/uni00A0AMRO has irrevocably designated at initial recognition as/uni00A0held at fair value through profit or/uni00A0loss when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch are managed on the basis of their/uni00A0fair value or/uni00A0include terms that have derivative characteristics in their nature.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities designated at FVTPL are/uni00A0presented in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of such liabilities is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.\n\nFinancial liabilities are never reclassified after initial recognition.\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nTraded instruments are recognised on the trade date, which is defined as the date on which ABN/uni00A0AMRO commits to purchase or sell the underlying instrument. If the settlement terms are non-standard, the commitment is accounted for as a/uni00A0derivative between the trade and settlement dates. Loans and advances are recognised when they are acquired or funded by ABN/uni00A0AMRO and derecognised when settled. Issued debt is recognised when issued, and deposits are recognised when the cash is deposited with ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Other financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, are/uni00A0recognised when ABN/uni00A0AMRO becomes a/uni00A0party to the contractual provisions of the asset or liability.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Financial assets are derecognised when ABN/uni00A0AMRO loses control and the ability to obtain benefits from the contractual rights that comprise that asset. This occurs when the rights are realised or expire, or when substantially all risks and rewards are transferred. Financial assets are also derecognised if the bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, but control has passed to the transferee./uni00A0Financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, and a/uni00A0liability recognised for the proceeds of any related funding transaction, unless a/uni00A0fully proportional share of all or specifically identified cash flows are transferred to the lender without material delay and the lender's claim is limited to those cash flows, and substantially all the risks, rewards and control associated with the financial instruments have been transferred, in which case that proportion of the asset is derecognised.\n\nWhen the terms and conditions of a financial asset have been renegotiated or otherwise modified to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new financial asset, ABN/uni00A0AMRO derecognises the financial asset, with the difference recognised in the income statement, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised financial asset is classified as stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes. ABN AMRO assesses, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, whether such modifications are substantial. Generally, a 10% change in the net present value of the cash flows between the initial and new contract results in a derecognition./uni00A0With regard to substantial modifications, e.g. due to forbearance measures, the derecognition gains or losses are recognised in net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost and disclosed separately, if material.\n\nIf the modification of the financial asset does not result in derecognition, the gross carrying amount of the financial asset is/uni00A0recalculated, based on the net present value of the new contractual cash flows, and discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The effect is recognised and disclosed as a modification loss in the income statement. Credit/uni00A0related modification gains or losses (i.e. due to forbearance measures) are recognised in the income statement and presented under impairment charges on financial instruments. Non-credit related modification gains or losses are recognised in the income statement and presented under interest income calculated using the effective interest method.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An/uni00A0exchange of an existing financial liability for a/uni00A0new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms, qualitatively and quantitatively (a 10% difference in the present value of the cash flows), is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and recognition of a/uni00A0new financial liability. The difference between the/uni00A0former amortised cost and the consideration paid is recognised in the income statement. Any subsequent resale is/uni00A0treated as a/uni00A0new issuance.\n\n## Client clearing\n\nAs a/uni00A0general clearing member, ABN/uni00A0AMRO provides clearing and settlement services to its clients for, among other things, exchange-traded derivatives.\n\nIn its capacity as a/uni00A0clearing member, ABN/uni00A0AMRO guarantees the fulfilment of obligations towards central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) of clients' transactions. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is not liable to clients for the non-performance of the CCP. In/uni00A0the/uni00A0event of a/uni00A0client defaulting, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has the legal obligation to settle all the client's positions with the relevant CCPs, possibly at a/uni00A0loss. Possible losses arising from this guarantee might relate not only to a/uni00A0client's current positions, but also to future trades of the client. ABN/uni00A0AMRO receives and collects (cash) margins from clients, and remits these margins to/uni00A0the relevant CCP in whole or in part. Given the stringent margin requirements set by the CCPs, possible future outflows of/uni00A0resources for new clearing transactions are considered close to zero.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO does not reflect the exchange-traded derivatives cleared on behalf of clients in its financial statements. Under normal circumstances, the guarantee has no fair value and is not recognised in the financial statements. The loss recognition in the event of non-performance of a/uni00A0client will be in line with our contingent liabilities policy.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of calculating operating cash flows, gives details of the source of cash and cash equivalents which became available during the year and the application of these cash and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed into cash flows from operations, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities. Movements in loans and advances and interbank deposits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments, as well as investments in, and sales of, subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment of long-term funds are treated as financing activities. Cash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised in the income statement on a/uni00A0systematic basis over the periods that the related expenses, for which it is intended to compensate, are recognised. In the case of an income-related grant, the grant is/uni00A0deducted from the related expense\n\n## Levies and other regulatory charges\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO recognises a/uni00A0liability arising from levies and similar charges when it becomes legally enforceable (i.e./uni00A0when/uni00A0the/uni00A0obligating event arises).\n\n## 2 Segment reporting\n\n## Accounting policy for segment reporting\n\nThe segment reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The segments are reported in a/uni00A0manner consistent/uni00A0with internal reporting provided to the Executive Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance and has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker. All transactions between segments are eliminated as intersegment revenues and expenses in Group Functions./uni00A0Geographical data are presented according to/uni00A0the management view.\n\nSegment assets, liabilities, income and results are measured based on our accounting policies and include items directly attributable to a/uni00A0segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a/uni00A0reasonable basis./uni00A0Transactions between segments are/uni00A0conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nInterest income is reported as net interest income because management primarily relies on net interest income as a/uni00A0performance measure, not gross income and expense.\n\nThere was no revenue from transactions with a/uni00A0single external client or counterparty exceeding 10% of the bank's total revenue in 2020 or 2019.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, interest income on consumer loans declined as a result of lower appetite in the current economic situation. Income on residential mortgages declined, reflecting slightly lower margins (in a competitive market) and/uni00A0average volumes (mainly due to high mortgage redemptions).\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by EUR/uni00A062/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0303/uni00A0million in 2020, largely as a result of lower credit card usage (at ICS) due to Covid-19.\n\nThe share of result in equity accounted investments increased by EUR/uni00A017/uni00A0million, reflecting higher results from stakes in associates.\n\nPersonnel expenses were EUR/uni00A0408/uni00A0million in 2020 and remained broadly flat compared with 2019 as lower pension costs (new CLA) were offset by the upscaling of AML activities and, to a lesser extent, as a result of minor restructuring provisions.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined by EUR/uni00A073/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A0656/uni00A0million in 2020. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower provisioning for the AML remediation programme, partly offset by service costs for Stater.\n\nImpairment charges declined by EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A077/uni00A0million in 2020, reflecting a limited impact of Covid-19.\n\n## Commercial Banking\n\nNet interest income amounted to EUR/uni00A01,471/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A01,523/uni00A0million). The decline was mainly driven by ongoing pressure on deposit margins and, to a lesser extent, lower average corporate loan volumes (largely reflecting lower demand) and slightly lower margins./uni00A0\n\nNet fee and commission income remained flat at EUR/uni00A0256/uni00A0million in 2020, despite the impact of Covid-19, which particularly affected payment services ('pay per use'), factoring (volumes) and trade. This decline was fully offset by increased fixed pricing.\n\nPersonnel expenses came down by EUR/uni00A038/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A0243/uni00A0million in 2020, mainly due to the transfer of FTEs to/uni00A0Group Functions in order to centralise AML activities, as well as lower pension costs (new CLA).\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined by EUR/uni00A058/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0138/uni00A0million, largely due to provisioning in 2019 for/uni00A0the AML remediation programme (EUR/uni00A052/uni00A0million).\n\nImpairment charges increased to EUR/uni00A0542/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0182/uni00A0million), and largely included individual stage 3 impairments (mainly attributable to the sectors food, shipping, and industrial goods & services) and, to a lesser extent, management overlays in stage 1 and 2 to cover expected credit losses that were not captured by the models.\n\nIntersegment expenses increased by EUR/uni00A0117/uni00A0million due to the centralisation of AML activities in Group Functions.\n\n## Private Banking\n\nNet interest income amounted to EUR/uni00A0637/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0667/uni00A0million). Excluding the divestment of the Channel Islands in 2019, net interest income largely declined as a result of ongoing pressure on deposit margins and lower deposit volumes (as an effect of charging negative interest rates to an increased client base).\n\nNet fee and commission income came down slightly by EUR/uni00A07/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0502/uni00A0million in 2020, impacted by stock market developments, with a steep decline in Q2 followed by/uni00A0steep recovery in Q4./uni00A0\n\nOther operating income amounted to EUR/uni00A0282/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A034/uni00A0million), largely because 2020 included a EUR/uni00A0263/uni00A0million book gain on the sale of the Neuflize OBC office building in Paris.\n\nPersonnel expenses decreased by EUR/uni00A023/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A0371/uni00A0million in 2020, reflecting lower pension costs (new/uni00A0CLA) and the divestment of the Channel Islands in 2019.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decline was mainly driven by lower average corporate loan volumes (mostly CIB non-core wind-down) and, to a lesser extent, ongoing pressure on deposit margins./uni00A0\n\nNet fee and commission income improved by EUR/uni00A024/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A0529/uni00A0million in 2020, mainly as a result of higher market volatility (at Clearing), which was partly offset by the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\nNet trading income increased by EUR/uni00A090/uni00A0million, totalling EUR/uni00A0165/uni00A0million in 2020, largely reflecting a positive delta of EUR/uni00A049/uni00A0million for the provision for SME derivatives related issues (release in 2020, addition in 2019) and, to a lesser extent, more favourable CVA/DVA/FVA results in 2020.\n\nOther operating income amounted to EUR/uni00A0120/uni00A0million negative in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A055/uni00A0million). The decrease was largely attributable to negative fair market value adjustments on financial investments held at fair value through profit or loss in 2020 (as an effect of Covid-19), while 2019 included positive fair market value adjustments.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR/uni00A056/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A0484/uni00A0million in 2020, largely due to a provision for the CIB non-core wind-down (EUR/uni00A0103/uni00A0million), which was partly offset by the release for discretionary variable remuneration in 2020 (EUR/uni00A022/uni00A0million), and to a lesser extent, lower pension costs (new CLA).\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses remained broadly stable at EUR/uni00A0284/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0281/uni00A0million).\n\nImpairment charges were significant in 2020, totalling EUR/uni00A01,659/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A0376/uni00A0million) and largely included three exceptional client files and individual stage 3 impairments, mainly in the energy-services sector.\n\n## Group Functions\n\nNet interest income amounted to EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0million negative in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0147/uni00A0million). The decline was largely due to a EUR/uni00A080/uni00A0million one-off charge as a result of adjusted accounting estimates for amortisation of penalty interest on mortgages and, to a lesser extent, fewer other positive one-offs in 2020 (mainly DSB claim).\n\nNet fee and commission income declined by EUR/uni00A029/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A031/uni00A0million negative in 2020, largely due to lower income as an effect of the sale of Stater in Q2 2019.\n\nOther operating income amounted to EUR/uni00A078/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A0226/uni00A0million). The decrease was largely attributable to the EUR/uni00A0130/uni00A0million book gain for the sale of Stater in 2019.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR 40 million to EUR 774 million in 2020, mainly due to the upscaling of AML activities (largely transferred from Commercial Banking) and, to a lesser extent, wage inflation, partly offset by lower pension costs (new CLA) and the sale of Stater.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by EUR/uni00A044/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A01,412/uni00A0million in 2020, reflecting the upscaling of AML activities and additions to the provision for AML remediation programmes, while cost-savings programmes continued. /uni00A0\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The effective interest rate method allocates interest, amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences, including transaction costs and qualifying fees and commissions, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. The/uni00A0effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of/uni00A0the asset. As a result, this method requires ABN/uni00A0AMRO to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of client behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. Interest on loans and advances measured at fair value through profit or loss is also included in net interest income and recognised using the contractual interest rate. Interest income and expense on trading balances is included in/uni00A0net trading income. Interest paid on assets with a negative interest yield is classified as interest expense. Interest received from/uni00A0liabilities with a negative interest yield is classified as interest income.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                            | 2020      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income calculated using the effective interest method  | 7,525     | 9,701  |        |\n| Other interest and similar income                               | 290       | 355    |        |\n| Interest income                                                 | 7,815     |        | 10,056 |\n| Interest expense calculated using the effective interest method | 1,834     | 3,407  |        |\n| Other interest and similar expense Interest expense             | 118 1,952 | 181    | 3,588  |\n| Net interest income                                             | 5,863     |        | 6,468  |\n\n## Net interest income\n\nNet interest income decreased by EUR/uni00A0605/uni00A0million at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020.

The revised methodology is accounted for as a change in accounting estimates and recognised prospectively. This resulted in a decrease of EUR 80 million in interest income from loans and/uni00A0advances customers.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

The low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in interest expense on client deposits./uni00A0\n\n## 5 Net fee and commission income\n\n## Accounting policy for net fee and commission income\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies IFRS 15 when recognising revenue from contracts with clients, all of which is included in net fee/uni00A0and commission income. After identifying contracts and their performance obligations, revenue is recognised/uni00A0as an amount that reflects the consideration to which the bank expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised services to clients. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. Revenue is measured at the fair/uni00A0value of the consideration received, taking into account discounts and rebates. The amount of revenue recognised is/uni00A0discounted to the present value of/uni00A0consideration due, if payment extends beyond normal credit terms.\n\nRevenue is recognised when a promised service is transferred to the client. Fees and commissions are recognised either:\n\n- \u00c5 At a point in time: the fee is a reward for a service provided at a/uni00A0moment in time; or\n- \u00c5 Over time (amortised): the fee relates to services on an ongoing basis.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO engages in transactions where more than one party is involved in providing services to a client. In the case of/uni00A0these transactions, ABN/uni00A0AMRO assesses whether it is a principal or an agent in the transaction by evaluating the nature of/uni00A0its promise to the client.\n\n/uni00A0\n\nThe bank is a principal if it controls the promised goods or services before they are transferred to a client. The bank is acting as an agent, of another party, if it provides a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to a client and, as a result, does not control the specified goods or services./uni00A0Control of goods and services refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the goods and services.\n\n/uni00A0\n\nIf the bank is assessed to be a principal in the transaction, it recognises/uni00A0revenue/uni00A0in the gross amount of the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified goods or services transferred. If, however, the bank acts as an agent, it recognises/uni00A0revenue/uni00A0in the amount of the fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. The fee or commission may be the net amount of consideration that the bank retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for the goods or services to be provided by that party.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was slightly offset by lower payment service expenses due to a decline in/uni00A0volumes as a result of Covid-19.\n\n## 6 Net trading income\n\n## Accounting policy for net trading income\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, trading positions are held at fair value, and net trading income includes gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of such financial assets and liabilities. The lattercomprise gains and losses from trading financial assets and liabilities, interest income and expenses related to trading financial assets and liabilities, and dividends received from trading instruments. Dividend income and dividends from trading instruments are recognised at the dividend announcement date. Net trading income also includes changes in fair value arising from changes in counterparty credit spreads (CVA) and changes in own credit spreads (DVA) where these impact on the value of our trading assets and liabilities. The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and/uni00A0partly collateralised derivatives.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest instruments trading         |     68 |    -43 |\n| Equity and commodity trading         |     18 |     20 |\n| Foreign exchange transaction results |     77 |    107 |\n| Total net trading income             |    163 |     84 |\n\nNet trading income increased by EUR/uni00A079/uni00A0million in 2020. The overall trading result this year was higher than last year due to increased volumes and more volatile market conditions, especially in the first half of the year. In addition, an amount of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A018/uni00A0million was released from the provision SME derivatives-related issues.\n\nThe XVA was mainly impacted by the increase in the CVA and an opposing decrease in the FVA. The CVA increased due to/uni00A0changes in the exposure and the counterparty credit spreads. The FVA decreased due to lower funding spreads.\n\n## 7 Other operating income\n\n## Accounting policy for other operating income\n\nOther operating income includes all other banking activities such as operating lease activities as lessor and results on the disposal of assets. It also includes the change in fair value of derivatives used for risk management purposes that do not meet the/uni00A0requirements for hedge accounting, ineffectiveness of hedging programmes, fair value changes relating to assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in the value of derivatives related to such instruments. Dividend income from non-trading equity investments is recognised when entitlement is established. Income from operating lease activities is measured net of depreciation of the related assets.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

The movement is further explained by derecognition losses of EUR/uni00A012/uni00A0million (2019: gain of EUR/uni00A064/uni00A0million). The result from financial transactions in risk-mitigating derivatives increased by EUR/uni00A043/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0million negative in 2020, while the result from foreign exchange differences decreased by EUR/uni00A027/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A023/uni00A0million.\n\nThe decrease in disposal of operating activities is mainly due to the sale of a majority stake in Stater N.V. in 2019. Other/uni00A0income - Other increased as a result of a property sale in Paris, France.\n\n## 8 Personnel expenses\n\n## Accounting policy for personnel expenses\n\nSalaries and wages, social security charges and other salary-related costs are recognised over the period in which the/uni00A0employees provide the services to which the payments relate. The accounting policies for pensions and other post-employment benefits are included in Note 30 Pension and other employee benefits.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                               | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Salaries and wages                                 | 1,540  | 1,529  |\n| Social security charges                            | 216    | 238    |\n| Pension expenses relating to defined benefit plans | 1      | -1     |\n| Defined contribution plan expenses                 | 306    | 372    |\n| Other                                              | 217    | 109    |\n| Total personnel expenses                           | 2,280  | 2,247  |\n\nTotal personnel expenses increased by EUR/uni00A032/uni00A0million to EUR/uni00A02,280/uni00A0million in 2020 (2019: EUR/uni00A02,247/uni00A0million).\n\nThe increase in salaries and wages of EUR 11 million was mainly driven by an increase in FTE levels following the AML remediation programmes and a 2.75% increase in salaries under the Collective Labour Agreement. This increase was partly offset by the sale of the majority stake in Stater N.V. in 2019, combined with a decrease in the discretionary bonuses at CIB.\n\nSocial security charges decreased by EUR/uni00A023/uni00A0million, mainly due to a change in Dutch unemployment benefit. In 2020, the/uni00A0previous schemes (Sectorfonds and WW) were replaced by a general unemployment fund.\n\nPension expenses relating to defined benefit plans increased by EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million due to a one-time reversal of expenses in 2019 at ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. Oslo Branch to convert the pension scheme from a defined benefit to a defined contribution scheme. This was partly offset by a correction on pension expenses at Banque Neuflize OBC. /uni00A0\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A066/uni00A0million/uni00A0in defined contribution plan expenses was due to a new pension plan, as provided for in the/uni00A0Collective Labour Agreement, and a one-off payment of EUR/uni00A030/uni00A0million to the pension fund in 2019./uni00A0\n\nOther personnel expenses increased by EUR 108 million due to higher restructuring provisions in 2020 as a result of the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio. This was partly offset by the addition of a restructuring provision of/uni00A0EUR 12 million related to the integration of Private Banking Belgium in 2019.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

Income tax is recognised in the income statement and in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period in which profits arise. Withholding taxes are included in income tax/uni00A0when these taxes become payable by a subsidiary, associate or joint arrangement on distributions to ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Income tax recoverable on tax-allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as/uni00A0recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period. Current tax is measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for qualifying temporary differences. Temporary differences represent the difference between the/uni00A0carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of/uni00A0assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is both a legal right to offset and an intention to settle on/uni00A0a/uni00A0net/uni00A0basis.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                                                    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Recognised in income statement:                                                                         |        |        |\n| Current tax expenses for the current period                                                             | 417    | 674    |\n| Adjustments recognised in the period for current tax of prior periods                                   | -68    | -12    |\n| Total current tax expense                                                                               | 349    | 662    |\n| Deferred tax arising from the current period                                                            | -100   | -24    |\n| Impact of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes                                                        | -12    | -2     |\n| Deferred tax arising from the write-down or reversal of a write-down of a deferred tax asset            | 139    | 10     |\n| Deferred tax prior period                                                                               | 27     | -6     |\n| Previously unrecognised tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences reducing deferred tax expense |        | -9     |\n| Tax expense (income) relating to changes in accounting policies and errors included in profit and loss  | -1     | 3      |\n| Total deferred tax expense                                                                              | 52     | -28    |\n| Total income tax expense                                                                                | 401    | 634    |\n\nThe EUR 139 million write-down includes the write-down of deferred tax assets related to the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\n## Reconciliation of the total tax charge\n\nThe effective rate based on the consolidated income statement differs from the theoretical rate that would arise using the statutory tax rate of the Netherlands.

        "page_content": "The effective tax rate in 2020 (112.6%) is significantly higher than in 2019 (23.7%)./uni00A0This increase is mainly the result of an unfavourable geographical mix of pre-tax income and pre-tax losses. Furthermore, no full tax benefit was recognised on the provision for the CIB non-core wind-down, since no deferred tax asset could be recognised on the losses in specific tax jurisdictions. The residual deferred tax assets were written off in Q3 2020 to the level that ABN/uni00A0AMRO expects to recover in future years. The new Dutch rules on liquidation losses prevent ABN/uni00A0AMRO from applying stranded losses generated outside the EU against Dutch income.\n\nAdjustment previous years includes the 2019 portion of the tax benefit for AT1 coupon payments paid in 2019 and 2020, as well as a beneficial rate impact on the carry-back of US tax losses to periods prior to 1 January 2018. The 2020 portion of the deduction for AT1 coupon payments is included in non-deductible expenses and is offset by the impact of the new Dutch thincap rules for banks and several smaller permanent differences. Tax-exempt results were significantly lower in 2020, mainly due to the gains on the sale of Stater N.V. and the sale of the participation in equensWorldline S.E. in 2019.\n\n## Tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe most significant temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts, allowances for loan impairment and investments.

Recognition is based on estimates of sufficient taxable income by jurisdiction in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required and these could impact on our financial position and net profit. No deferred income taxes have been recognised on undistributed earnings of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's subsidiaries, branches and interests in joint ventures.\n\n## Tax losses\n\nThe total accumulated losses available for carry-forward at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 amounted to EUR/uni00A02,058/uni00A0million (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A01,416/uni00A0million), of which EUR/uni00A0101/uni00A0million (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A0141/uni00A0million) is recognised for future tax benefits. The recorded deferred tax asset for tax losses carried forward amounted to EUR/uni00A025/uni00A0million (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A031/uni00A0million).\n\n## Unrecognised tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets of EUR/uni00A0126/uni00A0million (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A051/uni00A0million) have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of EUR/uni00A0513/uni00A0million (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A0171/uni00A0million) and EUR/uni00A0349/uni00A0million\n\n- (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A0206/uni00A0million) has not been recognised in respect of gross tax losses of EUR/uni00A01,957/uni00A0million\n- (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A01,275/uni00A0million). This is because future taxable profits are not considered probable.\n\n## Tax credits and unrecognised tax credits\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO did not have any carry-forward tax credits at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020.\n\nThe following table shows when the operating losses as at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 expire.\n\nAfter 5\n\nNo\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | years   | expiration   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------------|---------|\n| 2020                                   |        |        |        |        |        |        |         |              |         |\n| Loss carry-forward recognised          |        |        |        |        | 1      | 1      | 2       | 97           | 101     |\n| Loss carry-forward not recognised      |        | 4      | 6      | 2      | 3      | 36     | 1       | 1,906        | 1,957   |\n| Total tax losses carry-forward (gross) |        | 4      | 6      | 2      | 4      | 37     | 2       | 2,003        | 2,058   |\n| 2019                                   |        |        |        |        |        |        |         |              |         |\n| Loss carry-forward recognised          |        |        | 7      | 2      | 4      |        | 3       | 125          | 141     |\n| Loss carry-forward not recognised      | 6      | 7      |        | 5      |        |        | 3       | 1,252        | 1,275   |\n| Total tax losses carry-forward (gross) | 6      | 7      | 7      | 8      | 4      |        | 6       | 1,377        | 1,416   |\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

Derivatives held for/uni00A0trading are closely related to facilitating the needs of our clients. A significant part of the derivatives in the trading portfolio is related to serving clients in their risk management to hedge, for example, currency or interest rate exposures. ABN/uni00A0AMRO also offers products that are traded on the financial markets to institutional and individual clients and governments.\n\nDerivatives held for risk management purposes include derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting and those used for/uni00A0economic hedges. A hedging instrument, for hedge accounting purposes, is a designated derivative whose fair value/uni00A0or/uni00A0cash flows are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of a designated hedged item.\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities subject to master netting arrangements are presented net only when they satisfy the/uni00A0eligibility requirements for netting under IAS 32. ABN/uni00A0AMRO did not have any netted derivative positions in/uni00A0the/uni00A0statement of financial position in either 2020 or 2019.\n\nAs derivative transactions and the related cash collateral held at a CCP are settled on a daily basis, the carrying amount of/uni00A0these positions in the statement of financial position is nil.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, the gross amount of trading assets must be associated with the gross amount of trading liabilities, which are presented separately in the statement of financial position.\n\n|                        |                              |

interest rate derivatives held for trading was mainly due to an increase in volume and number of trades.\n\nThe notional amount of currency derivatives held for trading decreased by EUR/uni00A017.4 billion, mainly due to lower client activity.\n\nThe increase in the notional amount of interest rate derivatives used for hedge accounting was EUR/uni00A010.4 billion. The portfolio of interest rate swaps increased as a result of interest rate risk management activities.\n\nThe hedging strategies are explained in greater detail in Note 15 Hedge accounting       .\n\n## 15  Hedge accounting\n\n## Accounting policy for hedge accounting/uni00A0\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO enters into various derivative and non-derivative instrument transactions with external parties to hedge risks on assets, liabilities and net investments. The accounting treatment of the hedged item and the hedging instrument depends on/uni00A0whether the hedge relationship qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nQualifying hedges may be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments. A non-derivative financial asset or liability may be designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes only if it hedges the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The hedged item can be an asset, liability, or net investment in a foreign operation that (a) exposes the entity to the risk of changes in fair value or future cash flows, and (b) is designated as being hedged.\n\nThe hedged risks are typically changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's market risk management strategy, which includes interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in the banking book, is described in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital management section.\n\nBoth at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, ABN/uni00A0AMRO assesses whether the derivatives designated in each hedging relationship are expected to be and have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. These prospective and retrospective effectiveness tests are performed by using a regression analysis. ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies the following criteria to assess whether the hedging relationship is effective:\n\n- \u00c5 A regression co-efficient (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression; and\n- \u00c5 A slope of the regression line is within a range of 0.80-1.25.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on components of a derivative that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded directly in the result from financial transactions as part of other operating income. ABN/uni00A0AMRO discontinues hedge accounting when the hedge relationship has ceased to be effective or is no longer expected to be effective, or when the derivative or hedged item is sold or otherwise terminated.\n\n## Application of IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Union\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.21,/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO has elected to continue applying the requirements of IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Union instead of applying the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. The EU-endorsed version of IAS 39 provides relief from certain hedge accounting requirements when compared to the full hedge accounting text of IAS 39. One of these reliefs is that negative credit spreads can be excluded from hedge relationships. ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies this to several micro fair value hedge relationships. Another relief is that the impact of changes in the estimates of the repricing dates is considered ineffective only if it leads to over-hedging. This relief is applied in the macro fair value hedge.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies fair value hedge accounting on individual hedged items (micro fair value hedging), as well as on a portfolio of hedged items (macro fair value hedging). Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item, the hedged item is adjusted in relation to the risk being hedged. Gains or losses on remeasurement of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognised in the income statement as result from/uni00A0financial transactions, which is part of the line item Other operating income.\n\nHedge effectiveness for fair value hedges is measured as the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are different from the changes in the fair value of the hedged item. When a fair value hedge of interest rate risk is terminated, any value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to profit or loss over the original designated hedging period, or taken directly to income if the hedged item is derecognised.\n\n## Micro fair value hedge accounting\n\nHedging instruments designated in individual fair value hedge relationships principally consist of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and cross-currency interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate liabilities due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness in micro fair value hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The effect of the counterparty and the bank's own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that is/uni00A0not/uni00A0reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate;\n- \u00c5 The difference in discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; and\n- \u00c5 Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.\n\n## Macro fair value hedge accounting\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO manages the interest rate risk arising from fixed-rate mortgages by entering into interest rate swaps. The exposure from this portfolio frequently changes due to new loans originated, contractual repayments and prepayments made by clients in each period. More than one group (or portfolio) of mortgages can be identified as the hedged item within the fixed-rate mortgage portfolio. To ensure an effective matching of hedged items and hedging instruments, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies a dynamic strategy in which hedged items are de-designated and re-designated on a monthly basis. The hedge accounting relationship is reviewed and re-designated on a monthly basis.\n\nHedged mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages with the following features:\n\n- \u00c5 denominated in local currency (euros);\n- \u00c5 fixed term to maturity or repricing;\n- \u00c5 pre-payable amortising or fixed principal amounts;\n- \u00c5 fixed interest payment dates;\n- \u00c5 no interest rate options;\n- \u00c5 accounted for on an amortised cost basis.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "At each designation, the mortgage cash flows are allocated to monthly time buckets, based on the expected maturity dates. ABN/uni00A0AMRO models the maturity dates of mortgages, taking into account the modelled prepayments applied to the contractual cash flows and the maturity dates of the mortgage portfolio. If the interest rate swap notional exceeds the expected mortgage notional in any given month, taking into account the uncertainty of the expected mortgage notional by applying a haircut, mortgages that mature in adjacent buckets are designated to the interest rate swaps.\n\nChanges in the fair value of the mortgages that are attributable to the hedged interest rate risk are recognised as fair value adjustments from hedge accounting in the income statement and adjust the carrying amount of the mortgages. The recognised fair value changes in the mortgages partially offset the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps and therefore reduce the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.\n\nAt the start of the hedge relationships and at each monthly de-designation, the difference between the fair value attributable to the hedged interest rate risk and the carrying amount of the hedged mortgages is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item.\n\nIn addition to the sources of ineffectiveness described for micro fair value hedges, the sources of ineffectiveness specifically for macro hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The difference between the expected and actual volume of prepayments for the mortgage portfolio to the extent the/uni00A0difference would lead to over-hedging; and\n- \u00c5 The difference in payment frequency between the fixed leg of the hedging instrument and the payment frequency of/uni00A0the hedged item (mortgages).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies cash flow hedge accounting to a portfolio of future cash flows on banking book assets and liabilities the hedged items - and a portfolio of interest rate swaps - the hedging instruments. The hedge relationship is reviewed on a/uni00A0monthly basis and the hedging instruments and hedged items are de-designated or re-designated, if necessary, to maintain an effective hedge accounting relationship.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to variability in the cash flows from a hedged item, the effective part of any gain or loss on remeasurement of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness for the macro cash flow hedge is measured as the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the/uni00A0interest rate swaps are in excess of changes in the fair value of the expected cash flows in the hedge relationship. Any ineffective part of the cash flow hedge is recognised in other operating income immediately. When a cash flow hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses continue to be recognised in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\nThe gains or losses are included in the same line item as the hedged transaction. In the exceptional case that the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The effect of the counterparty and the bank's own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that/uni00A0is not/uni00A0reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate; and\n- \u00c5 Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.\n\nThe hedged items in the macro cash flow hedge are future cash flows, which are derived from the projected balance sheet. This projected balance sheet takes the contractual terms and conditions of financial assets and liabilities and combines these with estimated prepayments, volume growth rates and interest scenarios.\n\nWithin the projected balance sheet, assets and liabilities are grouped on the basis of the specific interest rate index on which they reprice (e.g. one month, three months, six months, twelve months). For each repricing index, all assets and liabilities are allocated on a gross basis to monthly buckets in which they reprice up until their maturity.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The notional amounts of the interest rate swaps, which can be either pay or receive floating interest, are also grouped per interest rate index and allocated to monthly repricing buckets until their maturity. The hedge relationship is established by designating the interest rate swap cash flows per bucket to the corresponding bucket of projected cash flows of the hedged items. The hedged risk identified is the benchmark rate that applies to the buckets. If there are no projected cash flows available in the corresponding bucket for the applicable benchmark rate, the interest rate swap cash flows are designated to/uni00A0projected cash flows in a bucket with a different benchmark. The availability of projected cash flows in the buckets is not constant over time and is therefore evaluated on a monthly basis. Changes in cash flow projections may lead to a revision of/uni00A0the designation. Back-testing is performed on the interest rate risk models. Historical data are used to review the assumptions applied.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO may enter into foreign currency derivatives and currency borrowings to hedge various net investments in foreign operations. For such hedges, currency translation differences arising on translation of the currency of these instruments to euros are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve in other comprehensive income, insofar as they are effective. The accumulated gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement on the disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nIn previous years, ABN/uni00A0AMRO hedged its currency exposure to certain investments in foreign operations by hedging its net investment in these foreign operations with forward contracts. ABN/uni00A0AMRO currently still holds some currency translation reserve for these respective positions, but no longer applies net investment hedge accounting.\n\n## Hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe fair value changes of derivative transactions used to hedge against economic risk exposures that do not qualify for hedge/uni00A0accounting, or for which it is not cost-beneficial to apply hedge accounting, are recognised directly in profit or loss.\n\n## Effect on financial position and performance -

        "page_content": "## IBOR  benchmark  reform\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has analysed its significant hedging relationships directly affected by the benchmark reform. Most of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's financial instruments are linked to euro area benchmarks and, as a result, so are its hedging relationships. Neither EONIA, which is published alongside its replacement \u20acSTR, nor EURIBOR cause uncertainties to arise with respect to hedged risk and/or the timing and amount of cash flows in hedging relationships. In the case of EONIA, this is both because its replacement is already known and because ABN/uni00A0AMRO has not designated EONIA in any of its hedging relationships. In the case of EURIBOR, this is because it has already been revised in order to be BMR-compliant and no reform is anticipated in the short term. As a consequence, ABN/uni00A0AMRO's hedging relationships affected by the IBOR reform comprise only a small percentage of its total hedging relationships.\n\nA total of EUR/uni00A0138.8 billion of notional derivatives were part of hedging relationships at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, of which\n\nEUR/uni00A0123.0 billion was linked to EURIBOR and EUR/uni00A015.8 billion to other benchmarks. Of the derivative contracts linked to a non-EURIBOR benchmark, a notional amount of EUR/uni00A09.4 billion will mature before the cessation of the reference benchmark. These contracts are therefore not affected by the IBOR reform. A remaining total of EUR/uni00A06.4 billion notional is exposed to benchmarks under reform. A notional amount of EUR/uni00A04.2 billion is exposed to USD, EUR/uni00A01.4 billion to GBP, EUR/uni00A00.7 billion to/uni00A0CHF and EUR/uni00A00.1 billion to other benchmarks.\n\n## 16  Financial investments\n\n## Accounting policy for financial investments\n\nFinancial investments include financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n## Accounting policy for financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUnrealised gains and losses on FVOCI assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Interest earned, premiums, discounts and qualifying transaction costs of interest-earning FVOCI assets are amortised to income on an effective interest rate basis. When FVOCI debt instruments are sold, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in/uni00A0other comprehensive income is transferred to other operating income in the income statement. The impairment loss resulting from the ECL on FVOCI debt instruments is recognised in the impairment charges on financial instruments in the/uni00A0income statement. The related loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the/uni00A0carrying amount/uni00A0of the FVOCI debt instruments. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's impairment assessment and measurement approach for/uni00A0FVOCI debt instruments is set out in the Risk, funding & capital management section. Fair value changes in equity instruments that are/uni00A0irrevocably designated as FVOCI upon initial recognition are recognised in other comprehensive income and not subsequently reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Accounting policy for financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial investments can be designated at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (an accounting mismatch). ABN/uni00A0AMRO also has financial instruments that are mandatorily measured at fair value because they do not meet the/uni00A0SPPI test.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                  | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Financial investments                                                 |                                  |                                  |\n| Debt securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 46,600                           | 44,437                           |\n| Held at fair value through profit or loss                             | 855                              | 840                              |\n| Total financial investments                                           | 47,455                           | 45,277                           |\n\nThe increase of EUR/uni00A02.2 billion/uni00A0in financial investments was mainly due to an increase in German government bonds held and is reflected in the line item Debt securities.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Securities financing consists of securities borrowing and lending and sale/uni00A0and repurchase transactions. Securities borrowing and securities lending transactions are generally entered into on a collateralised basis, with securities usually advanced or received as collateral. The transfer of the securities themselves is not/uni00A0reflected in the statement of financial position unless the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred. If cash is/uni00A0advanced or received, securities borrowing and lending activities are recorded at the amount of cash advanced (included in/uni00A0loans and advances) or received (due to banks or customers). The market value of the securities borrowed or lent is monitored on a daily basis, and the collateral levels are adjusted in accordance with the underlying transactions. Fees and interest received or paid are recognised on an effective interest rate basis and recorded as interest income or interest expense.\n\nSale and repurchase transactions involve purchases (or sales) of investments with agreements to resell (or repurchase) substantially identical investments at a certain date in the future at a fixed price. Investments purchased subject to commitments to resell them at future dates are not recognised. The amounts paid are recognised in loans and advances to/uni00A0either banks or customers and are shown as collateralised by the underlying security.\n\nInvestments sold under repurchase agreements continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position. Proceeds from the sale of the investments are reported as liabilities to either banks or customers. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is recognised over the period of the transaction and recorded as interest income or interest expense, using the effective interest rate method. If borrowed securities are sold to third parties, the proceeds from the sale and a liability for the obligation to return the collateral are recorded at fair value.\n\n|                                   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)              | Banks                            | Customers                        | Total                            | Banks                            | Customers                        | Total                            |\n| Assets                            |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements     | 3,209                            | 7,801                            | 11,010                           | 2,713                            | 7,736                            | 10,449                           |\n| Securities borrowing transactions | 3,266                            | 2,448                            | 5,715                            | 1,628                            | 2,828                            | 4,456                            |\n| Total                             | 6,475                            | 10,249                           | 16,725                           | 4,341                            | 10,564                           | 14,905                           |\n| Liabilities                       |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Repurchase agreements             | 222                              | 9,264                            | 9,486                            | 91                               | 6,277                            | 6,368                            |\n| Securities lending transactions   | 398                              | 1,479                            | 1,877                            | 581                              | 1,285                            | 1,866                            |\n| Total                             | 620                              | 10,743                           | 11,363                           | 672                              | 7,562                            | 8,234                            |\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Items of securities financing transactions that/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO can repledge or resell are included in Note 33 Transferred, pledged, encumbered and restricted assets.\n\n## 18  Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\n## Accounting policy for fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value is defined as the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability in/uni00A0an/uni00A0orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nFor financial instruments that are actively traded and for which quoted market prices or market parameters are readily available, the fair value is determined in a highly objective manner. However, when observable market prices and parameters do not exist, management judgement is necessary to estimate fair value.\n\nFor financial instruments where no active liquid market exists, or quoted prices are unobtainable, recent market transactions are used or the fair value is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques - including reference to similar instruments for/uni00A0which market prices do exist, or to valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models (e.g./uni00A0Black Scholes).\n\nWhen portfolios of financial assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, any existing arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty) are taken into account.\n\nUnobservable inputs are estimated using a combination of management judgement, historical data, market practice and benchmarking to other relevant observable market data. The difference between the transaction price and the internal valuation at inception, calculated using a model, is reserved and amortised to profit or loss at appropriate points over the life of the instrument, typically taking account of the ability to obtain reliable external data, the passage of time and the use of offsetting transactions. Where inputs to the valuation of a new transaction cannot be reliably determined, the transaction is initially recognised at its transaction price. Subsequent changes in fair value as calculated by the valuation model are reported as profit or loss or in equity.\n\nIn order to determine a reliable fair value, where appropriate, management applies valuation adjustments to the pricing information derived from the above sources. These adjustments reflect management's assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, to the extent that these factors have not already been included in the information from the above sources. The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are as follows:\n\n- \u00c5 Credit and debit valuation adjustments. In addition to credit valuation for loans measured at fair value through profit or loss, credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the/uni00A0impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and how counterparties consider ABN/uni00A0AMRO's creditworthiness respectively;\n- \u00c5 Funding valuation adjustment. The funding valuation adjustment incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the/uni00A0valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives;\n- \u00c5 Own credit adjustment. An own credit risk adjustment is applied to financial liabilities where it is believed that counterparties will consider ABN/uni00A0AMRO's creditworthiness when pricing such instruments;\n- \u00c5 Model valuation adjustments for any known limitations. Management assesses the appropriateness of any model used on/uni00A0an ongoing basis. To the extent that the price provided by internal models does not represent the fair value of/uni00A0the instrument, for instance in highly stressed market conditions, management makes adjustments to the model valuation to/uni00A0calibrate to other available pricing sources.\n\nWe believe our estimates of the fair value are adequate. However, the use of different models or assumptions could result in/uni00A0changes to our reported results.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Valuation control framework\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has designated controls and processes in place for determining the fair value of financial instruments. A process has been designed to ensure there are formalised review protocols for independent review and validation of fair values separate from those businesses entering into the transactions. This includes specific controls to ensure consistent pricing policies and procedures, incorporating disciplined price verification for both market and counterparty risk trades.\n\nThe business entering into the transaction is responsible for the initial determination and recording of the fair value of the transaction. There are daily controls of the profit or loss recorded by trading and treasury front-office staff.\n\nA key element of the control environment, segregated from the recording of the transaction's valuation, is the independent price-verification process. Valuations are first calculated by the business. Such valuations may be current bid or offer prices in an active market, or may be derived using a model and variable model inputs. These valuations are reviewed and, if necessary, amended by the independent price-verification process. This process involves a team, independent of those trading the financial instruments, performing a review of valuations in the light of available pricing evidence. Independent price verification is frequently performed by matching the business valuations with independent data sources. For liquid instruments, the process is performed daily. The minimum frequency of review is monthly, both for trading positions and non-trading positions. The independent price-verification control includes formalised reporting and escalation to management of any valuation differences in breach of defined thresholds. When models are used to value products, those models are subject to a model review process. This process requires different levels of model documentation, testing and review, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of our exposure to the model.\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nA number of methodologies are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which observable prices in active markets for identical instruments are not available. Values between and beyond available data points are obtained by interpolation and/or extrapolation. When valuation techniques are used, the fair value can be significantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions made concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash flows, discount rates and credit risk.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nThis category includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, options and forward rate agreements. These products are valued by estimating future cash flows and discounting those cash flows, using appropriate interest rate curves. The exception is interest option contracts, which are valued using market standard option pricing models. The inputs for the discounting cash flow models are principally observable benchmark interest rates in active markets such as the interbank rates and quoted interest rates in the swap, bond and futures markets. The inputs for credit spreads - where available are/uni00A0derived from prices of credit default swaps or other credit-based instruments, such as debt securities. In other cases, credit spreads are obtained from pricing services. The additional inputs for the option pricing models are price volatilities and correlations, which are obtained from broker quotations or pricing services or derived from option prices. Because of the observability of the inputs used in the valuation models, the majority of the interest rate derivative contracts are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, credit spreads, correlations or volatilities are based on significant unobservable inputs, the contracts are classified as level 3. Exchange traded options and futures are valued using quoted market prices and are hence classified as level 1.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nForeign exchange contracts include foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange swaps. The majority of the foreign exchange contracts at ABN/uni00A0AMRO are traded as over-the-counter derivatives. These instruments are valued using foreign currency exchange rates. There are observable markets both for spot and forward contracts and for futures in the world's major currencies. The over-the-counter foreign exchange contracts are therefore classified as level 2.\n\n## Government debt securities\n\nGovernment debt securities consist of government bonds and bills with fixed or floating rate interest payments issued by sovereign governments. These instruments are generally traded in active markets and prices can be derived directly from those markets. Therefore the instruments are classified as level 1. Highly liquid bonds are valued using exchange traded prices. Less liquid bonds are valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services. For a minority of the government debt securities, active market prices are not available. In these cases ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses discounted cash flow valuation techniques that incorporate observable market\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "data for similar government instruments. The main inputs are interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The/uni00A0instruments for which this method applies are classified as level 2. If adjustments to any of the main inputs are made based on significant unobservable inputs, the instrument is classified as level 3.\n\n## Corporate debt securities\n\nCorporate debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds and other debt securities issued by corporate entities. Most/uni00A0of these instruments are standard fixed or floating rate securities. Corporate debt securities are generally valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services. These/uni00A0instruments are classified as level 1. If observable market prices are not available, ABN/uni00A0AMRO uses discounted cash flow valuation techniques, based on inputs derived from comparable instruments and credit default swap data of the issuer, to estimate credit spreads. These instruments are classified as level 2.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity instruments that are actively traded on public stock exchanges are valued using the readily available quoted prices and/uni00A0are therefore classified as level 1. Investments in private equity funds are initially recognised at their transaction price and remeasured to the extent reliable information is available on a case-by-case basis and are classified as level 3.\n\n## Loans and advances at fair value through profit or loss\n\nLoans and advances at fair value through profit or loss primarily consist of contracts with corporate clients where the contractual cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements. The return on these contracts with embedded derivatives is based on the price of underlying commodity contracts or loans with a floating interest rate. Discounted cash flow models are used to value these contracts. The main inputs are interest rate curves, quoted commodity prices, liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The instruments are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit spreads are based on significant unobservable inputs, the instruments are classified as level 3.\n\n## Issued debt\n\nIssued debt securities are valued using discounted cash flow models, based on current interest rate curves that incorporate observable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 2. When there are no, or only limited, publicly quoted prices available for these instruments and unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the fair value calculation, these instruments are classified as level 3.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets and products develop and as the pricing for individual products becomes more or less readily available. While ABN/uni00A0AMRO believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO analyses financial instruments held at fair value in the three categories described below.\n\nLevel 1 financial instruments are those that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.\n\nLevel 2 financial instruments are those valued using techniques based primarily on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets that are not considered to be active, or using valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are/uni00A0directly or indirectly based on observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments are those valued using a valuation technique where at least one input with a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. The effect of fair value adjustments on the instrument's valuation is included in the assessment.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Polish bond, denominated in euros (in Note 16 Financial investments, and part of Other OECD governments), for which the market is relatively illiquid. This bond is valued using a discounted cash flow model. The main inputs are the interest rate curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The valuation spread is determined using an internal model. The sensitivity analysis is performed using a range of reasonable valuation spreads.\n\n## Interest-earning securities - other\n\nPreference shares are shares for which the dividend is fixed for a period of ten years, after which the dividend is redetermined, and the shares can also be redeemed. The position is valued using a discounted cash flow model, for which the relevant inputs are the interest curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The liquidity spread and credit spread are unobservable inputs and are derived from similar securities. The sensitivity of the preference shares is determined by using a/uni00A0range of reasonable spreads and by considering the call option held by the issuer.\n\n## Equity shares - Preferred shares\n\nEquities measured at fair value through profit and loss and classified as level 3 mainly comprise private equity investments. Private equity shares are measured at fair value, with two calculation techniques being applied:\n\n- \u00c5 Using comparable pricing in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines (IPEV). This valuation technique is based on earnings multiples of comparable listed and unlisted companies. The fair value calculation of an investment is strongly linked with movements on public equity markets;\n- \u00c5 Net Asset Value (NAV) for fund investments and asset-backed investments. This is determined by using audited and unaudited company financial statements and any other information available, publicly or otherwise. As a consequence, the/uni00A0net asset value calculation of an investment is strongly linked to movements in the quarterly performance of the company and can be used as an indicator of fair value.\n\nNew investments are initially valued at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value technique, either EVCA technique or NAV calculation, is applied for direct investments.\n\nThe sensitivity for using comparable pricing is determined by stressing the earnings multiples in a positive and negative market scenario, whereas sensitivity testing for the NAV calculation based upon the quarterly performance cannot be applied.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

For counterparties that do not have an observable credit spread, ABN/uni00A0AMRO applies a proxied credit spread extracted from counterparties of comparable credit quality that do have an observable credit spread. ABN/uni00A0AMRO performs a probability of default assessment for each counterparty and allocates an appropriate internal credit risk measure known as a Uniform Counterparty Rating (UCR). This UCR, which is significant to the entire fair value measurement of the derivative contracts included in the following table of level 3 sensitivity information, is internally generated and is therefore an unobservable input.\n\n|                                                        | Valuation   technique     | Unobservable  data           | Carrying  value   | Possible alternative  assumptions   | Possible alternative  assumptions   | Unobservable   data range   | Unobservable   data range   | Unobservable  data base   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                   |                           |                              |                   | Applying  minimum                   | Applying  maximum                   | Applying  minimum           | Applying  maximum           |                           |\n| 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020                         |                           |                              |                   |                                     |                                     |                             |                             |                           |\n| Equity shares                                          | Private equity  valuation | EBITDA  multiples            | 73                | -7                                  | 7                                   | 5.0                         | 6.0                         | 5.5                       |\n| Equity shares                                          | Private equity  valuation | Net asset  value             | 496               | -45                                 | 40                                  |                             |                             |                           |\n| Interest-earning securities  -/uni00A0government bonds | Discounted  cash flow     | Liquidity and  credit spread | 473               | -19                                 | 11                                  | 31                          | 100                         | 56                        |\n| Interest-earning securities  -

Loans and advances for which the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at amortised cost, i.e. fair value at initial recognition, adjusted for repayment and amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the/uni00A0effective interest rate of the asset. Loans and advances that do not pass the SPPI test are measured at fair value through profit or loss./uni00A0Please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and to Credit risk management in the Risk, funding & capital chapter (Accounting policy for measuring allowances for credit losses).\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                          | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Interest-bearing deposits                     | 1,739                            | 1,508                            |\n| Loans and advances                            | 1,339                            | 1,784                            |\n| Mandatory reserve deposits with central banks | 220                              | 293                              |\n| Other loans and advances banks                | 101                              | 1,431                            |\n| Subtotal                                      | 3,399                            | 5,016                            |\n| Less: loan impairment allowances              | 6                                | 5                                |\n| Loans and advances banks                      | 3,394                            | 5,011                            |\n\nLoans and advances banks decreased by EUR/uni00A01.6 billion to EUR/uni00A03.4 billion at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, mainly due to a decrease in other loans and advances.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 21  Fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value\n\n## Accounting policy for fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value\n\nThe categorisation and valuation of financial instruments not carried at fair value is determined in accordance with the/uni00A0accounting policies set out in Note 18 Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value.\n\n## Valuation methodologies\n\nThe methods and assumptions described below have been applied to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value. These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Note that the fair value can be significantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash flows, discount rates, credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\n## Short-term financial instruments\n\nThe carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) of financial instruments maturing within a period of less than three months or that have no contractual maturity are assumed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value. For certain instruments, behavioural maturities are applied.\n\nShort-term financial instruments are classified as level 2 as unobservable inputs (such as inputs to determine credit risk, prepayment risk and liquidity risk) do not have a significant influence in determining the fair value.\n\n## Cash and balances at central banks\n\nCash and balances at central banks are classified as level 1 as these instruments have a short-term nature, prices from an active market are available and no fair value adjustments are made to the carrying amounts.\n\n## Securities financing\n\nSecurities financing includes repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments and the value and liquidity of available collateral, the carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) are considered to approximate the fair value. Securities financing amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Loans and advances/uni00A0banks and customers\n\nThe fair value of loans and advances banks and/uni00A0customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on contractual cash flows, using actual yields and discounting by risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are applied and prepayment options are included in the estimated fair value. The calculations are adjusted for credit risk by incorporating the expected credit losses over the estimated lifetime of the loan, based on parameters including probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The loans and advances are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The loans and advances for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2. Behavioural maturities instead of contractual maturities are used to determine the level classification of a small part of the portfolio.\n\nCash collateral paid to counterparties in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) is included in loans and advances banks and/uni00A0loans and advances customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate the carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Due to banks and customers\n\nThe fair value of instruments such as deposits and borrowings included in due to banks and customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are applied. Amounts due to banks and customers are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The financial instruments for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2. For the majority of the portfolio, behavioural maturities are used to determine the level classification.\n\nCash collateral liabilities in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) are included in due to banks and customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate the carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Issued debt and subordinated liabilities\n\nThe fair value of issued debt securities and subordinated liabilities is based on quoted prices. If these are not available, the fair value is based on a market approach in which independent quotes from market participants are used for the debt issuance spreads above the average interbank offered rates (over a range of tenors) that the market would demand when purchasing new senior or subordinated debt from ABN/uni00A0AMRO. Where necessary, these quotes are interpolated, using a curve shape derived from CDS prices.\n\n|                                    | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020

        "page_content": "## 22  Bank structure\n\n## Accounting policy for business combinations\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the bank. All/uni00A0items of consideration, including contingent consideration, transferred by ABN/uni00A0AMRO are measured and recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Transaction costs incurred by ABN/uni00A0AMRO in connection with the business combination, other than those associated with the issuance of debt and equity securities, do not form part of the cost of/uni00A0the business combination transaction but are expensed as incurred. The excess of the purchase consideration over ABN/uni00A0AMRO's share of/uni00A0the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired (including certain contingent liabilities) is recorded as goodwill.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the fair value at the acquisition date. In a/uni00A0step acquisition, where a/uni00A0business combination occurs in stages and control of the business is obtained in stages, the/uni00A0identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are recognised at fair value when control is obtained. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss as the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree and its carrying amount. Changes in interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a/uni00A0change of control are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity.\n\n## Accounting policy for subsidiaries\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by ABN/uni00A0AMRO's ability to exercise its power in order to affect the variable returns that it is exposed to through its involvement in the entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account when assessing whether control exists.\n\nThe assessment of control is based on consideration of all facts and circumstances. The bank reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control (power, exposure to variability in returns, and a/uni00A0link between the two).\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO sponsors entities, including certain special purpose entities, which may or may not be directly owned, for the purpose of asset securitisation transactions and other specific and well-defined objectives. Particularly in the case of securitisations, these entities may acquire assets from ABN/uni00A0AMRO companies. Some of these entities hold assets that are not available to meet the claims of creditors of ABN/uni00A0AMRO or its subsidiaries. These entities are consolidated in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's financial statements when the substance of the relationship between ABN/uni00A0AMRO and the entity indicates that/uni00A0control is held by ABN/uni00A0AMRO.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO is mainly involved in securitisations of own originated assets, such as various consumer and commercial financial assets. This process generally necessitates a/uni00A0sale of these assets to a/uni00A0special purpose entity (SPE), which in turn issues securities to investors. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's interests in securitised assets may be retained in the form of senior or subordinated tranches, issued guarantees, interest-only strips or other residual interests, together referred to as retained interests. In many cases, these retained interests convey control, such that the SPE is consolidated and the securitised assets continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries and special purpose entities are included in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\n## Accounting policy for associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are those entities in which ABN/uni00A0AMRO has significant influence on, but no control or joint control over, the operating and financial policies. Significant influence is generally presumed when ABN/uni00A0AMRO holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered in assessing whether ABN/uni00A0AMRO has significant influence. Among other factors, representation on the board of directors, participation in the policy-making process and material transactions between the entity and the investee are considered to determine significant influence.\n\nA joint venture is an investment in which two or more parties have contractually agreed to share control over the investment. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the/uni00A0parties sharing control. The activities conducted through joint ventures include cash transfers, insurance, finance and/uni00A0leasing.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Investments in associates and joint ventures, including strategic investments, are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased (or decreased) for post-acquisition net income (or loss), other movements impacting on the equity of the investee and any adjustments required for impairment. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognised in Share of result in equity accounted investements. If/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to zero, including any other unsecured receivables, and recognition of further losses is discontinued except if ABN/uni00A0AMRO has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nEquity investments held without significant influence and which are not held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss as ABN/uni00A0AMRO does not apply the option to measure such investments at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Assets and liabilities of acquisitions and divestments\n\nThe following table provides details of the assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries and equity accounted investments at the date of acquisition or disposal.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                   | Acquisitions   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 Divestments   | Acquisitions   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019 Divestments   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Assets and liabilities of acquisitions and divestments |                |                                              |                |                                              |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                     |                |                                              | 521            |                                              |\n| Derivatives                                            |                |                                              |                | -3                                           |\n| Financial investments                                  |                |                                              | 76             |                                              |\n| Loans and advances banks                               |                |                                              | 123            |                                              |\n|                                                        |                |                                              |                | -2,668                                       |\n| Loans and advances customers                           |                |                                              | 519            | -583                                         |\n| Equity-accounted investments                           | 24             | -10                                          | 97             | -

In addition, ABN/uni00A0AMRO paid a purchase premium of EUR/uni00A047/uni00A0million, which included EUR/uni00A019/uni00A0million for the obtained client relationships. ABN/uni00A0AMRO recognised an amount of EUR/uni00A028/uni00A0million as goodwill based on synergies expected from integrating the private banking activities of/uni00A0Societe Generale/uni00A0in Belgium with those of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. This goodwill was included in the annual impairment test. No impairment was recognised. The purchased private banking activities did not contribute significantly to ABN/uni00A0AMRO's income statement for 2019. In/uni00A0September/uni00A02019, the acquired business merged with the ABN/uni00A0AMRO Belgium branch.\n\nAcquisitions include several small investments in equity associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Divestments in 2019\n\nOn 28/uni00A0March/uni00A02019, ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced that it had reached agreement to sell 75% of its shares in Stater N.V. to Infosys.

The book gain amounted to EUR/uni00A0130/uni00A0million,/uni00A0the portion of gain attributable to measuring the investment retained in Stater N.V. at its/uni00A0fair value at the date when control was lost amounted to EUR/uni00A034/uni00A0million.\n\nOn 15/uni00A0July/uni00A02019, ABN/uni00A0AMRO announced the closing and finalisation of the sale of ABN/uni00A0AMRO (Channel Islands) Limited to/uni00A0Bank of N.T.

The carrying amount recognised in the balance sheet was EUR/uni00A0593/uni00A0million. The difference relates mainly to a restriction on the equity of Nederlandse Financieringsmaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. and to a lesser extent to timing discrepancies between valuation date and reporting date and impairments taken on associates and joint ventures.\n\n## Impairments on equity-accounted investments\n\nThe following table shows the changes in impairments on equity-accounted investments.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)              | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as at 1 January           | 5      | 5      |\n| Increase in impairments           | 12     | 1      |\n| Reversal of impairment allowances |        |        |\n| Other                             |        | -1     |\n| Balance as at 31 December         | 17     | 5      |\n\n## Structured entities\n\nStructured entities are entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nA structured entity has some or all of the following features or attributes:\n\n- \u00c5 Restricted activities;\n- \u00c5 Narrow and well-defined objective;\n- \u00c5 Insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated/uni00A0financial support;\n- \u00c5 Financing, in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments, to investors that creates/uni00A0concentrations of credit or other risks;\n- \u00c5 Relevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

Retained notes are/uni00A0used for repo transactions and TLTRO, for example.\n\nThe securitisation transactions were primarily used for funding and liquidity purposes. There was no RWA (REA) relief at/uni00A031/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: no relief).\n\nIn 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO had only traditional securitisation transactions outstanding./uni00A0In such transactions, a/uni00A0foundation (stichting) incorporates a bankruptcy-remote, structured entity, to which the legal title of/uni00A0a portfolio of receivables is sold. As ABN/uni00A0AMRO continues to recognise the assets after the legal title has been sold, no derecognition takes place. The structured entity issues notes to fund the purchase. ABN/uni00A0AMRO performs key ancillary roles in all its/uni00A0securitisation transactions, including as swap counterparty.\n\n## Risks associated with the roles in the securitisation process Credit risk\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of credit losses on securitised assets. ABN/uni00A0AMRO retains part of the credit risk by retaining notes and other securitisation positions such as liquidity facilities, swaps and first loss tranches. Regulatory capital is held for/uni00A0all retained securitisation positions in accordance with the applicable regulation.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk relates to the risk that ABN/uni00A0AMRO may incur additional cash outflows. Any potential future cash outflows relating to these positions, including collateral requirements, are taken into account within stress tests and are integrated into the liquidity ratios, where required. This includes the potential impact of the liquidity facilities or swap agreements which form part of certain securitisation transactions, most of which relate to transactions where ABN/uni00A0AMRO is the originator of the underlying assets.\n\n## Approaches to calculating risk exposure amount\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO does not achieve significant risk transfers for any of the mortgage securitisations.\n\n## Monitoring process\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO periodically monitors changes in credit risk relating to securitisation exposures. The significance of the amount of credit risk transferred to third parties by securitisation of own originated assets is assessed on a monthly basis in accordance with the regulatory significant risk transfer test. For investments in third-party securitisations, the risk is monitored by reviewing the investor reports of these transactions. Additionally, third-party securitisation positions are included in the firm-wide comprehensive stress tests in which the downgrade and default risks under stressed market conditions are assessed\n\n## Overview of securitisation positions and securitised assets\n\nThe total amount of assets securitised in securitisations decreased to EUR/uni00A014.3 billion at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A017.2 billion).

        "page_content": "## Support to consolidated structured entities\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to a consolidated structured entity, including when ABN/uni00A0AMRO was not contractually obliged to do so, and nor does ABN/uni00A0AMRO intend to do so in the future.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nUnconsolidated structured entities are entities over which ABN/uni00A0AMRO has no control or significant influence. ABN/uni00A0AMRO is involved with structured entities through securitisation of financial assets and investments in structured entities. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are collateralised by the assets held by the structured entities. The debt and equity securities issued by the structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination. The interest in unconsolidated structured entities increased by EUR/uni00A00.4/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A04.3/uni00A0billion at year-end/uni00A02020 (2019: EUR/uni00A03.9/uni00A0billion). The interests consist mainly of/uni00A0debt securities in corporate loans of EUR/uni00A0414/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A0257/uni00A0million) and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities recognised under financial investments of EUR/uni00A03.5/uni00A0billion (2019: EUR/uni00A03.7/uni00A0billion). The maximum exposure to/uni00A0losses/uni00A0from these interests is equal to the total carrying amount.\n\n## Sponsoring of unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAn entity is considered a sponsor of an unconsolidated structured entity if it had a key role in establishing that entity so/uni00A0that the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur. No sponsoring occurred during/uni00A02020.\n\n## 23  Property and equipment, leases, goodwill and other/uni00A0intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policy for property and equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment amount. At each balance sheet date, an assessment is performed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in an enhancement to the asset. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a/uni00A0straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment, and of major components that are accounted for separately. ABN/uni00A0AMRO generally uses the following useful lives in calculating depreciation:\n\n- \u00c5 Land: not depreciated;\n- \u00c5 Buildings: 30 years;\n- \u00c5 Leasehold improvements: 5 years;\n- \u00c5 Equipment: 5 years;\n- \u00c5 Installations (durable): 10 years;\n- \u00c5 Computer installations: 2 to 5 years.\n\nAt each reporting date, ABN AMRO reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (i.e. ROU assets, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. In general, ABN/uni00A0AMRO's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are used by more than one cashgenerating unit. Corporate assets are allocated to cash-generating units on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for/uni00A0impairment as part of the testing of the cash-generating unit to which the corporate assets are allocated.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss under depreciation and amortisation expenses. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the cash-generating unit on a pro rata basis.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement as a component of depreciation and amortisation expense. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised.\n\nDepreciation rates and residual values are reviewed at least periodically to take into account any change in circumstances. Capitalised leasehold improvements are depreciated in a manner that takes into account the term and renewal conditions of/uni00A0the related lease.\n\nAssets for which the bank acts as a lessor in an operational lease contract are included in property and equipment. The/uni00A0asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis, over its useful life, to its estimated residual value.\n\n## Accounting policy for leases\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nWhere ABN/uni00A0AMRO acts as lessor, a distinction is made between operating and finance leases. Leases where the bank transfers substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. Leases that do not transfer these risks and rewards are classified as operating leases. Finance leases are recognised as a receivable in loans and advances at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease, less credit loss allowances. Assets subject to operating leases are recognised at cost in property and equipment. Operating income from finance leases is recognised in a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nAll leases, except for low-value leases and leases with a duration of less than one year, are recognised on the balance sheet as a right of use (ROU) asset and lease liability. As a lessee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO enters into various lease contracts, mainly for office buildings and cars that the bank leases for its own use. When accounting for the contracts as a lessee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO separates non-lease components from lease components. Payments such as variable lease payments and non-lease components are not included in the lease liability. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which reflects the initial lease liability, adjusted for upfront lease payments, received incentives and initial direct costs. The initial lease liability is equal to the sum of the fixed lease payments, discounted by the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe ROU asset is depreciated over the period of the lease, using the straight-line method./uni00A0\n\nAdjustments to the ROU asset and corresponding lease liability result from remeasurement and/or modification. Remeasurement occurs when there is a change in the lease term or discount rate, or when ABN/uni00A0AMRO changes its assessment regarding purchase, extension or termination options. A lease modification is a change in the scope of the lease, or the consideration of a part of a lease that was not in the original terms and conditions of the lease. A lease modification results in either a separate additional lease or a change in the accounting for the existing lease. In the case of a lease modification not resulting in an additional lease, the lease liability is remeasured by adjusting the carrying amount of the ROU asset and, to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease, recognising any gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nExpenses related to short-term leases with a term of less than 12 months and leases of low-value are recognised in the income statement. ROU assets are included in the line item Property and equipment, while the lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities. Depreciation of the ROU assets is included in the line item for depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible assets in the income statement, and interest expense on lease liabilities is included in the line item Other interest and similar expense.\n\n## Accounting policy for intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is capitalised and stated at cost, being the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's share of the acquired entity's net identifiable assets at the acquisition date, less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of calculating goodwill, the fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred. In the test, the carrying amount of goodwill is compared with the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use, being\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

In its capacity as lessee, ABN/uni00A0AMRO leases various assets, mainly office properties, cars and equipment that serve to support the bank's operations. The leases have various terms and termination and renewal options. The majority of termination and renewal options are exercisable only by the bank and not by the respective lessor. There are no variable lease payments present in lease contracts where ABN/uni00A0AMRO acts as lessee. No covenants are present in the lease agreements and ABN/uni00A0AMRO is not allowed to use leased assets as security for financing purposes. The total cash outflow relating to leases in 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A0105/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A081/uni00A0million).\n\nThe following table shows the maturity of lease liabilities for leases in which the bank acts as lessee, as well as the future undiscounted minimum lease receipts under operating and financial leases where ABN/uni00A0AMRO acts as lessor. It also reconciles the total future minimum lease receipts under financial leases and the net investment in the leases.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial\n\nStatements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual\n\nFinancial/uni00A0Statements\n\nof/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2020 the/uni00A0total income from subleasing ROU assets amounted to EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million.\n\nThe impairment loss of EUR 44 million in 2020 mainly represents the full write-down of the right-of-use assets of the international offices, other intangible assets and equipment of the CIB non-core business in APAC, US and Brazil as a result of the wind-down strategy announced in August 2020. The impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss under depreciation and amortisation expense. The recoverable amount of nil as at 31 December 2020 is based on the value in use and determined at the level of the cash-generating unit. The cash-generating unit consists of the CIB non-core entities in APAC, US and Brazil, which are part of the CIB operating segment.\n\n## Valuation of goodwill\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                   | Segment                     | Method used  for recoverable  amount   | Discount  rate   | Long-term  growth  rate   | Impairment  charges   | Goodwill   | Goodwill   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Entity                                                 |                             |                                        |                  |                           |                       |            |            |\n| Bethmann Bank A.G.                                     | Private Banking             | Value in use                           | 10.0%            | 0.0%                      |                       | 63         | 63         |\n| ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V.

Market reference data for determining the fair value less costs of disposal were updated by the inclusion of/uni00A0a/uni00A0discount to reflect the impact of Covid-19. Forecasts for calculating the value in use were also updated to incorporate the effects of Covid-19.\n\nThe outcome of the impairment test of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (Belgium) Branch entails a full impairment of goodwill, totalling/uni00A0EUR 28 million as at Q2 2020. The recoverable amount of EUR 148 million is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The valuation method of fair value less costs of disposal is a level-3 fair value determination based on parameters from recent Private Banking merger and acquisition transactions by ABN AMRO, which are cross-referenced with external Private Banking mergers and acquisitions known in the relevant markets.

The increase of EUR/uni00A00.2 billion is a result of the clearing business that is fully based on the nature of the business to supply in the needs of clients' financing strategies and related transactions to be settled.\n\nTrade and other receivables include receivables purchased by ABN/uni00A0AMRO (the factor) from its clients under non-recourse factoring contracts. The increase of EUR/uni00A00.5 billion relates mainly to higher funds transferred to notary offices due to mortgage production.\n\nOther assets in 2020 and 2019 includes a net receivable of EUR/uni00A00.2 billion related to the bankruptcy of DSB Bank.\n\n## 26  Due to banks\n\n## Accounting policy for due to banks and due to customers\n\nAmounts due to banks and customers are held at amortised cost.

This increase was partly offset by the settlement of the old TLTRO agreement, which resulted in a decrease of EUR/uni00A08.0 billion.\n\nThe funding obtained under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations III (TLTRO III) is included in Time deposits./uni00A0With the TLTROs the ECB offers banks long-term funding at attractive conditions, with the aim to further incentivise bank/uni00A0lending to the real economy. The maturity of the TLTRO III funding is three years, with a quarterly early repayment option as/uni00A0of September 2021. Interest will be settled in arrears. The interest rate to be applied is linked to the issuance of new loans/uni00A0to non-financial corporations and households. The funding is accounted for at amortised cost, with an effective interest rate/uni00A0equal to the Main Refinancing Operations rate. For the period of 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2022, a discount of 50bps/uni00A0is granted, irrespective of lending performance. The guaranteed discount of 50bps is accounted for as a government/uni00A0grant and recognised in interest income. Any additional discount achieved based on ABN AMRO's lending performance will/uni00A0also be accounted for as a government grant. Given the current economic circumstances and uncertainties related to Covid-19,/uni00A0ABN AMRO did not recognise any additional discount in 2020.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hybrid or structured financial liabilities are irrevocably designated upon initial recognition to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. The latter is applied when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch, are managed on the basis of their fair value or include terms that qualify as an embedded derivative that cannot be separated.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation to determine whether funding is a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as financial liabilities where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in ABN/uni00A0AMRO having a present obligation to deliver either cash or another financial asset or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed number of equity shares.\n\nIssued liabilities qualify as subordinated debt if claims by the holders are subordinated to all other current and future liabilities of ABN/uni00A0AMRO and its subsidiaries./uni00A0\n\nThe valuation of liabilities measured at fair value includes the effect of changes in the bank's own credit spreads. The change in fair value applies to those financial liabilities designated at fair value where own value credit risk would be considered by market participants . The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of issued debt is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity. Exchange-traded own debt measured at fair value through profit or loss is valued at market prices.\n\nFair value changes are calculated based on a yield curve generated from observed external pricing for funding and quoted CDS spreads.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

No perpetual loans were recorded at the reporting date. The issued and outstanding loans qualifying as subordinated liabilities are subordinated to all other current and future liabilities.\n\n## 29 Provisions\n\n## Accounting policy for provisions\n\nA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when ABN/uni00A0AMRO has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a/uni00A0past event, and it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect of time value is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market rates and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when ABN/uni00A0AMRO has approved a/uni00A0detailed plan and has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the plan by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features. Future operating costs are not provided for. Provisions for insurance risks are determined by/uni00A0actuarial methods, which include the use of statistics, interest rate data and settlement cost expectations.\n\nProvisions are established for certain guarantee contracts for which ABN/uni00A0AMRO is liable to pay upon default of payment. Expected credit loss allowances of loan commitments and financial guarantees are recognised as provisions under IFRS 9.\n\nThe following table shows the breakdown of provisions at 31/uni00A0December.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)              |   31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 |   31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019 |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Insurance fund liabilities        |                               11 |                                4 |\n| Provision for pension commitments |                              106 |                               74 |\n| Restructuring provision           |                              226 |                              172 |\n| Other staff provision             |                              136 |                              119 |\n| Legal provisions                  |                               98 |                              234 |\n| Credit commitments provisions     |                               92 |                               79 |\n| Other provisions                  |                              258 |                              301 |\n| Total provisions                  |                              926 |                              983 |\n\n## Insurance fund liabilities\n\nInsurance fund liabilities include the insurance companies' actuarial reserves, premium and claims reserves.

        "page_content": "## Restructuring\n\nRestructuring provisions cover the costs of the restructuring plans for which implementation has been formally announced. The increase in the restructuring provisions was mainly due to the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\n## Other staff provisions\n\nThe increase in Other staff provisions mainly relates to an increase in the provision for untaken holidays.\n\n## Legal provisions\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A0136/uni00A0million/uni00A0in legal provisions is mainly attributable to outflows from the provision related to interest rate derivatives sold to SME clients, combined with a release of EUR/uni00A018/uni00A0million. The provision related to Euribor-based mortgages declined due to outflows and a release.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives for SME clients\n\nIn 2015, ABN/uni00A0AMRO started a review, at the request of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and the Dutch Ministry of Finance, to determine whether the bank had acted in accordance with its duty of care obligations in respect of the sale of interest rate derivatives to SME clients. In the second quarter of 2015, ABN/uni00A0AMRO first recognised a provision for compensating clients who had been disadvantaged in this respect and suffered loss or damage.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has set up its own client reassessment process and the related checks and balances with respect to the Uniform Recovery Framework devised by a committee of independent experts ('the Committee') appointed by the Dutch Minister of Finance. In the first quarter of 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO finalised the process of sending all clients a letter containing the outcome of the reassessment. At various points in the process, the reassessments were checked by an independent external file reviewer (in ABN/uni00A0AMRO's case, by the audit firm PwC), supervised by the AFM. Except for a limited number of proceedings relating to the Uniform Recovery Framework before a dispute committee and the local courts, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has completed the execution of the Uniform Recovery Framework. The total provision for SME derivatives-related issues amounted to EUR/uni00A010/uni00A0million at 31 December/uni00A02020. This comprised the total amount of client compensation (EUR/uni00A00.6/uni00A0billion) and project costs (EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion), after payments already made for both elements (EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion).\n\n## Euribor-based mortgages\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has sold mortgage loans with floating, often Euribor-based, interest rates to consumers ('EuriborWoninghypotheek mortgages'). These rates are increased with a margin charge. Based on the applicable terms and conditions, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has the right to unilaterally adjust the margin charge. After ABN/uni00A0AMRO increased the margin charge in 2012, two class actions and multiple individual cases, were brought against ABN/uni00A0AMRO. The central question in these cases is whether ABN/uni00A0AMRO's contractual right to unilaterally adjust the margin charge is an unfair term that can be voided.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO lost the class action cases in two instances and decided to appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court. On 22/uni00A0November/uni00A02019 the Supreme Court quashed the ruling of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in the Euribor collective cases. The case has been referred to another Court of Appeal (The Hague) in order to be dealt with further. This Court will need to re-examine/uni00A0 whether the terms are unfair or not.\n\nOn 13 February 2020, ABN AMRO and the foundation Stichting Euribar reached an agreement on a settlement for clients with Euribor-Woninghypotheek mortgages. The key points of the settlement are 1) compensation for the past (62.5% of the increases in the margin charge in 2009 and 2012, calculated until 1 April 2019 at the latest and increased by statutory interest) and 2) agreement on the bandwith of the future margin charge (until 1 January 2025, the Euribor margin charge will remain fixed at the current Euribor margin charge of 1.0% (the rate from 2012), and beyond 1 January 2025 the margin charge may be raised to a maximum of 1.2%). By mid-February 2021, approximately 91% of the respective clients who were eligible for the settlement had received a personal offer from ABN AMRO. So far, 77% of this group have accepted the/uni00A0proposed settlement. The remaining 9% of the eligible clients are expected to receive a settlement offer in Q1 2021.\n\nStichting Stop de Banken, was not willing to participate in the settlement agreement and proceeded with the class action. ABN/uni00A0AMRO filed its defence documents with the Court of Appeal in The Hague on 9/uni00A0March/uni00A02021. Thereafter, parties can request an oral hearing or a judgement.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has recognised a provision for the Euribor-based mortgage cases.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

ABN AMRO invests significant resources in fulfilling its role as gatekeeper in general and specifically in combating financial crime, and works closely with regulators, governments, other banks and other authorities. ABN AMRO has further increased its ongoing efforts to strengthen its AML remediation programmes in order to be compliant with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation. We have implemented multiple remediation programmes, including for remediating the Retail client portfolio. We are also investing further resources in strengthening the necessary processes, as well as in further improving systems required to assist efforts to combat financial crime. The total provision regarding the AML programme amounted to EUR 176 million at 31 December 2020. On a general note, all remedial action necessary to ensure full, bank-wide compliance with legislation at all times will be taken.

These schemes are mainly defined contribution plans. The majority of the beneficiaries of the plans are located in the Netherlands.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, ABN/uni00A0AMRO pays annual contributions determined by a fixed method and/uni00A0has no legal or/uni00A0constructive obligation to pay any further contributions. Contributions are recognised directly in the income statement in/uni00A0the/uni00A0year to which they relate.

        "page_content": "## Defined benefit plans\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the net obligation of each plan is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of the plan's assets.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used for calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligations include discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds, the inflation rate, future salary increases, employee contributions, mortality assumptions and rates of employee turnover. The assumptions are based on available market data and management expectations at the end of the reporting period.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value at balance sheet date and are netted against the defined benefit obligations. Pension costs recognised in the income statement for defined benefit plans consist of:\n\n- \u00c5 service/uni00A0costs;\n- \u00c5 net interest costs determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the discount rate, both as at/uni00A0the start of the annual reporting period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments; and\n- \u00c5 curtailments or plan amendments.\n\nDifferences between pension costs and pension contributions payable are accounted for as provisions or prepayments.\n\n## Remeasurement\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) are actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (i.e. unexpectedly high or low rates of employee turnover). They are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not recycled to profit or loss in later periods. The actual return on the pension plan's assets is determined after deduction of the costs of managing the assets and any tax payable by the pension plan itself.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nSome group companies provide post-retirement benefits to their retirees, such as long-term service benefits and discounts on banking products. Entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.\n\nThe expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. These obligations are calculated annually.\n\nPlans in all countries comply with applicable local regulations concerning investments and minimum funding levels.\n\n## Pension and other employee/uni00A0benefits\n\n## Amounts recognised in the income statement for pensions and other/uni00A0employee benefits\n\n|                                                                      | 2020                              | 2020                      | 2020   | 2019                              | 2019                      | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                 | Defined post  employment  benefit | Other  employee  benefits | Total  | Defined post  employment  benefit | Other  employee  benefits | Total  |\n| Current service cost                                                 | 6                                 | 21                        | 27     | 4                                 | 5                         | 9      |\n| Interest cost                                                        | 2                                 |                           | 2      | 3                                 | 1                         | 5      |\n| Interest income                                                      | -1                                |                           | -1     | -2                                |                           | -2     |\n| Other                                                                | -1                                | 2                         | 1      |                                   | 1                         | 1      |\n| Total defined benefit expenses in actuarial report                   | 6                                 | 23                        | 29     | 5                                 | 8                         | 13     |\n| Other expenses                                                       | -5                                |                           | -5     | -6                                | -3                        | -9     |\n| Total defined benefit expenses                                       | 1                                 | 23                        | 24     | -1                                | 5                         | 4      |\n| Defined contribution plans                                           | 306                               |                           | 306    | 372                               |                           | 372    |\n| Total pension expenses and other post retirement   employee benefits | 307                               | 23                        | 330    | 371                               | 5                         | 376    |\n\nTotal pension and other employee benefits expenses decreased by EUR/uni00A046/uni00A0million.

The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of such liabilities is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nOther reserves mainly comprise retained earnings and profit for the period.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on ordinary shares classified as equity are recognised as a/uni00A0distribution of equity in the/uni00A0period in which they are approved by shareholders.\n\n## Capital securities\n\nUndated, deeply subordinated, resettable, callable capital securities are classified as additional tier 1 (AT1) capital, under/uni00A0total equity.

Please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies.\n\nPledged assets are assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities and the terms and conditions relating to/uni00A0the pledge. Encumbered assets are those that are pledged or other assets that we believe to be restricted in order to secure, credit-enhance or collateralise a transaction.\n\nIn principle, pledged assets are encumbered assets. The following differences apply to ABN/uni00A0AMRO:\n\n- \u00c5 Encumbered assets include mandatory reserve requirements with central banks;\n- \u00c5 Encumbered assets exclude assets pledged for unused credit facilities with central banks at the statement of financial position date, i.e. mainly retained mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSignificant restrictions on assets may arise from statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements such as:\n\n- \u00c5 Those that restrict the ability of the parent or its subsidiaries to transfer cash or other financial assets to or from/uni00A0other/uni00A0entities within the group;\n- \u00c5 Guarantees or other requirements that may restrict dividends and other capital distributions being paid, or loans and/uni00A0advances being made or repaid to other entities within the group;\n- \u00c5 Protective rights of other non-controlling interests that may restrict the ability of the bank/uni00A0to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the group/uni00A0and to settle liabilities of the bank.\n\n## Transferred financial assets\n\nThis disclosure provides insight into the relationship between transferred financial assets and associated financial liabilities in order to show the risks the bank is exposed to when assets are transferred. If transferred financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank is still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.\n\n## Transferred financial assets not derecognised in their entirety\n\nThe following table shows transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

procedures for transferred assets. Comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly (EUR/uni00A01.6 billion).\n\n## Securitisations\n\nThe bank uses securitisations as a source of funding, whereby a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) issues debt securities. In a securitisation transaction utilising traditional mechanics, the bank transfers the title of the assets to SPEs. When the cash flows are transferred to investors in the notes issued by consolidated securitisation vehicles, the assets (mainly residential mortgage loans) are considered to be transferred. The bank did not have any transferred and associated securitisations at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020.\n\n## Securities financing\n\nSecurities financing transactions are entered into on a collateralised basis for mitigating the bank's credit risk exposure. In repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions, ABN/uni00A0AMRO gets the securities returned at maturity. The counterparty in the transactions holds the securities as collateral, but has no recourse to other assets of ABN/uni00A0AMRO. ABN/uni00A0AMRO transfers the securities and if the counterparty has the right to resell or repledge them, the bank considers these assets to be transferred assets.\n\n## Continuing involvement in transferred financial assets derecognised in their entirety\n\nThe bank does not have any material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety, but where ABN/uni00A0AMRO has/uni00A0continuing involvement.\n\n## Pledged and encumbered assets\n\nPledged and encumbered assets are no longer readily available to the bank to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs or be/uni00A0sold to reduce the funding requirement. The following activities conducted by ABN/uni00A0AMRO give rise to pledged assets:\n\n- \u00c5 Cash and securities provided as collateral to secure trading and other liabilities, mainly derivatives;\n- \u00c5 Mortgages and SME loans pledged to secure funding transactions such as covered bonds and securitisations;\n- \u00c5 Securities lent as part of repurchase and securities lending transactions.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary in standard professional securities transactions.\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO controls the credit risk associated with these activities by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value on a daily basis and, when necessary, requiring additional collateral to be deposited with or returned to the bank.\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                             | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Fair value of securities received which can be sold or repledged | 57,436                           | 59,478                           |\n| - of which: fair value of securities repledged/sold to others    | 41,454                           | 46,712                           |\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO has the obligation to return securities accepted as collateral to its counterparties.\n\n## Significant restrictions on the ability to access or use the bank's assets\n\nRestricted financial assets consist of assets pledged as collateral against an existing or contingent liability and encumbered assets. Other restrictions impacting on the bank's ability to use assets include:\n\n- \u00c5 Assets as a result of collateralising repurchase and borrowing agreements (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020: EUR/uni00A016.7 billion; 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A014.9 billion);\n- \u00c5 Assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with local liquidity requirements and that are subject to restrictions in terms of their transferability within the group (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020: EUR/uni00A00.9 billion; 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A02.8 billion);\n- \u00c5 ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. is in general not subject to any significant restrictions that would prevent the transfer of dividends and capital within the group, except for regulated subsidiaries that are required to maintain capital in order to comply with local regulations (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020: EUR/uni00A01.1 billion; 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A01.0 billion).\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 34  Commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Accounting policy for off-balance sheet items Commitments\n\nLoan commitments that allow for draw-down of a loan within the timeframe generally established by regulation or/uni00A0convention in the marketplace are not recognised as derivative financial instruments. Acceptances comprise undertakings by ABN/uni00A0AMRO to pay bills of exchange drawn on clients. ABN/uni00A0AMRO expects most acceptances to be settled simultaneously with the reimbursement from clients. Acceptances are not recognised in the balance sheet and/uni00A0are disclosed as commitments.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nA financial guarantee contract requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs if/uni00A0a/uni00A0specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Initial recognition of financial guarantee contracts is at their fair value. Subsequent measurement is at the higher of the amount of/uni00A0the expected credit loss and the amount initially recognised, less - when appropriate - the cumulative amount of income recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present/uni00A0obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the balance sheet, but disclosed if the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is more/uni00A0likely than not.\n\n## Committed credit facilities\n\nCommitments to provide credit take the form of approved but undrawn loans, revolving and underwriting facilities. New loan offers have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement period.\n\n## Guarantees and other commitments\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers to third parties. These transactions have fixed limits and generally extend for periods of up to 5 years. Expirations are not concentrated in any/uni00A0particular period. ABN/uni00A0AMRO also provides guarantees by acting as a settlement agent in securities borrowing and lending transactions.\n\nMany of the contingent liabilities and commitments are expected to expire without being paid out in whole or in part. This/uni00A0means that the amounts stated do not represent expected future cash flows. Additionally, guarantees and letters of/uni00A0credit are supported by varying levels of collateral.\n\nFurthermore, statements of liability within the meaning of Article 403, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code have been issued for/uni00A0a/uni00A0of ABN/uni00A0AMRO's affiliated companies (see also the overview of Major subsidiaries and participating interests in the Other chapter).\n\nThe committed credit facilities, guarantees and other commitments at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 and 2019 are summarised in the/uni00A0following table. The amounts stated in the table for commitments assume that amounts are fully paid out. The amounts shown in the table for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum amount ABN/uni00A0AMRO is exposed to if the contract parties completely fail to perform as contracted.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was partly offset by a rise in credit lines granted to commercial clients and higher outstanding credit offers for residential mortgages. In the latter case, this related to the fact that, despite Covid-19, the housing market in the Netherlands remained very active throughout 2020.\n\n## Investigation Dutch public prosecutor\n\nIn September 2019, the Dutch public prosecutor informed ABN AMRO that it was the subject of a criminal investigation relating to requirements under the Dutch Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism (in Dutch: Wwft) subsequent to inter alia regulatory findings of DNB in deficiencies in compliance with the Wwft. The scope of the investigation includes suspicions of non-compliance with the Wwft, such as having client files in good order, timely reporting of unusual transactions and discontinuing relationships with clients in due time and related suspicions of culpable money laundering (schuldwitwassen). The investigation is ongoing and ABN AMRO continues to fully cooperate. The timing of the completion and outcome of the investigation remain uncertain. The potential financial impact of the outcome of the investigation, which can be significant, cannot be estimated reliably at present. As such, no provision is recorded.\n\n## Variable interest rate complaints for consumer loans\n\nThe alternative dispute resolution body Kifid has given rulings on contractual terms that give credit providers the unconditional right to change the variable interest rate of loans provided to consumers (revolving credit and mortgage loans). In short, Kifid ruled that if the contractual term does not specify the grounds for changing the interest rate, the customer may/uni00A0expect the only relevant circumstances that can play a role in changing the interest rate to be market developments. As a result, the difference between the contractual rate and the average market rate is set at the moment the contract is entered into. From then on, the contractual rate should follow movements of the average market rate. In order to establish whether the credit provider followed market developments, Kifid compares the course of the contractual interest rate with certain average interest rates published by Statistics Netherlands and the Dutch Central Bank. In the event of deviations, it/uni00A0could lead to a possible repayment of the difference by the credit provider.\n\nABN AMRO has received similar complaints from customers. In a 15 July 2020 ruling, the Kifid Disputes Committee ruled that ABN AMRO had to recalculate the variable interest charged to a specific customer on a revolving credit. This ruling was upheld in a 3 March 2021 ruling by the Kifid Appeals Committee. ABN AMRO does not agree with the current rulings of Kifid on this matter and therefore considers taking several complaints cases to the civil courts. ABN AMRO has made a provision because it considers it more likely than not that there will be outflow on the basis of individual similar Kifid rulings until new/uni00A0civil case law becomes available. For civil case law, ABN AMRO considers it not more likely than not that there will be/uni00A0outflow, reason why no provision has been accounted for.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

ABN AMRO's legal predecessor, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V., ABN AMRO and several (former) subsidiaries were directly or indirectly involved in/uni00A0these transactions in the past in various roles. Certain criminal investigation proceedings relate to the activities of these entities and individuals involved at the time. This also resulted in search warrants being issued against ABN AMRO. ABN/uni00A0AMRO cooperates with these investigations. ABN AMRO has no knowledge of the results of any such investigation.\n\nFurthermore, ABN AMRO frequently receives information requests from German authorities in relation to other (criminal) investigations. ABN AMRO cooperates and provides the requested information to the extent possible. Although a number of subsidiaries associated with these transactions have been sold by means of a management buy-out, legal risks remain for ABN AMRO, in particular relating to criminal and civil law. All material tax issues with respect to ABN AMRO's reclaims for cum/ex transactions have been settled with the German tax authorities. With respect to cum/cum securities lending transactions with German counterparties as borrowers, ABN AMRO is exposed to civil law compensation claims from these counterparties for crediting entitlements that have been denied by the relevant German tax authorities. Based on the analyses performed, ABN AMRO considers it rather unlikely that such claims will be successful. However, it cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt cannot be excluded that ABN AMRO or subsidiaries will be faced with financial consequences as a result of their involvement in dividend stripping transactions, including penalties and other measures under criminal law and civil law claims. It is currently unclear, however, how the German prosecution authorities' investigations will impact ABN AMRO and its subsidiaries and to what extent penalties or forfeiture orders will be imposed. It is also uncertain whether tax authorities or third parties will successfully claim amounts from ABN AMRO in (secondary) liability or other civil cases. Therefore, the financial impact cannot be reliably estimated at this time and no provision has been made.\n\n## Duty of care matters\n\nA number of proceedings have been initiated against ABN/uni00A0AMRO for alleged breach of its duty of care in transparencyrelated standards. Where applicable, provisions for these matters have been made.\n\nThere can be no assurance that additional proceedings will not be brought or that amounts demanded in claims brought to date will not rise. Current proceedings are pending and their outcome, as well as the outcome of any threatened proceedings, is uncertain, as is the timing of reaching any finality on these legal claims and proceedings. Although the consequences could be substantial for ABN/uni00A0AMRO and potentially affect its reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, it is not possible to reliably estimate or quantify ABN/uni00A0AMRO's exposure at this time. These uncertainties are likely to continue for some time.\n\n## Cross-liability\n\nOn 6 February 2010, the former ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. demerged into two entities: NatWest Markets N.V. (formerly known as/uni00A0RBS N.V.) and ABN/uni00A0AMRO Bank N.V. On the division of an entity by demerger, Dutch law establishes a/uni00A0cross-liability between surviving entities for the benefit of the creditors at the time of the demerger. ABN/uni00A0AMRO's cross-liability amounts to EUR/uni00A01.4 billion (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A01.8 billion), for which NatWestMarkets N.V. has posted collateral of/uni00A0EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion (31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019: EUR/uni00A00.9 billion).\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nABN AMRO is involved in a number of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business in various jurisdictions. In presenting the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements, management estimates the outcome of legal, regulatory and arbitration matters, and takes provisions to the income statement when losses with respect to such matters are more likely than not. Provisions are not recognised for matters for which an expected cash outflow cannot be reasonably estimated or that are not more likely than not to lead to a cash outflow. Some of these matters may be regarded as a contingency. In particular, the following matters are regarded as contingent liabilities:\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00c5 ABN AMRO, certain of its subsidiaries and some of their client funds had exposure to funds that suffered losses (in some cases, significant losses) as a result of the Madoff fraud. The provision of custodial services resulted in several legal claims, including by the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities trustee in bankruptcy (Irving Picard) and the liquidators of certain funds, who are pursuing legal action in an attempt to recover payments made as a result of the fraud and/or to compensate their alleged losses. ABN AMRO and certain ABN AMRO subsidiaries are defendants in these proceedings. Even though these proceedings have been ongoing for several years, they are still in a preliminary stage. Hence, it is not possible to estimate the total amount of ABN AMRO's potential liability, if any.\n- \u00c5 The Imtech Group was declared bankrupt in August 2015. ABN AMRO was one of the banks that extended financing to this group and participated in the second rights offering of October 2014. By letter of 20 January 2018, Stichting Imtechclaim and Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. held ING, Rabobank, Commerzbank and ABN AMRO liable for alleged misstatements in the prospectuses and for alleged actio pauliana (fraudulent preference). By letter of 28 March 2018, the VEB held parties, including ABN AMRO, liable for damage allegedly suffered by the Imtech investors. On 10 August 2018, ABN AMRO received formal notification from Imtech's trustees that they were seeking to nullify a large number of transactions and claim various damages. The letter aimed to interrupt limitation periods in view of the possible claims against Imtech's lenders, bondholders and underwriting banks. It appears likely that litigation will be started by the trustees in view of this letter and subsequent communications, although the exact timing of this litigation, the amount/uni00A0of the/uni00A0claim and the parties to be summoned are unclear. Two execution-only clients of ABN AMRO have commenced proceedings against ABN AMRO and are claiming an amount in excess of EUR 600,000. Their claim is based on alleged prospectus liability, together with an alleged breach of the duty of care. The District Court of Amsterdam dismissed the claims of the two-execution only clients in March 2020. An appeal was lodged in 2020 and the matter is pending before the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam.\n- \u00c5 On 18 October 2018, Eurostar Diamond Traders N.V. (EDT) filed a civil law complaint against ABN AMRO in the Antwerp Court, claiming a provisional amount of EUR 673 million. The amount claimed included/uni00A0an unsubstantiated claim for damages of EUR/uni00A0600 million on the ground that ABN AMRO and Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) allegedly deliberately caused EDT's demise. Damages of USD 73 million were also claimed for the alleged sale of unsuitable derivatives. EDT and Eurostar Diamond Traders International N.V., EDT's parent company, were both declared bankrupt in a final decision in 2020. In August 2020, the EDT-appointed trustees indicated that they did not want to continue pursuing this claim. On 11 December 2020, ABN AMRO, SCB and the EDT trustees reached an amicable settlement. This settlement will become/uni00A0final when approved by the supervisory judge and the Bankruptcy Court of Antwerp. The approval from the supervisory /uni00A0 judge/uni00A0was obtained. The approval from the Bankruptcy Court of Antwerp is now scheduled for 18 March 2021.\n- \u00c5 First Data Holding (FDH) and some of its group companies have indicated that they believe that one of FDH's/uni00A0subsidiaries, European Merchant Services B.V (EMS), has a claim against International Card Services B.V. (ICS). In spring 2016, FDH claimed for the first time that EMS was entitled to 51% of the proceeds of the sale of Visa Europe in 2015. The alleged claim amounted/uni00A0to approximately EUR 37 million plus interest. In August 2016, ICS refuted this claim. In September 2020, FDH repeated its alleged claim. In October 2020, EMS and FDH (now Fiserv) interrupted the limitation periods relating to EMS's alleged claim. In December 2020, ICS responded by rejecting this alleged claim again. As yet, however, EMS itself has not filed any claim against/uni00A0ICS. As a result, it has to be awaited whether and when EMS files such claim.\n- \u00c5 In February 2018, ABN AMRO sold its Luxembourg subsidiary to BGL BNP Paribas (BGL). BGL is now being sued by a Luxembourg fund, LFP I SICAV SIF (LFP), which alleges/uni00A0that the Luxembourg subsidiary, in its capacity as custodian of a/uni00A0sub-fund of LFP (Columna), should have prevented an investment of USD 10 million from being made. LFP is claiming restitution of this/uni00A0amount/uni00A0from BGL in procedures before the District Court of Luxembourg. BGL notified ABN AMRO of/uni00A0this claim in January 2020/uni00A0and, in June 2020, summoned it to appear in these proceedings in an intervention procedure./uni00A0In July 2020, LFP and its Hong Kong subsidiary issued an additional claim against BGL. This claim amounts/uni00A0to USD/uni00A037.5/uni00A0million and also seems to be in respect of investments relating to/uni00A0Columna. Since August 2020, this additional claim has also been part of the intervention procedure between BGL and ABN AMRO. In August 2020, BGL reserved its (alleged) rights to file possible further claims against ABN AMRO, also in relation to LFP. As a result, it has to be awaited whether BGL will institute any further additional claims/uni00A0in this matter.\n- \u00c5 At the end of 2019, ABN AMRO and the Dutch labour unions reached agreement on the renewal of ABN AMRO's collective labour agreement (CLA). ABN AMRO requested Stichting Pensioenfonds van de ABN AMRO Bank N.V (AAPF) to accept the related renewed implementation agreement. According to AAPF, this agreement is not acceptable/uni00A0as it no longer includes an annual payment obligation of EUR 25 million/uni00A0by/uni00A0ABN AMRO to/uni00A0AAPF. In December 2019, the parties agreed that (i) AAPF would refrain from claiming ABN AMRO's alleged obligation for 2020 and 2021 as a pragmatic gesture to ABN AMRO so as to avoid obstructing the renewal of the CLA, and (ii) AAPF would/uni00A0start arbitration proceedings against ABN AMRO in an attempt to obtain an declaratory award with respect to ABN AMRO's alleged annual payment obligation from 2022 onwards. In these proceedings, AAPF is claiming/uni00A0payment of an annual amount of EUR 25 million from/uni00A0ABN AMRO from 2022 onwards for the duration of the implementation agreement, which is for an indefinite period. A hearing is planned for June 2021.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00c5 Other contingent liabilities include EUR 103 million related to an irrevocable payment commitment (IPC) to the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Brussels. In April 2016, the SRB provided credit institutions with the option to fulfil part of their obligation to pay the annual ex-ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) through IPCs. To secure full and punctual payment, if/uni00A0called by the SRB, credit institutions needed to constitute cash collateral and fully transfer legal ownership to the SRB.\n\n## 35  Remuneration of Executive Board and Supervisory Board Remuneration of Executive Board\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO's remuneration policy has been formally approved by shareholders and adopted by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe following statement summarises the income components for the individual Executive Board members./uni00A0\n\n|                     | 2020          | 2020                                  | 2020                                   | 2020                      | 2020                                  | 2020                                  | 2020                | 2020    |\n|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|\n|                     | Base   salary | Compensation  for lease car  expenses | Benefits from  mortgage  interest rate | Variable   remuneration 6 | Total pension-related contributions 7 | Total pension-related contributions 7 | Severance  payments | Total 8 |\n| (In thousands)      |               |                                       |                                        |                           | Post-employment  pension (a)          | Short-term  allowances (b)            |                     |         |\n| R.A.J.

The non-cash bonus qualifies as a cash-settled share-based payment plan as defined by/uni00A0IFRS 2.\n\nThe compensation is granted for a certain performance year. Up to and including the performance year 2019, it was granted for 50% in cash and for 50% in the form of non-cash (depositary receipt) compensation. The non-cash compensation vests for 30% two years after the performance year. The remaining 20% vests in three equal tranches in the third, fourth and fifth year following the performance year. The vesting conditions include a retention period until the non-cash award is settled and performance conditions that apply until two years before settlement. Bad leaver conditions also apply./uni00A0 At the end of the vesting period, participants receive the cash value of the five-day average of an ABN AMRO listed depositary receipt.\n\nAs from performance year 2020, the depositary receipts will be replaced by a performance certificate as non-cash compensation. The non-cash compensation vests for 30% in the first year. The remaining 20% vests in equal instalments in/uni00A0each ofthe four years after the first payment. The value of the performance certificates depends on the five-day average of/uni00A0an ABN AMRO listed depositary receipt at the end of the vesting period. A one-year retention period applies to the non-cash compensation.\n\nA liability is recognised for the fair value of cash-settled transactions. The fair value is measured initially and at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in employee benefits expense.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The/uni00A0fair/uni00A0value is determined using an internally developed model based on the share price and market expectations of future dividends. Non-cash compensation granted for 2019 and the years before give the option to request depositary receipts (DRs) rather than cash. This choice can be made during the quarter in which settlement takes place and is subject to Supervisory Board approval. This equity component in the plan is valued at nil until the request is approved. Participants receive the same amount of fair value, regardless of whether they choose cash or DRs. If participants choose DRs, the value of the depositary receipts is transferred in its entirety from the liability to an equity account. The actual delivery to the participant is expected to take place in the same quarter as the choice is made.\n\nThe cash bonus in this revised variable compensation plan is recorded based on IAS 19. ABN/uni00A0AMRO will not issue additional shares, but will buy shares in the market when needed. As the purchase of shares is expected to take place in the quarter during which the DRs are delivered, there is no impact on (diluted) earnings per share.\n\nThe carrying amount of the liability relating to the non-cash award at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 was EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million (2019:/uni00A0EUR/uni00A011/uni00A0million).\n\nNo expense was recognised in 2020 for the variable compensation plan. The variable compensation plan led to a net gain of EUR 2.6 million, which is the result of the cancellation of depositary receipts of several Identified Staff and a decrease in the share price. For 2020 no depositary receipts were granted to Dutch and non-core Identified Staff. The expense recognised for the variable compensation plan during 2019 was EUR 14 million. The 2019 IFRS 2 expense includes the costs for 2016, 2017 and 2018 because the non-cash variable compensation for these years became a share-based payment plan, as defined by IFRS, when the Supervisory Board approved the variable compensation plan in the first quarter of 2019.

In 2019, NatWest Markets N.V. (formerly known as RBS N.V.) acquired all the shares in RFS Holdings. However, NLFI has given certain warranties related to the shares it previously owned in RFS Holdings and this indemnity agreement continues to exist. As/uni00A0RFS Holdings is sufficiently capitalised, ABN/uni00A0AMRO has assessed the risk of any shortfall as remote./uni00A0\n\nTransactions conducted with the Dutch State are limited to normal banking transactions, taxation and other administrative relationships. Normal banking transactions relate to loans and deposits, financial assets held for trading and financial investments, and are entered into under the same commercial and market terms that apply to non-related parties.\n\nTransactions and balances related to taxation, such as levies in the Netherlands, are excluded from the above table. Transactions and balances related to taxation are included in Note 10 Income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities. Most/uni00A0of the tax items in this note consist of transactions and balances with the Dutch tax authorities.\n\nThe regulatory charges relating to the Dutch State are included in Note 9 General and administrative expenses.\n\nThe increase of EUR/uni00A00.2 billion/uni00A0in financial assets held for trading mainly related to higher amounts of Dutch government bonds as a result of the primary dealership in the Netherlands and client facilitation. Most of these contracts are hedged with/uni00A0short positions in government bonds.\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A00.3 billion in derivatives related to assets was mainly due to lower lending positions with the Dutch State. Derivatives transactions with the Dutch State are related to the normal course of business.\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A00.3 billion/uni00A0in loans and advances customers was due to higher cash collateral pledged as a result of/uni00A0a/uni00A0decrease in financial liabilities held for trading.\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A00.5 billion/uni00A0in derivatives related to liabilities was mainly due to lower lending positions with the Dutch State. Derivatives transactions with the Dutch State are related to the normal course of business./uni00A0\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A00.1 billion/uni00A0in due to customers is attributable to the redemption on 3/uni00A0October/uni00A02008 of part of the loan/uni00A0(including accrued interest) acquired from the Dutch State and relating to Ageas.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Other\n\n<!-- image -->",

ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. applies the option as included in Section/uni00A02:362 paragraph 8. ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. prepares its Consolidated Annual Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS)./uni00A0Reference is made to the accounting policies section in/uni00A0the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and the respective notes.\n\n## Corporate information\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank N.V. is registered at Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number 34334259).\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are applicable to financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI. These requirements also apply to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated upon consolidation. In ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank's Company Annual Financial Statements, the elimination of expected credit losses on intercompany transactions with subsidiaries is recognised in the carrying amount of the loans and advances and participating interests in group companies.\n\nParticipating interests in group companies are measured at net asset value, determined on the basis of EU IFRS. The share in/uni00A0the results of participating interests in group companies is reported in accordance with the principles of valuation and profit determination that apply to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and presentation currency of the company, rounded to the nearest/uni00A0million (unless otherwise stated).\n\n## 2 Net interest income\n\nNet interest income for 2020 amounted to EUR/uni00A03,354/uni00A0million, a decrease of EUR/uni00A0597/uni00A0million compared to EUR/uni00A03,951/uni00A0million in 2019.\n\nNet interest income is comprised of interest income from loans, investments and other lending, interest expense on borrowings by ABN/uni00A0AMRO and client accounts, as well as the results from interest rate and foreign exchange contracts entered into for hedging purposes. Interest income from loans and advances customers amounted to EUR/uni00A02,228/uni00A0million (2019: EUR/uni00A03,162/uni00A0million).\n\n## 3 Results from financial transactions\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                            |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Securities trading and derivatives transactions |    208 |    119 |\n| Foreign exchange transaction results            |    104 |     26 |\n| Other                                           |     12 |     78 |\n| Total results from financial transactions       |    324 |    223 |\n\nResults from financial transactions increased by EUR 101 million in 2020 to EUR 324 million. This was due to results from interest rate derivatives and an increase in foreign exchange transaction results, partly offset by the derecognition gain from the public sector loans sold in the previous year, which is reflected in Other.\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\nLeadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was mainly due to the sale of a majority stake in Stater N.V. in 2019.\n\n## 6 Personnel expenses\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                               | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Salaries and wages                                 | 1,180  | 1,135  |\n| Social security charges                            | 146    | 162    |\n| Pension expenses relating to defined benefit plans |        | -3     |\n| Defined contribution plan expenses                 | 256    | 314    |\n| Other                                              | 139    | 78     |\n| Total personnel expenses                           | 1,720  | 1,686  |\n\nThe increase of EUR/uni00A034/uni00A0million in total personnel expenses in 2020 was mainly caused by other personnel expenses. These/uni00A0increased by EUR/uni00A061/uni00A0million, largely due to higher restructuring provisions in 2020 as a result of the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio. In addition, salaries and wages increased by EUR/uni00A044/uni00A0million, mainly driven by an increase in FTE levels following the AML remediation programmes and a 2.75% increase in salaries under the Collective Labour Agreement. This increase was partly offset by the decrease in discretionary bonuses due to the value decrease of ABN/uni00A0AMRO shares.\n\nThe decrease of EUR/uni00A058/uni00A0million/uni00A0in defined contribution plan expenses further offset the increases and was attributable to a new pension plan, as stated in the Collective Labour Agreement, and a one-off payment of EUR/uni00A030/uni00A0million to the pension fund in 2019. Additionally, social security charges decreased by EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0million, mainly due to a change in Dutch unemployment benefit (the previous Sectorfonds and WW schemes were replaced by a general unemployment fund in 2020).\n\n## 7 Cash and balances at central banks\n\nCash and balances at central banks increased by EUR/uni00A031.8 billion, mainly due to the participation in the new TLTRO III programme (EUR/uni00A032.0 billion), partly offset by the redemption of the old TLTRO programme (EUR/uni00A08.0 billion) and higher volumes on accounts due to a general spending decrease as a result of Covid-19 (EUR/uni00A08.5 billion).\n\nDuring 2020, ABN/uni00A0AMRO changed its presentation of instant payment facilities from corporate loans/uni00A0at amortised cost to cash and balances at central banks. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly (EUR/uni00A00.5 billion).\n\n## 8 Short-term government paper\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                                                              | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Short-term government paper held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 38,727                           | 37,018                           |\n| Short-term government paper held for trading                                      | 639                              | 486                              |\n| Short-term government paper                                                       | 39,366                           | 37,505                           |\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\n## Risk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nConsolidated Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements\n\nCompany Annual Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nNotes to the Company Annual/uni00A0Financial/uni00A0Statements of/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO/uni00A0Bank/uni00A0N.V.\n\nOther\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the TLTROs the ECB offers banks long-term funding at attractive conditions, with the aim to further incentivise bank lending to the real economy. The maturity of the TLTRO III funding is three years, with a quarterly early repayment option as of September 2021. Interest will be settled in arrears. The interest rate to be applied is linked to the issuance of new loans to non-financial corporations and households. The funding is accounted for at amortised cost, with an effective interest rate equal to the Main Refinancing Operations rate. For the period of 24 June 2020 to 23 June 2022, a discount of 50bps/uni00A0is granted, irrespective of lending performance. The guaranteed discount of 50bps is accounted for as a government grant and/uni00A0recognised in interest income. Any additional discount achieved based on ABN AMRO's lending performance will also be accounted for as a government grant. Given the current economic circumstances and uncertainties related to/uni00A0Covid-19,/uni00A0ABN/uni00A0AMRO did not recognise any additional discount in 2020.\n\n## 18  Due to customers\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Group companies        | 6,128                            | 6,778                            |\n| Third parties          | 223,169                          | 217,384                          |\n| Due to customers       | 229,297                          | 224,161                          |\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Current accounts       | 100,855                          | 81,522                           |\n| Demand deposits        | 102,036                          | 114,791                          |\n| Time deposits          | 13,025                           | 15,609                           |\n| Total deposits         | 215,916                          | 211,922                          |\n| Securities financing   | 8,926                            | 7,009                            |\n| Other due to customers | 4,455                            | 5,231                            |\n| Due to customers       | 229,297                          | 224,161                          |\n\nDue to customers increased by EUR/uni00A05.1 billion, mainly as a result of an increase in current accounts and securities financing.

The increase in the restructuring provisions was mainly related to the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio.\n\n## Legal provisions\n\nLegal provisions are based on best estimates available at the year-end, taking into account the opinion of legal specialists. The timing of the outflow of cash related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and the time required to conclude litigation. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. Legal provisions decreased by EUR/uni00A053/uni00A0million at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, mainly as a result of compensation paid out and a release of the provision for SME derivatives-related issues.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions decreased mainly due to the usage of the AML remediation programmes provision.\n\n## AML remediation programmes\n\nBanks are considered gatekeepers of the financial system, which is a responsibility that ABN AMRO takes very seriously. ABN AMRO invests significant resources in fulfilling its role as gatekeeper in general and specifically in combating financial crime, and works closely with regulators, governments, other banks and other authorities. ABN AMRO has further increased its ongoing efforts to strengthen its AML remediation programmes in order to be compliant with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation. We have implemented multiple remediation programmes, including for remediating the Retail client portfolio. We are also investing further resources in strengthening the necessary processes, as well as in further improving systems required to assist efforts to combat financial crime. On a general note, all remedial action necessary to/uni00A0ensure full, bank-wide compliance with legislation at all times will be taken. In view of the current criminal investigation to/uni00A0which the bank is subject, sanctions (such as an instruction or fines) may be imposed by the authorities. Reference is made in this respect to Note 34 Commitments and contingent liabilities in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## 22  Other liabilities\n\n| (in/uni00A0millions)                   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020   | 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Financial liabilities held for trading | 563                              | 675                              |\n| Derivatives                            | 7,386                            | 6,495                            |\n| Current tax liabilities                | 5                                | 10                               |\n| Other                                  | 1,531                            | 1,742                            |\n| Other liabilities                      | 9,485                            | 8,921                            |\n\nOther liabilities at/uni00A031/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 increased by EUR/uni00A00.5 billion, mainly due to higher derivatives.

(hereinafter: ABN AMRO or the bank), based in Amsterdam. The financial statements comprise the consolidated and company annual financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00c5 the accompanying consolidated annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ABN AMRO as at 31/uni00A0December 2020 and of its result and its cash flows for 2020 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book/uni00A02 of the Dutch Civil Code\n- \u00c5 the accompanying company annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ABN AMRO as at 31/uni00A0December 2020 and of its result for 2020 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n\nThe consolidated annual financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00c5 the consolidated statement of financial position as/uni00A0at/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2020\n- \u00c5 the following statements for 2020: the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statements of/uni00A0comprehensive income, changes in equity and/uni00A0cash/uni00A0flows\n- \u00c5 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nThe company annual financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00c5 the company statement of financial position as/uni00A0at/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2020\n- \u00c5 the company income statement for 2020\n- \u00c5 the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n## Basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described/uni00A0in the Our responsibilities for the audit of/uni00A0the/uni00A0financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of ABN AMRO in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Our understanding of the business\n\nABN/uni00A0AMRO provides a/uni00A0broad range of financial services to retail, private and corporate banking clients. These activities are conducted primarily in the Netherlands and selectively abroad. The bank is at the head of a group of entities and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by/uni00A0the operations of the group and our risk assessment.\n\nWe start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud, non-compliance with laws and regulations or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 measures, we were forced to perform our procedures to a greater extent remotely. In order to compensate for the limitations related to physical contact and direct observation, we performed alternative procedures to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Other\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nOther information\n\nCautionary statements\n\nEnquiries\n\n<!-- image -->",

Due to the financial performance of ABN AMRO in 2020, we considered  adjusted profit before taxation no longer to be an appropriate benchmark. The benchmark of 0.7% of total equity provides a similar  materiality (amount) as in previous years. |\n\nWe have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR/uni00A07 million, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nABN AMRO is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated annual financial statements of ABN AMRO.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant group entities in the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United States based on size and risk. We have:\n\n- \u00c5 Performed audit procedures ourselves at group entities in the Netherlands\n- \u00c5 Used the work of other auditors within our EY network when auditing the group entities in France, Germany and/uni00A0the United States\n- \u00c5 Performed review procedures or specific audit procedures at other group entities\n\nBecause of the (international) travel restrictions and social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we used communication technology and written information exchange, e.g. intensified communication with component audit teams, in order to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence.\n\nIn total these procedures represent 92% of the group's total assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe sent instructions to component auditors, covering the significant areas and the information required to be reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, we held virtual site visits with the component teams in France, Germany and the United States. These site visits were virtual due to Covid-19 and encompassed some, or all, of the following activities: reviewing key local working papers and conclusions, meeting with local management teams and obtaining an understanding of key processes. We interacted regularly with the component teams during various stages of the audit, through the use of video or teleconferencing facilities. Where deemed appropriate, we attended certain component closing meetings with management, also using video or teleconferencing facilities. We reviewed key working papers of component auditors using the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or by the provision of copies of work papers direct to the group audit team.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Other\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nOther information Cautionary statements Enquiries\n\n<!-- image -->",

We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, and income tax and have made use of our own experts in the areas of valuation of derivatives and financial investments, credit risk modelling, macro-economic forecasting, regulatory reporting, goodwill, legal, and actuarial assumptions.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.\n\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations may result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the bank that may have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nIn order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud, we obtained an understanding of the bank and its environment, including the bank's internal control relevant to the audit, in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal control. We do not audit internal control per se for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the bank's internal control.\n\nWe considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors (including internal audit, legal, compliance, and risk management) and the Supervisory Board. As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud and misappropriation of assets in close cooperation with our forensic specialists.\n\nIn our process of identifying fraud risks, we considered whether the Covid-19 pandemic gives rise to specific fraud risk factors resulting from a dilution in the effectiveness of controls as a result of the general disruption associated with remote working, illness and workforce reductions, management overrides and workarounds becoming the norm, manual invoicing and manual payments and increased pressure on management to meet financial targets.\n\nWe evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks. In/uni00A0addition, we performed procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in note 1 (Critical accounting estimates and judgments) to the financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and/uni00A0address high-risk journal entries.\n\nOur audit procedures to address the assessed fraud risks did not result in a key audit matter. However, we describe the audit procedures responsive to the assessed fraud risk related to the risk of management override of controls in the description of our audit approach for the key audit matter on impairment allowances for loans and advances customers.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud. If so, we reevaluate our assessment of fraud risk and/uni00A0its resulting impact on our audit procedures.\n\n## Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry experience through discussions with the Executive Board, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports, inspection of lawyers' letters, inspection of communication with regulatory authorities, and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\n## Annual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Other\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nOther information\n\nCautionary statements\n\nEnquiries\n\n<!-- image -->",

The bank is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including corporate tax law, financial reporting regulations and requirements under Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nAlso, the bank is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in/uni00A0the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We are not responsible for/uni00A0preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to/uni00A0detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, we also inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally we obtained written representations from management that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us. We make reference to the key audit matters on provisions and contingent liabilities for legal claims and compliance matters and on the investigation on compliance with the Dutch Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe performed the following procedures in order to identify and assess the risks of going concern and to conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting. Management made a specific assessment of the bank's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated the assessment with management exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism, and specifically focusing on the process followed by management to make the assessment, management bias that could represent a risk, the impact of current events and conditions have on the bank's operations and forecasted cash flows, with a focus on whether the bank will have sufficient liquidity to continue to meet its obligations as they fall due.\n\nWe consider based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a/uni00A0material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in/uni00A0the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\n\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## General audit procedures\n\nOur audit further included among others:\n\n- \u00c5 Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion\n- \u00c5 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Executive Board\n- \u00c5 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures\n- \u00c5 Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nFollowing the Covid-19 pandemic, a new key audit matter has been defined.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Other\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nOther information\n\nCautionary statements\n\nEnquiries\n\n<!-- image -->",

This included testing data accuracy and completeness, data transfers, staging, impairment calculation and reporting.\n\nWe analysed the impairment allowance in relation to developments in the loan portfolio and composition of the portfolio. We performed testing on data, staging, models and impairment calculations. To verify data quality, we tested the data used in the calculation by reconciling to source systems and underlying documentation on a sample basis.\n\nFor collectively assessed loan impairment allowances, we involved EY modelling specialists to assess the appropriateness of the modelling methodology. We inspected and discussed internal model validation reports. We challenged the assumptions, like the use of/uni00A0macro-economic scenarios and variables such as unemployment rates and housing prices, in the development and validation of ECL/uni00A0model updates.\n\nFor macro-economic variables, we challenged management's macro-economic forecast and scenarios, including the impact of Covid-19, with the support of internal economic specialists using external benchmarks.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the loans and advances customers amounted to EUR 252.2 billion net of loan impairment allowances for loans and advances customers amounting to EUR 3.5 billion, as disclosed in note 20 (Loans and advances customers) and the sections Credit risk management and Credit risk in the Executive Board report.\n\nThe impairment allowance represents the bank's best estimate of expected credit losses (ECL) on the loans and advances customers at balance sheet date. The ECL of stage 1 and stage 2 loans is calculated collectively, as is the ECL of stage 3 loan portfolios of a similar nature and below a certain threshold. The ECL on the remaining stage 3 loan exposures is calculated individually.\n\nThe determination of the impairment allowance requires considerable management judgment. The most significant judgments in estimating the impairment allowance include the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the identification of defaulted exposures. Furthermore, the ECL is calculated with complex models based on historical data, assumptions and forward-looking information, including multiple macro-economic scenarios; these models are updated and enhanced periodically.\n\nFor individually assessed impairments, multiple scenarios for future cashflow projections and collateral valuation are considered. The Covid-19 pandemic increases the estimation uncertainty following unprecedented economic circumstances and resulted in management overlays of EUR 290 million as disclosed in the section Credit risk (Individual and collective loan impairment allowances) in the Executive Board report.\n\nAs loans and advances customers and the associated loan impairment allowance are material to the bank's balance sheet and income statement and due to the high estimation uncertainty on the loan impairment allowance, we consider this a key audit matter.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Other\n\nIndependent auditor's report\n\nOther information\n\nCautionary statements\n\nEnquiries\n\n<!-- image -->",

We challenged the underlying assumptions and tested the data used.\n\n## Key observations\n\nWe assessed retrospective review procedures which compare modelled predictions with actual results. For certain portfolios, we developed our independent estimate to address the estimation uncertainty inherent in expected credit loss estimations.\n\nFor individually assessed loan impairment allowances, we selected individual loans risk-based across all stages and performed detailed credit file reviews to assess whether the bank correctly applied its credit risk and staging policy. We challenged the recovery scenarios applied and the weighting of these scenarios. With the support of internal valuation specialists, we assessed the assumptions underlying the loan impairment calculation, such as estimated future cash flows and collateral valuations. Furthermore, we reperformed the impairment calculation based on those inputs.\n\nFinally, we evaluated whether the disclosures are accurate and in compliance with EU-IFRS requirements.\n\nBased on our procedures performed we consider the impairment allowances for loans and advances customers to be reasonable. The/uni00A0disclosures on loans and advances customers and loan impairment allowance are considered adequate and appropriate and meet the/uni00A0requirements under EU-IFRS.\n\nWe highlighted the following items to the Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00c5 Our testing and sensitivity analysis on the staging criteria did not identify material differences and overall we concluded that the/uni00A0stage allocation as per 31 December 2020 was reasonable;\n- \u00c5 We assessed the management overlays and its underlying assumptions as per 31 December 2020 which we concluded to be reasonable;\n- \u00c5 For individually assessed impairments we reported certain judgmental differences in respect of the timing of the impairment identified, however none of these were considered material.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities for legal claims and compliance matters\n\nRisk\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nAt 31 December 2020, an amount of EUR 98 million was recorded for legal provisions and EUR 258 million for other provisions which includes EUR 176 million relating to remediation programmes in order to become compliant with anti-money laundering (AML) legislation, as disclosed in note 29 (Provisions). Within note 34 (Commitments and contingent liabilities) compliance related matters are regarded as contingencies, such as the investigation of the Dutch prosecutor on the requirements under the Dutch Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism (Wwft), the equity trading investigation in Germany and a number of duty of care proceedings.\n\nA provision is recognized when ABN AMRO has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an/uni00A0economic outflow will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Management judgment is needed to determine whether an obligation exists and a provision should be recorded. In case the outflow of/uni00A0economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed.\n\nDue to the high level of judgment and the significant amounts involved, we consider this a key audit matter.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the entity level controls and the legal and regulatory framework of the bank. On a periodic basis, we enquired with the Executive Board, Legal department and Compliance department to understand and assess existing and potentially new constructive and legal obligations, and compliance matters. Furthermore, we inspected legal and compliance management reports and internal audit reports. We read the minutes of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and reported our observations to the Executive and Supervisory Board.\n\nWe obtained legal letters from external counsel to understand regulatory compliance and legal matters ABN AMRO is involved in. Furthermore, we inspected and discussed progress reports of the remediation programs. We inspected the correspondence with the relevant regulatory authorities to assess developments in regulatory matters. EY legal and compliance specialists were involved in these/uni00A0procedures.\n\nFor the significant provisions and contingent liabilities recognized or disclosed, among others, we:\n\n- \u00c5 Assessed whether the provisions and contingent liabilities meet the EU-IFRS recognition criteria;\n- \u00c5 Obtained an understanding of the provisioning methodology and the process and internal controls over the identification, estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions;\n- \u00c5 Challenged the underlying assumptions and tested the data used;\n- \u00c5 Performed test of details on the provisioning level and assessed the assumptions and judgments made by the bank, including the number of files to be remediated, the time needed to remediate each file and the use of external resources in the remediation;\n- \u00c5 Assessed the reasonableness of the judgments applied by management by considering possible outcomes and sensitivity of the judgments on the provisions and contingent liabilities;\n- \u00c5 Assessed historical data to verify the current estimation of provisions.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures related to provisions and contingent liabilities and whether these/uni00A0disclosures are in compliance with EU-IFRS requirements.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Other\n\nIndependent auditor's report\n\nOther information\n\nCautionary statements\n\nEnquiries\n\n<!-- image -->",

We held regular bilateral meetings with the chairs of the Supervisory Board, Audit Committee and Risk & Capital Committee.\n\nOn a periodic basis, we enquired with the Executive Board, the Legal department and Compliance department of the bank to understand and discuss existing and potentially new constructive and legal obligations following the investigation of the public prosecutor. Furthermore, we inspected ABN AMRO's internal legal and compliance reports.\n\nWe also inspected underlying documentation of internal investigations performed and other relevant documents like progress reports in relation to the remediation program. We obtained legal letters from and inquired with external legal counsel to understand any potential obligation. We involved our internal legal specialists to assist in evaluating management assertions. We also obtained specific management representations in relation to compliance with laws and regulations and the investigation.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures related to contingent liabilities and whether these disclosures are/uni00A0in compliance with EU-IFRS requirements.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we concur that no provision is recorded as per 31 December 2020 due to the fact that the investigation is currently still ongoing and no reliable estimate can be made of the outcome. The disclosure on contingent liabilities related to the investigation is considered adequate and appropriate and meets the requirements under EU-IFRS.\n\nWe highlighted the following items to the Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00c5 We have validated management's assessment of the contingent liability which we determined to be reasonable;\n- \u00c5 We are satisfied that no provision is recorded as the amount of the possible obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability;\n\nIn previous years, non-compliance with the Dutch Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism was identified by the Dutch Central Bank. Structural shortcomings in the underlying processes were noted during different inspections, followed by ABN AMRO accelerating the different remediation programmes in order to be compliant with anti-money laundering legislation.\n\nSubsequent to the regulatory findings of the Dutch Central Bank, ABN AMRO is since 2019 subject of an investigation by the Dutch public prosecutor relating to requirements under the Dutch Act on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism. The scope of the investigation of the Dutch public prosecutor focusses on non-compliance with the applicable legislation related to client due diligence, timely reporting of unusual transactions, timely discontinuing client relationships and related suspicions of culpable money laundering.\n\nA provision for any potential fine or settlement can only be recorded if there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an economic outflow will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Management judgment is needed to determine whether an obligation exists and a provision should be recorded. In case the outflow of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is/uni00A0disclosed.\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized in the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is remote. A contingent liability related to the investigation has been disclosed in note 34 (Commitments and contingent liabilities).\n\nManagement concluded that the timing of the completion of the investigation and the outcome are uncertain, so that no reliable estimate can be made of any potential outflow and consequently no provision is recorded as per 31 December 2020.\n\nDue to the significance of the investigation and its possible outcome, we consider this a key audit matter.\n\n## Introduction\n\n## Strategy & performance\n\nRisk, funding &/uni00A0capital\n\n## Leadership & governance\n\nAnnual Financial Statements 2020\n\n## Other\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nOther information\n\nCautionary statements\n\nEnquiries\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the Executive Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, the/uni00A0Executive Board is responsible for assessing the bank's ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Executive Board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Executive Board either intends to liquidate the bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Executive Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the bank's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the/uni00A0bank's financial reporting process.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial/uni00A0statements\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.\n\nOur audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.\n\nWe have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in/uni00A0accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. The Our audit approach section above includes an informative summary of our responsibilities and the work performed as/uni00A0the basis for our opinion.\n\n## Communication\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nIn this respect we also submit an additional report to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board in accordance with Article/uni00A011 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all/uni00A0relationships and other matters that may reasonably be/uni00A0thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.\n\nAmsterdam, 9/uni00A0March 2021\n\nErnst & Young Accountants LLP\n\nW.J.
